				<p>Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to changes in healthcare. Government and regulatory bodies have advocated the need for transparency in AI systems with recommendations to provide users with more details about AI accuracy and how AI systems work. However, increased transparency could lead to negative outcomes if humans become over-reliant on the technology. This study investigated how changes in AI transparency affected human decision making in a medical screening visual search task. Transparency was manipulated by either giving or withholding knowledge about the accuracy of an &apos;AI system&apos;. We tested performance in seven simulated lab mammography tasks, in which observers searched for a cancer which could be correctly or incorrectly flagged by Computer Aided Detection (CAD) &apos;AI prompts&apos;. Across tasks the CAD systems varied in accuracy. In the &apos;Transparent&apos; conditions participants were told the accuracy of the CAD system, in the &apos;Not Transparent&apos; they were not. The results showed that increasing CAD transparency impaired task performance producing an increase in false alarms, decreased sensitivity, an increase in Recall Rate and a decrease in Positive Predictive Value. Along with increasing investment in AI this research shows that it is important to investigate how transparency of AI systems affect human decision making. Increased transparency may lead to over-trust in AI systems, which can impact clinical outcomes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In recent years developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to important changes in healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kerasidou et al., 2022)</ref>. It has been proposed that AI may help with tasks such as workflow and clinical administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Mello-Thoms &amp; Mello, 2023)</ref>, the optimisation of clinical trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Askin et al., 2023)</ref>, and medical imaging with predictions that AI use in this area will grow dramatically in future years <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen et al., 2021)</ref> In medical screening, Computer Aided Detection (CAD) uses computer algorithms to alert readers to the presence of suspicious entities, such as cancers in mammograms. Historically, there have been conflicting results on the benefit of this technology. Although CAD was approved by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in the late 1990s and rolled out at great financial cost (estimated at over $400 million per annum, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lehman et al., 2015)</ref> little research was conducted to examine how these automatic aids affected human decision making.</p><p>Subsequent studies showed mixed benefits in relation to CAD use -some positive with increased detection of early-stage malignancies <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Freer and Ulissey, 2001)</ref>, whereas other studies showed little benefit <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Lehman et al., 2015)</ref>. Furthermore, some studies showed harmful results, where CAD led to reduced accuracy of mammogram interpretation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fenton et al., 2007)</ref> and clinicians missed more cancers if not marked by CAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Zheng et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Taplin et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Recent advancements in AI, however, have shown promising results in CAD use. AI acting as a supporting reader produced similar performance to double reading procedures (where two human readers read the same mammogram) while also reducing the number of cases that humans had to read <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(McKinney, et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ng et al., 2023)</ref>. Given that there is a shortage of available healthcare workers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Konstantinidis, 2023</ref>) the use of AI as a second reader in tasks such as mammography could provide significant benefits.</p><p>Despite the potential advantages of AI use in medical screening there are also disadvantages.</p><p>Although, the FDA has already approved several AI systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Benjamens, et al., 2020)</ref>, the clinical and cognitive costs of human interaction with these systems are still not fully understood and Human-AI interactions remain largely under-researched. Furthermore, there is considerable evidence showing that people can become over-reliant on this technology (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bucina et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bussone et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jacobs et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kunar et al., 2017)</ref>. This is particularly problematic when the CAD systems either fail to flag a cancer or incorrectly predict the presence of a cancer when there is not one <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kunar et al., 2017)</ref>. In the former case, cancers that are not prompted by CAD, are more likely to go unnoticed, meaning that women will not receive appropriate and timely medical care. The latter means that women will be needlessly recalled for further tests, that can be worrying and also add an extra and unnecessary burden to healthcare systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aro, 2000)</ref>. Other work has found ways to keep the benefits of CAD while mitigating the costs, for example by changing the way AI prompts are presented to readers <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kunar, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Patterson &amp; Kunar, 2024)</ref> or how the CAD systems are framed <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kunar &amp; Watson, 2023)</ref>. Crucially, these studies have shown that what people know about AI systems affect how they are used and their influence on decision making. Given that there is growing investment and support to integrate AI into medical screening <ref type="bibr">(Alexander et al., 2024)</ref> it is critical that we examine how such systems influence human decision making.</p><p>With this growth in AI development, government and regulatory bodies have stipulated the importance of transparency within AI systems <ref type="bibr">(Gov, U.K., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kerasidou et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kingsman et al., 2022)</ref>. AI transparency can refer to making sure humans are aware of how AI systems operate and clarity in their accuracy. Transparency can be achieved through a number of ways. <ref type="bibr">Kiseleva et al., (2022)</ref> suggested that factors such as information about an AI system and its interpretability can affect transparency. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lekadir et al. (2021)</ref> proposed a set of guidelines for AI use in medical screening, which include that readers should be informed about the errors that AI systems make (for example, by showing uncertainty estimates) to increase user trust and usability. However, increasing transparency in AI is often complex and can sometimes lead to negative outcomes if people become too dependent on the system <ref type="bibr">(Bucinca et al., 2021)</ref>. If increased transparency leads to over-trust in the technology this could have significant consequences for clinical outcomes. For example, increasing transparency about CAD may lead to clinicians accepting the CAD recommendation even if it disagrees with their initial judgement.</p><p>We investigated whether increasing transparency of CAD affects search performance in a simulated mammogram task where participants searched for a cancer using seven different CAD conditions. Previous work has shown that laboratory experiments are a reliable way to investigate human reliance on CAD systems (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kunar et al., 2017</ref>, for full details). For example, lab testing allows use of designs that are often not practical, or ethical, in clinical settings, due to the shortage of radiologists and the expense of Randomised Control Trials (RCTs). Furthermore, lab studies allow measures such as miss errors to be observed, which are difficult to determine in a clinical setting given that, by definition, radiologists will be unaware that they have missed a cancer. We can use this measure, along with False Alarms and other breast screening metrics such as Recall Rate (the percentage of mammograms that were reported to have abnormal findings) and Positive Predictive Value (PPV, the percentage of women recalled for further tests who have cancer) to investigate the effects of transparency on decision making with CAD.</p><p>We manipulated transparency across a range of CAD systems that differed in their accuracy to predict a cancer 1 . CAD transparency was manipulated by explicitly telling people the accuracy of the CAD system before use. In Conditions 1-3 participants were asked to interact with a non-transparent CAD system which either accurately predicted the target on 33% of trials, 67% of trials or 83% of trials. In these conditions participants were not told the accuracy of the CAD algorithm. In Conditions 4-6, participants were shown these same systems but explicitly told in advance the CAD accuracy to make performance more transparent. A final seventh condition acted as a No CAD control, to allow comparison to a baseline where CAD was never used. To preview the results, although making the systems more transparent did not affect miss errors, more transparent systems led to a decrease in performance in relation to false alarms, sensitivity (as measured by d'), Recall Rate and PPV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transparency and Openness</head><p>The data and materials are available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/zrafu/). All data were compiled in Microsoft® Excel® for Microsoft 365 MSO (Version 2112 Build 16.0.14729.20254) and imported into JASP (Version 0.16; JASP Team, 2021) for statistical analysis. The experimental programs were written in PsychoPy <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Peirce et al., 2019)</ref> and run via Pavlovia. The study design, hypotheses and analytic plan were not pre-registered. All manipulations, data exclusions and measures are reported.</p><p>1 In a clinical setting the accuracy of CAD is thought to be in the range of 57 -85% but this can vary across systems <ref type="bibr">(Soo et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Obenauer et al., 2006)</ref>. In these experiments a CAD accuracy range of 33% to 83% was used to test whether there were differential effects of transparency on CAD systems that had low or high accuracy rates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Six-hundred and forty-five participants were tested, in which one hundred participants took part in Conditions 1-6 and 44 participants took part in Condition 7 2 . A G*Power calculation determined that this number of participants resulted in an experimental power above of 0.95, (the minimum number of participants needed per condition to achieve this power was 42, Ftests, fixed effects and interactions, alpha = 0.05, effect size = 0.25). Participants were aged 18 or above, recruited via Prolific, and were only able to take part in one experiment. Ethical approval for all studies was granted by the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee at the University of Warwick.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli and Procedure:</head><p>Seven conditions were used to examine performance with different CAD systems. The conditions varied by CAD accuracy and whether people were informed of this. In all conditions, participants were asked to search and respond to a mass presented on a mammogram. Two hundred mammogram images were obtained from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Heath et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr">Heath et al., , 1998</ref>. All original images were randomly selected from the image group that had been confirmed to be cancer free. One hundred and eighty-eight of these images made up the target absent trials (where there was no cancer). The other 12 mammogram images were edited so that they contained a 'cancer'. To do this, four cancers were chosen at random from cancer cases on the DDSM. For each 'target present' image one of these cancers was transposed onto a mammogram that previously contained no cancer. Across the experiment all four cancers were transposed onto the mammograms equally often with the premise that only one cancer would appear on each mammogram. Four cancers were chosen so that there would be a degree of perceptual variability across trials increasing the complexity of search, but the target would remain identifiable by medically naïve readers. The mass could appear on any area of the breast tissue, chosen at random (mimicking conditions in a clinical setting), provided that it was clearly distinguishable once fixated. These stimuli and procedure were chosen as they have previously shown to be successful to use in search tasks with participants who have no formal medical training (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kunar et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Kunar et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kunar, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kunar &amp; Watson, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Patterson &amp; Kunar, 2024)</ref>. At the beginning of the experiment participants were given a training session, where they were shown example images of the mass and mammograms and asked to detect a mass in a mammogram. They could only continue to the experiment proper, once they had passed the training phase in which they had to correctly respond to whether a mammogram contained a cancer or not at a level above 70% accuracy. If participants failed the training session, they repeated it until their accuracy was above 70%. If participants did not reach this level after their fourth attempt, they were still allowed to proceed, however their data were removed from analysis. However, all participants successfully completed the training phase by this point.</p><p>For each condition, the prevalence rate of the cancer was 6%. Conditions 1-6 had participants search for the cancer with the use of a 'CAD system' while Condition 7 acted as a baseline where no 'CAD system' was used. In Conditions 1-6, participants were informed that they may be shown a CAD prompt in the form of a red box. They were also informed that the CAD cue could be accurate and highlight the target item (Correct CAD), but sometimes it could highlight a non-cancerous area even when a cancer was present (Incorrect CAD) or could contain a cancer which was not flagged by CAD (No CAD). For target absent trials, there would either be an Incorrect CAD cue, which would highlight an area that did not contain a cancer, or no CAD cue would be presented. For target absent trials, the lack of CAD would correctly indicate there was no cancer in the display. Example displays are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Across different experiments, the accuracy of CAD's ability to correctly highlight the location of the cancer varied, so that it correctly identified a cancer on either 33%, 67% or 83% of times. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the accuracy rate and number of trials, that either correctly or incorrectly contained a CAD cue, for each condition. All trials were presented in a randomly generated order for each participant. In Conditions 1-3 participants were given no explicit knowledge of the CAD accuracy rate. In Conditions 4-6, participants were explicitly told how accurate the CAD system was (e.g., "In this session the CAD cue (red box) will highlight the cancer 83% of the time"). In Condition 7 participants were asked to search for cancers without the use of a 'CAD system'. In this Condition, participants responded to whether a mammogram contained a cancer or not. None of the mammogram images contained a CAD cue and CAD was not mentioned in the instructions.  For each trial, participants were asked to respond whether there was a cancer in the mammogram image. If they, believed there was a cancer they pressed the key 'm'. If they believed there was no cancer they pressed with the key 'z'. To ensure that the results were not affected by motor errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fleck and Mitroff, 2007)</ref>, participants had to respond a second time,</p><p>to confirm their response. This was done by again pressing the 'm' key for target present responses and 'z' key for target absent responses. This ensured that participants could correct their initial response if they accidently pressed the wrong button. Participants were given a short practice session before the start of the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Incomplete data sets were removed from analyses. This led to the removal of six participants (one participant in Conditions 1, 3, 6 and 7, two participants in Condition 4). To avoid motor errors, the confirmed responses were used to calculate miss errors and false alarms. If performance was negatively affected by transparency we would expect to see a greater proportion of miss errors and/or a greater proportion of false alarms in the Transparent versus the Not Transparent CAD conditions.</p><p>To understand the reason for any differences in error rates across experiment we examined how Sensitivity (as measured by d') and Response Bias (measured by c) changed across CAD Systems using Signal Detection Theory (SDT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Green and</ref><ref type="bibr">Swets, 1967, Macmillan &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr">Creelman, 2005</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= ∑( + ) ∑( + + + ) × 100 = ∑ ∑( + ) × 100</formula><p>If adding transparency affected performance negatively, we would expect to see higher recall rates and lower PPV in the Transparent conditions compared to the Not Transparent conditions.</p><p>For each of these metrics we conducted a 3 x 2 ANOVA with between factors of CAD Accuracy (33%, 67% and 83%) and Transparency (Transparent vs Not Transparent).</p><p>Significant interactions were further analysed using planned t-tests, where we also include Bayesian analyses, as supportive evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Wagenmakers et al., 2018a)</ref>. We only include Bayesian analysis for these planned t-tests rather than ANOVAs as the latter is still an ongoing topic of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Wagenmakers et al., 2018b)</ref>. For our Bayesian analyses, we adopt the recommendations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jeffreys (1961)</ref> in which a BF10 of 1 to 3 provides anecdotal evidence for the alternative, a BF10 of 3 to 10 provides substantial evidence for the alternative, a BF10 of 10 to 30 provides strong evidence for the alternative, a BF10 of 30 to 100 provides very strong evidence for the alternative and a BF10 of greater than 100 provides decisive evidence for the alternative. The inverse of these numbers (BF01) provide evidence in support the null hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jarosz &amp; Wiley, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, data from each CAD Condition (1 -6) were compared to the No CAD control (Condition 7). This enabled us to determine whether there was an overall benefit or cost of CAD, in relation to when no CAD system was used. For each metric six t-tests were run. To compensate for multiple comparisons, we used the Bonferroni correction for with the adjusted alpha levels of 0.008 per test (.05/6). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the data for all conditions.</p></div>

There was a significant main effect of Transparency, F(1, 590) = 10.11, p = .002, ηp 2 = 0.02, in which Recall Rate was higher in the Transparent CAD conditions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>This study examined the effect of transparency on a range of CAD systems that varied in their predictive accuracy. Not surprisingly, the more accurate CAD systems led to better target detection. This increase in accuracy was mostly observed in fewer miss errors given that the CAD accuracy manipulation was specific to target present trials only. More importantly Transparent CAD conditions showed an impairment in performance with increased false alarms, decreased sensitivity, a less conservative response threshold, an increase in Recall Rate (more women being unnecessarily recalled in a clinical setting) and a decrease in PPV (fewer women being recalled who actually had a cancer). Overall, the data showed that increasing transparency by informing people about the accuracy of the CAD system, led to negative performance across a number of metrics. This is of concern given recent government and regulatory body recommendations that AI systems should show increased transparency <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kerasidou et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The shift in false alarms, recall rate and PPV can be explained by the SDT data, which indicated that participants showed a decrease in sensitivity in the transparent conditions and were more likely to report a cancer was present. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wolfe and Van Wert (2010)</ref> proposed a Multiple-Decision Model (MDM) to account for visual search data based on two factors: (i) the amount of time spent searching an image before concluding a target is not there (the 'quitting threshold') and</p><p>(ii) the amount of evidence above which a target is deemed as present (the response threshold).</p><p>These factors can be affected by target prevalence (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Wolfe et al., 2007)</ref> and by the addition of CAD (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kunar, 2022)</ref>. Our data add to this model by showing that CAD Transparency also affects a person's response threshold above which they are willing to accept a target as present.</p><p>Comparing performance of the CAD conditions to the No CAD control we see mixed results.</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, evidence that performance in the CAD conditions was superior to the No CAD condition was under-whelming. This is particularly true of the Transparent CAD conditions, which showed little difference compared to the No CAD control. One exception was that sensitivity in the Transparent condition, was higher than the No CAD control with a CAD accuracy rate of 83%. However, this did not translate to better performance in the other metrics. In the Not Transparent conditions there was some improvement over the No CAD baseline. However, this mostly occurred when the CAD accuracy rate was lower 3 . Sensitivity was improved in the 83% CAD accuracy condition, but again this did not translate to improvement in other measures. Given that CAD systems in a clinical setting would be expected to show a high degree of accuracy it is interesting that these systems only showed little improvement in performance compared to No CAD conditions. However, given that other research has shown beneficial effects of CAD over No CAD systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Drew et al., 2020)</ref>, future research would be needed to investigate this further.</p><p>One reason why giving people explicit knowledge about CAD accuracy changes their decision outcomes may be because it affects their dependency on those systems. If transparency leads to over-trust in the CAD system, participants would be more likely to accept the CAD recommendation, even if it disagrees with their own judgement (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Felzmann et al., 2020</ref>, for a discussion on the link between transparency and trust in AI). Given that explainable AI (XAI)</p><p>is a complex and difficult field of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Biran &amp; Cotton, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Scharowski et al., 2023</ref>) the above results question whether the need to produce transparent AI is always necessary. Further research needs to be conducted on this but for present purposes our data clearly show that increased transparency about AI accuracy can lead to negative effects.</p><p>Lastly, it may be that participants chose not to use the CAD system if they were informed of its inaccuracy. There is some evidence that this may be the case if we examine <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, which shows differences in metrics at the lower CAD accuracy rates (33% and 67%) across informed of a lower accuracy rate in the Transparent conditions that the CAD systems were being under-used 4 . Given that we did not measure people's perceptions of the CAD systems in these experiments we are unable to determine this here. Nevertheless, this is an important avenue of research for future work.</p><p>The current results are important for medical screening in clinical settings. However, there are differences between lab-based studies and medical screening which need further exploration.</p><p>For example, the prevalence rate of breast cancer would be lower in the clinical setting, and radiologists, of course, have greater expertise than our participants. Furthermore, we operationalised transparency as the level of explicit knowledge available about a system's accuracy. However, there are other factors that affect transparency <ref type="bibr">(Kiseleva et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Future research is needed to examine these factors further. However, for now the data suggest that the regulatory goal of making AI systems more transparent, may not always lead to positive outcomes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Examples of mammogram displays with Correct CAD, Incorrect CAD and No CAD for cancer present trials and Incorrect CAD and No CAD (correct) for cancer absent conditions.
