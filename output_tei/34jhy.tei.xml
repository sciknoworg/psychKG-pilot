			<abstract>
				<p>In a free-choice situation, it is unclear what distinguishes individuals who base their decisions on extrinsically learned values shaped by past reinforcement from those who prioritize intrinsically learned values rooted in personal preferences. This study examined the relationship between these individual differences and long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) using resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Externally learned values are acquired through externally guided decision making (EDM), in which feedback confirms decision accuracy, whereas intrinsically learned values are acquired through internally guided decision making (IDM), based solely on personal preferences without feedback. The participants learned the value of the four stimuli in an EDM task, and subsequently performed an IDM task with these learned stimuli and 11 new stimuli. Resting-state EEG signals were recorded before and after both the tasks. The results indicated that individuals with a higher alpha-range LRTC prioritize intrinsically learned values over externally learned values in the IDM. These findings were discussed in relation to individual differences in alpha wave-gating function and self-specificity of intrinsic brain activity contribute to the prioritization of self-related preferences in free choice.</p>

The SIV phenomenon suggests that when simultaneous comparison of all options is not required, participants can make choices that align with their intrinsic preferences in situations where there are sufficient options and opportunities for making choices, even when influenced by extrinsically learned values. Importantly, SIV does not manifest in all individuals, while its degree varies among participants. One analysis using open data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhu et al. (2024a)</ref> revealed that 23.68% of participants chose HP stimuli more frequently than N1, highlighting the existence of individual differences in the extent to which extrinsically and intrinsically learned values are distinguished. In other words, variations in SIV reflect individual differences in whether extrinsically or intrinsically learned values are prioritized in</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IDM.</head><p>The factors underlying these individual differences in whether people prioritize extrinsically learned values or intrinsically learned values remain poorly understood. One potential factor is the long-range temporal correlation (LRTC) of intrinsic brain activity. The LRTC reflects the slow decay of the autocorrelation in neural activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hardstone et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Poil et al., 2012)</ref>, and arises from a critical brain state. This state is characterized by a balanced condition of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Avramiea et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Poil et al., 2012)</ref>, that optimizes the brain's ability to balance change and stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Avramiea et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bak et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chialvo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Liang et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Linkenkaer-Hansen et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Meisel et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Shew and Plenz, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The relationship between SIV and LRTC can be inferred from the results of previous research, which showed that a higher LRTC was associated with behaviors reflecting both changes and the stability of preferences as intrinsically learned values.</p><p>SIV arises during the process of intrinsic value learning through the CIPC in the IDM (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(b)). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Colosio et al. (2017)</ref> previously reported that participants with a higher alpha-range LRTC exhibited greater CIPC. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Nakao et al. (2019)</ref> showed that participants with higher LRTC demonstrated more autocorrelated choice behavior in the IDM, where stimuli chosen once were more likely to be chosen again.</p><p>This autocorrelated behavior occurs because of CIPC in IDM tasks involving repeated presentations of the same stimulus, and is more clearly observed when the intrinsically learned value is consistently reflected in the IDM without being contaminated by noise, -that is, by influences unrelated to the intrinsically learned value <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Nakao et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Nakao et al., , 2016</ref>. Collectively, these findings indicate that individuals with higher LRTC are more susceptible to value changes through CIPC, and reflect these values more consistently in the IDM because of the reduced influence of noise. Because the intrinsically learned values of new stimuli in the IDM are formed through CIPC, individuals with higher LRTC could be expected to have higher intrinsically learned values for new stimuli, including N1. Moreover, since individuals with higher LRTC are less influenced by noise in IDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Nakao et al., 2019)</ref>, thus, it can be predicted that extrinsically learned values are less reflected in IDM, leading to HP stimuli being chosen less frequently.</p><p>Because SIV arises when N1 is chosen more frequently than HP, individuals with a higher LRTC are expected to exhibit a greater SIV. However, the relationship between LRTC and the balance between extrinsically and intrinsically learned values in IDM has yet to be demonstrated.</p><p>Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Colosio et al. (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Nakao et al. (2019)</ref> explored the relationship between LRTC and CIPC or autocorrelated behavior in IDM, they did not investigate the influence of extrinsically learned values in IDM. Clarifying this relationship will be essential to understand how the brain balances external and internal criteria in everyday decision-making processes.</p><p>The present study aimed to clarify the relationship between LRTC and the balance of two value criteria in the IDM, as reflected by the individual differences in the SIV phenomenon. Specifically, this study tested whether individuals with greater alpha-range LRTC exhibited more SIV, as indicated by a higher N1 value and lower HP value in the IDM. We report the results of the SIV, calculated from the final value at the end of the IDM task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1(b)</ref>), estimated by the computational model implemented with CIPC. The results for the chosen frequency are also provided in the Supplemental Materials. Although the differences in the final value of the stimuli reflect variations in the chosen frequency, the final value is estimated by tracking value changes across trials, taking into account the order of presentation of stimulus pairs. Therefore, the final value serves as a more detailed indicator than the chosen frequency.</p><p>In addition to the SIV, we calculate the ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials of IDM, which involve a combination of old stimuli from EDM and new stimuli for IDM, as an additional index of the balance between intrinsically and extrinsically learned values. We subsequently examined whether a higher LRTC was associated with a higher ratio of new stimuli chosen in the old-new trials.</p><p>We applied the paradigm used in the prior study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhu et al. (2024a)</ref>, in which participants first performed the EDM task, followed by the IDM task (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(c)).</p><p>In contrast to the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhu et al. (2024a)</ref>, we performed electroencephalography (EEG) during the eyes-closed (EC) resting state three times: before the EDM task (EC1), between the EDM and IDM tasks (EC2), and after the IDM task (EC3). EC1, compared to EC2 and EC3, reflects relatively pure intrinsic brain activity, and is unaffected by task-related influences. If the intrinsic brain activity is associated with SIV, we would expect to observe a positive correlation between SIV and EC1. Furthermore, if this intrinsic activity remains consistent before and after decision-making tasks and correlates with SIV, we would expect to observe a common positive correlation across all three resting states. (left) and IDM (right), the influence of EDM on IDM (blue dashed arrow), and the SIV phenomenon (far right). In EDM, the value of a chosen stimulus increases in the presence of a reward feedback, and decreases when feedback is absent. HP stimuli, which have a high reward probability, acquire high extrinsically learned value. The high value is carried over to IDM as the initial value of HP stimuli (blue dashed arrow <ref type="bibr">;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhu et al., 2024a)</ref>. In IDM, the value of a stimulus increases when chosen, and decreases when not (CIPC). Although HP stimuli are selected in IDM due to their high initial value, they are less preferred compared to N1, the most preferred new stimulus. This phenomenon is referred to as SIV <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Zhu et al., 2024a)</ref>. LP represents a stimulus with a low probability of reward in EDM, while N11 denotes the least preferred new stimulus in IDM. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhu et al. (2024a)</ref>, as well as the present study, two sets of four stimuli were used in EDM, and the four stimuli plus 11 new stimuli were used in IDM. This figure only displays the value changes for four stimuli. The values presented are examples estimated using a computational model based on the participants' behavioral data in this study.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participants</head><p>A power test for correlation analysis (statistical power = 0.80, type I error probability = 0.05, effect size = 0.30) was conducted to determine the required sample size. Considering a potential reduction in sample size due to data recording and EEG preprocessing issues, the experiment was conducted in 94 healthy Japanese university students (49 male, 43 female, 2 other; 91 right-handed; mean age = 20.35, age range = 18-31 years). All participants were native speakers of Japanese with either normal or corrected-to-normal vision. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Graduate School of Education at the University of Hiroshima. All participants provided written informed consent prior to study participation, in line with the guidelines set by the Hiroshima University Research Ethics Committee. Participants were compensated for their participation in the study.</p><p>EEG data from five participants and behavioral data from one participant were unavailable due to recording issues. After resting EEG automatized preprocessing, one participant was excluded because of the removal of 19 EEG channels (the mean number of channels removed for the included participants was 0.225), while two others were excluded because they retained fewer than 10 independent components (ICs; the mean retained ICs for the included participants was 21.513). Additionally, four participants excluded from further analysis due to a correct response rate in the EDM task below the mean minus two standard deviations (SD; range was 0.49-0.59), as they were deemed to lack sufficient task engagement and extrinsic value learning in EDM. The correct response rates for the remaining participants ranged from 0.67-1.00. In total, 81 participants were included in the final analysis (40 males, 39 female, two other; 78 right-handed; mean age = 20.37, age range = 18-31).</p></div>

(2024a)</ref>, derived from the novel contour shapes created in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Endo et al. (2003)</ref>, were utilized. These shapes are identified by the numbers <ref type="bibr">29,</ref><ref type="bibr">31,</ref><ref type="bibr">35,</ref><ref type="bibr">36,</ref><ref type="bibr">37,</ref><ref type="bibr">39,</ref><ref type="bibr">42,</ref><ref type="bibr">44,</ref><ref type="bibr">45,</ref><ref type="bibr">56,</ref><ref type="bibr">63,</ref><ref type="bibr">65,</ref><ref type="bibr">81,</ref><ref type="bibr">87</ref>, and 92 in the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Endo et al. (2003)</ref>. The 15 selected stimuli exhibited moderate width (mean = 5.5, SD = 1.8), complexity (mean = 5.1, SD = 1.4), symmetry (mean = 3.7, SD = 1.7), smoothness (mean = 4.6, SD = 1.7), and orientations (mean = 5.0, SD = 2.1), as quantified on a 1 to 9-point rating scale by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Endo et al. (2003)</ref>. Additionally, the shapes showed a relatively low association score (mean = 65.71, SD = 6.84), defined as the percentage of respondents who could not name a particular object, but could describe how it resembled something when asked for the name of the shape <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Endo et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The size of the images was 800 × 600 pixels, while the participants viewed the image pairs at a 30-degree angle of view. PsychoPy software <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Peirce et al., 2019)</ref> running on the Windows 10 operating system was used to present each stimulus pair on a white background on a 1920 × 1080 monitor. The stimuli were presented side-by-side on the left and right sides of the screen.</p><p>The presentation order of the shapes and trial sequences were randomized across participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Task</head><p>All participants first completed the EDM task, followed by the IDM task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1(c)</ref>), to examine SIV, which reflects the influence of extrinsically learned values acquired in EDM on IDM. In the EDM task, which is a reward learning task, four novel contour shapes were randomly selected from 15 shapes, and two shape pairs were randomly created for each participant. Participants completed two blocks of 50 trials, yielding 100 trials in total. Each trial was initiated with the presentation of a fixation cross for a randomly selected duration of 5,000 ms, 5,500 ms, or 6,000 ms.</p><p>These pre-stimulus durations were longer than those employed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhu et al. (2024a)</ref> to explore the relationship between pre-stimulus neural activity complexity and poststimulus trial-to-trial variability of neural activity, as observed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wolff et al., (2019)</ref>, although this was not the subject of the present study. Two shapes were presented on either side of the fixation cross. Stimulus sets and positions were randomized for each trial. Participants were instructed to press the "F" (left) or "J" (right) keys on a standard keyboard to select the shape they believed to be correct, responding as quickly and accurately as possible. Participants received feedback on their choice 1,500 ms after they provided the choice response; this feedback, which indicated whether their response was correct (+1) or incorrect (0), was displayed for 1,000 ms.</p><p>Participants were informed that a result of +1 would earn more points and receive a higher reward after the experiment. Participants were instructed to maximize their rewards during the EDM task. One of the two stimuli had a 90% probability of yielding a reward, whereas the other had a 10% probability. The probability of earning a point for each stimulus was determined independently for each trial, implying that earning a point for one stimulus does not preclude earning a point for another. Before starting the EDM task, participants were informed that each stimulus had a specific probability of earning points; however, the exact probabilities were not disclosed.</p><p>In the preference judgment task (IDM task), pairs were created from all possible combinations of the shapes, including the four shapes from the EDM task (i.e., each stimulus was presented 14 times). Each stimulus pair was presented once.</p><p>Three types of stimuli were used in the IDM task: new (N), high-probability (HP) from the EDM task, and low-probability (LP) from the EDM task. Participants completed three blocks of 35 preference judgment trials and were asked to choose their preferred shape based on their own criteria. They were informed that there were no objectively correct answers for the IDM task. The stimuli were presented in the same manner as in the EDM task; however, no feedback was provided following this choice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Computational model analysis</head><p>To estimate the values of each stimulus on a trial-by-trial basis, including the final values at the end of the task, CIPC-implemented computational models were fitted to the choice behavior data in IDM. The model used in this study, outlined below, is identical to that validated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhu et al. (2024a)</ref>.

Conversely, if item i was rejected, the learning rate was multiplied by − ( ) and added to the value at trial t.</p><p>The initial value for the HP stimulus was estimated as free parameters based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zhu et al.

The initial values of the LP and N stimuli were fixed at 0.5.</p><p>Using this model, the probability of stimulus choice in each trial was calculated from the estimated values of the two stimuli using the softmax function with the free parameter β, which represents the slope of the function (see <ref type="table">Equation 2</ref> in Supplemental Materials).</p><p>Hierarchical Bayesian methods were employed for parameter estimation.

To remove bad channels and non-stationary artifacts, the Artifact Subspace Reconstruction method (ASR; Mullen et al., 2015) was applied using the 'clean_rawdata' (version 2.9.1) EEGLAB plugin. The EEG data were referenced to an average reference. Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to eliminate stationary artifacts (e.g., eye movements). An Adaptive Mixture ICA (AMICA version 1.7; Palmer et al., 2011) was applied to the data of each participant. The equivalent current dipole of each IC was estimated using DIPFIT (version 5.4 EEGLAB plugin, utilizing the Fieldtrip toolbox), and bilateral dipole fitting was performed with the fitTwoDipole EEGLAB plugin (version 1.00; Piazza et al., 2016). IC selection was carried out using the ICLabel (version 1.6) EEGLAB plugin (Pion-Tonachini et al., 2019) with a brain activity probability greater than 70% and residual variance of less than 0.15. The remaining ICs were projected back onto the scalp electrodes to generate artifact-free EEG data.</p><p>The supplementary materials provide further details on the EEG recording and preprocessing procedures.</p></div>

In total, 24 time windows, ranging from 0.1 to 30 seconds, were extracted with a 75% overlap, and each window was linearly detrended using least-squares fitting. The SD of the detrended data was subsequently computed for each time window, and the average SD across all windows of the same size was set as the fluctuation function, F(t). F(t) was plotted on a logarithmic scale for all window sizes, and DFAe (the linear slope of the trend line in the 2 to 16 seconds range) was subsequently calculated, as described in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Meisel et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sugimura et al., 2020</ref>; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S11</ref>).</p><p>Additionally, a surrogate data analysis was conducted to verify whether the observed DFAe results reflected the temporal structure of the phase.

These findings indicate that individuals with higher LRTC are less influenced by extrinsically learned values (represented by the right side of the blue area in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 4</ref>), while simultaneously assigning more intrinsic value to moderately preferred stimuli (represented by the right side of the orange area in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 4</ref>) in IDM.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Potential explanations: Inhibition of task-irrelevant information or selfspecificity of intrinsic brain activity</head><p>It is unclear which underlying processes contribute to the observed reduction in the effect of extrinsically learned values on IDM in participants with higher LRTC in intrinsic brain activity. However, one possible explanation could be derived from the information-gating function of alpha-band oscillations, which inhibits task-irrelevant information <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Klimesch, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Klimesch et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Individuals with a high resting alpha-band LRTC tend to exhibit greater flexibility in switching between tasks, and can adapt quickly to changing task demands, indicating a superior ability to inhibit task-irrelevant information <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Golemme et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Mahjoory et al., 2019)</ref>. The distinction between the EDM and IDM lies in their respective task demands-decisions based on externally provided value criteria versus self-determined value criteria. Thus, according to the gating function of the alpha band, individuals with higher LRTC may inhibit judgments based on extrinsically learned values when HP stimuli are presented in the IDM task. Conversely, individuals with lower LRTC may struggle to inhibit the influence of easily accessible extrinsically learned values, thereby resulting in insufficient switching between EDM and IDM task demands. Thus, in this context, SIV is thought to reflect the extent to which internally learned values are distinguished from externally learned values in IDM.</p><p>Another possible explanation is that self-specificity is a fundamental feature of the intrinsic brain activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Northoff, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zhang et al., 2023)</ref>; this perspective posits that the self is embedded in and continuously maintained by intrinsic brain activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Northoff, 2016)</ref>, which is closely related to the efficient processing of self-relevant stimuli, known as the self-prioritization effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Zhang et al., 2023)</ref>. Additionally, research has indicated a relationship between LRTC and self-related traits, with higher LRTC associated with greater private self-consciousness <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Huang et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Wolff et al., 2018)</ref> and lower identity confusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Sugimura et al., 2020)</ref>. Stimuli repeatedly chosen based on personal preferences, rather than rewards provided by the external environment, are likely to increase self-relevance. In other words, a higher intrinsically learned value indicates a higher degree of self-relevance. Consequently, participants with higher LRTC may process self-relevant stimuli more efficiently, and consistently reflect intrinsically learned values in their decision-making, while being less influenced by extrinsically learned values in IDM. Thus, in this context, SIV is understood to reflect the extent to which intrinsically learned values are prioritized in decision-making.</p><p>Currently, which of these two explanations better accounts for the observed relationship between LRTC and the balance of extrinsically and intrinsically learned values in IDM remains unclear. However, this question could be addressed by measuring the extent to which intrinsically learned values affect the EDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Zhu et al., 2024b</ref>) and examining their relationship with the LRTC. If a higher LRTC corresponds to a reduced influence of IDM-learned values on the EDM, it would suggest that individuals with a high LRTC can clearly distinguish between the two value systems by inhibiting task-irrelevant information. However, if intrinsically learned values play a stronger role in the EDM for individuals with a higher LRTC, this suggests that these individuals are more likely to prioritize self-relevant information in their decisionmaking. Further research is required to determine which explanation is more appropriate, or whether other processes better explain the distinction between the two value systems and their relationship with LRTC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Limitations</head><p>This study has several limitations. Firstly, although the mean SIV and the mean ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials across participants confirmed that both extrinsically and intrinsically learned values are referenced in IDM <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2</ref> (b)(c)(d)),</p><p>individual differences in these indices may not be solely driven by the balance between the extrinsically and intrinsically learned values. That is, variations in participants' preferences for the shapes of the HP1 (and HP2) stimuli may be contaminated by the individual differences observed in these indices. Given the significant correlations of intrinsic brain activity with SIV, HP1 final value, and the ratio of new stimuli, it is unlikely that chance preference alone would explain the individual differences in these balance indices. However, this confounding factor may have weakened the correlation.</p><p>Therefore, developing methods to control for this variable will be essential for future research.</p><p>Secondly, this study found that individuals with high LRTC were less influenced by extrinsically learned values in IDM, as indicated by their reduced likelihood of choosing HP stimuli. However, the results further showed a stronger preference for moderately preferred stimuli, such as N7, suggesting more frequent selection in the IDM. Due to the nature of the experimental paradigm used, it is difficult to discern whether the inhibition of extrinsically learned values or the dominance of moderately preferred values is more closely associated with LRTC.</p><p>Finally, the reinforcement of intrinsically learned values in the present study remains unclear. CIPC is associated with activity in reward-related brain regions,</p><p>including the striatum <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Izuma et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Jarcho et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kitayama et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Nakao et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Schonberg and Katz, 2020)</ref>. Prior studies have commonly used stimuli likely to induce rewarding activities, such as food, whereas the stimuli in this study were novel contour shapes. It is challenging to assert that selecting simple shapes activates reward-related brain areas in the same way as food. It is known that novel stimuli were preferred <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Sehl et al., 2022)</ref>, and hence the novelty effect may have contributed to the intrinsically learned value correlated with LRTC in this study.</p><p>However, there was no evidence that new stimuli were preferred over old <ref type="bibr">(HP and LP)</ref> stimuli on average, and that new stimuli were chosen less frequently than old ones in old-new trials <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2 (d)</ref>). Additionally, Simulation 3 in the Supplementary Material indicates that the novelty effect was insufficient to explain the SIV in the current data.</p><p>The reinforcement of intrinsically learned values in preference judgments of simple</p><p>shapes remains an open question for future investigation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In summary, in the present study, we found that in the IDM, individuals with higher LRTC were less likely to prefer stimuli associated with a high probability of reward in the EDM, and were more likely to prefer new stimuli whose values were learned purely intrinsically. In other words, individuals with lower LRTC were more inclined to base their decisions on external criteria learned through rewards in the EDM, while those with higher LRTC tended to rely more on internal criteria. The reasons for the association between the LRTC and individual differences in the value criteria referenced in the IDM remain unclear. Two possibilities may be considered: firstly, individuals with a high alpha-band LRTC may possess a heightened ability to suppress task-irrelevant information, thereby enabling them to adapt their value criteria based on task demands in the EDM and IDM, and individuals with high LRTC may prioritize self-relevant information, such as intrinsically learned values, in their decision-making.</p><p>These possibilities require further investigation. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>(a) Diagram summarizing the names of the two decision-making tasks, the referenced value criteria for each, the learning of values that arise, and the learned values.

To confirm the replication of the SIV using the estimated final values, we compared the final values in the IDM for three stimuli: N1, HP1, and HP2 (Figure 2(b)). Multiple comparisons revealed that the mean value of N1 (M = 0.788, SD = 0.071) was significantly higher than that of HP1 (M = 0.653, SD = 0.208; t(80) = 5.048, one-tailed pHolm &lt; 0.001, d = 0.561, 95% lower CL of d = 0.363) and HP2 (M = 0.489, SD = 0.219; t(80) = 10.657, one-tailed pHolm &lt; 0.001, d = 1.184, 95% lower CL of d = 0.942). These results replicated the SIV indexed by the estimated final values in this study. The statistics (t, p, d values, and 95% CIs of d) are presented in</figDesc></figure>

This skewness improved after the inverse transformation(old-old, 0.197; old-new, −0.376; new-new, −0.137).Multiple comparisons revealed that the RTs for old-new(M = 1946(M =  .881 ms, SD =    1704 t(80)  = 2.817, pHolm = 0.012, d = 0.313, 95% CI of d = 0.089, 0.535) and new-new trials (M = 1884.602 ms, SD = 1477.942; t(80) = 2.976, pHolm = 0.012, d = 0.331, 95% CI of d = 0.106, 0.553) were significantly longer than those for old-old trials (M = 1728.389 ms, SD = 1262.045). Conversely, no significant difference was found between old-new and new-new trials (t(80) = 0.752, pHolm = 0.454, d = 0.084, 95% CI of d = −0.135, 0.301). Combined with the finding that the mean chosen frequency of HP stimuli (M = 0.570, SD = 0.220; t(80) = 2.859, pHolm = 0.005, d = 0.318, 95% CI of d = 0.093, 0.540) was higher than that of LP stimuli (M = 0.430, SD = 0.220) in old-old trials, the shorter RTs in the old-old trials indicate that the values learned in EDM influenced IDM. In summary, the analysis of the ratio of new stimuli chosen in old-new trials confirmed that both extrinsically and intrinsically learned values influenced IDM. The RT analysis across the three trial types (old-old, old-new, and new-new) further demonstrated that extrinsically learned values were influenced IDM.</figDesc></figure>

The channel-averaged DFAe values for EC1, EC2, and EC3 were 0.771 (SD = 0.117), 0.812 (SD = 0.121), and 0.834 (SD = 0.118), respectively. Previous studies using large sample sizes have reported alpha-band DFA indices in adults ranging from 0.55 to just below 1.10 (Smit et al., 2011), which is consistent with the present study. Plots of the scalp channel-averaged fluctuation function (F(t)) are presented inFigure S11of the Supplemental Materials. To assess the reliability of the DFAe, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC (2, k)) Shrout &amp; Fleiss, 1979) was calculated for EC1, EC2, and EC3. The ICC for channel-averaged DFAe was deemed to be acceptable (ICC(2,3) = 0.849, 95%CI = 0.754-0.905). Oneway repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to compare the DFAe across the three EC resting states, revealing significant differences between the three conditions (F(2,160) = 19.181, p &lt; 0.001, ηp 2 = 0.193). Post hoc comparisons using the Holm method further showed significant differences across the three conditions (pHolm &lt; 0.039).</figDesc></figure>
