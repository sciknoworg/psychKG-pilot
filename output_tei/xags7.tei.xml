				<p>The current research examined whether carriers of the short 5-HTTLPR allele (in SLC6A4), who have been shown to selectively attend to negative information, exhibit a bias towards negative self-referent processing. The self-referent encoding task (SRET) was used to measure self-referential processing of positive and negative adjectives. Ratcliff&apos;s diffusion model isolated and extracted decision-making components from SRET responses and reaction times. Across the initial (N = 183) and replication (N = 137) studies, results indicated that short 5-HTTLPR allele carriers more easily categorized negative adjectives as self-referential (i.e., higher drift rate). Further, drift rate was associated with recall of negative self-referential stimuli. Findings across both studies provide further evidence that genetic variation may contribute to the etiology of negatively biased processing of self-referent information. Large scale studies examining the genetic contributions to negative self-referent processing may be warranted.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Negatively biased information processing is known to be a risk factor for the development of future depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Negatively biased self-referent processing, in particular, has been shown to be strongly associated with depression risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>and is a central feature of contemporary cognitive models of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</p><p>How one views the self is referred to as a cognitive schema-a representation of one's past experiences that helps guide future categorization of self-referent information <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Cognitive schemas have been hypothesized to strongly influence the processing of incoming stimuli and can therefore influence whether positive or negative concepts are viewed as self-relevant <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. An example of such processing includes easily associating negative terms (e.g., "useless") with the self or, in contrast, difficulty associating positive terms (e.g., "lovable") with the self. Further, negative schemas not only influence processing of incoming information, but they can also negatively bias other cognitive processes, such as recall of information. Thus, cognitive schemas and the processing of self-relevant information play an important role in the development of negative cognitive biases that, in turn, putatively confer risk for depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>In his theoretical work, Beck has speculated that genetic factors may contribute to the development of negative cognitive schemas and biased self-referent processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. One candidate gene that has been repeatedly linked to negative emotion-related phenotypes is the serotonin transporter <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) contributes to the active clearance of extracellular serotonin and appears to be influenced by a polymorphism in the proximal promoter region of the 5-HTT gene (i.e., the 5-HTT linked polymorphic region, or 5-HTTLPR; for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). The 5-HTTLPR is most commonly represented by two variants: a short (S) allele and a long (L) allele, although 5-HTTLPR expression may be influenced by an additional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), namely, rs25531, which is composed of an adenine to guanine change at the sixth nucleotide in the first of two extra 20-to 23-base-pair repeats of the L allele <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The L allele with guanine at the sixth nucleotide (L G ) and the S allele are similar in terms of transcriptional activity; therefore, only the L allele with adenine at the sixth nucleotide (L A ) is associated with relatively increased transcriptional activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. For the sake of brevity, we refer to the LG and S alleles as S and the LA allele as L throughout this article.</p><p>Past work has demonstrated that 5-HTTLPR variation is associated with other related cognitive biases, such as negatively biased attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> and selective attention to negative stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. A meta-analysis of ten studies (N = 807) found that carriers of the low expression variants of the 5-HTTLPR (SS, SL G , and L G L G ) were more likely to display biased attention towards negative stimuli than high expression 5-HTTLPR genotypes (L A homozygotes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). Differences in selective attention between 5-HTTLPR genotype groups were in the medium effect size range (which is very likely to be large over estimate of the true genetic effect).</p><p>More relevant to self-referential processing, prior work in a small sample of children found that S homozygotes recalled more negative words that were rated as self-descriptive following a negative mood induction than the other two genotype groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Even though it is now abundantly clear that complex traits, such as negative self-referential processing, are polygenic phenotypes (the so-called "fourth law" of behavioral genetics <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>), variation in the 5-HTTLPR appears to be somewhat consistently associated with negatively biased information processing. Thus, the 5-HTTLPR appears to be a reasonable genetic candidate to examine in the context of negative self-referential processing, with the caveat that it will only provide a very tentative and incomplete glimpse into the genetic architecture of self-referent processing of negative information.</p><p>The self-referent encoding task (SRET) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> is often used to measure self-referent processing. The SRET is a two-choice, affective decision-making task that is typically paired with incidental recall of the presented stimuli. It involves participants making categorical decisions as to whether or not trait adjectives are self-descriptive. After a waiting period, participants are then asked to recall the adjectives presented during the SRET. Typically, depressed individuals endorse more negative adjectives as self-referential than non-depressed individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. This bias in self-referential processing is also present in individuals who have remitted depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, suggesting that negative cognitive biases persist even when symptoms are no longer evident. Furthermore, prior work has suggested that children at high-risk for depression display more negative processing on the SRET <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, suggesting that negative cognitive schemas predate the onset of depression.</p><p>Past research with the SRET has used the number of negative self-referent adjectives recalled as a proxy for negative self-schema (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>). In the current study, we collected incidental recall but also supplemented it with a measure of decision-making bias by utilizing the diffusion model to analyze the reaction time and endorsement data ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>; for its use in clinical research, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>). The diffusion model deconstructs reaction time for two-choice decision tasks into components that capture the encoding, decision-making, and motor response processes. Thus, a strong benefit of this approach is the ability to isolate and extract decision-making bias from non-decisional components (such as motor response) contained within reaction time responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</p><p>The diffusion model assumes that information is accumulated over the course of decision-making until a decision is reached <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 1)</ref> and that individuals differ in how efficiently people arrive at a decision. In diffusion model terms, drift rate is a parameter that quantifies the rate at which information is accumulated until a decision has been reached. Applied to the current study, drift rate provides a measure of the ease by which participants categorize each word as self-referential or non-self-referential. Drift rate can thereby be conceptualized as a measure of schema strength. For example, a positive drift rate (i.e., greater than 0) suggests that words are categorized as self-referent. The more positive the value, the easier it was for participants to decide that words were self-referent (a steeper positive slope in the left side of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 1)</ref>. A negative drift rate (i.e., less than 0) suggests that words are categorized as not self-referent. The more negative the value, the easier it was for participants to decide that words were not self-referent (a steeper negative slope in the right side of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 1)</ref>. Therefore, a drift rate for negative words that approaches or exceeds zero would be indicative of a strong negative schema, as this would indicate difficulty classifying negative words as not self-referent. Past research has shown strong connections between drift rate and depressive self-referent cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Although other components of the diffusion model are also associated with self-referent cognition (e.g., the relative starting point, thought of as indicating a priori bias in decision-making), they have not been as strongly associated with the negative self-referent processing that occurs in depression.</p><p>Given prior work documenting associations between the 5-HTTLPR and negatively biased processing, we hypothesized that carriers of the short allele would exhibit stronger self-referent processing biases for negative information-that is, they would more easily categorize negative adjectives as self-referential resulting in a larger (less negative) drift rate than individuals homozygous for the long 5-HTTLPR allele. We further hypothesized that negative self-referent processing would be associated with memory bias, such that a larger drift rate for negative words would be associated with greater recall of self-referential negative words.</p><p>Finally, given that the candidate gene literature is rife with non-replications <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, two studies were conducted: an initial study to test the main hypothesis, and, once a genetic association was observed, a replication study. Although a single, large study involving tens or hundreds of thousands of participants that allows for genome-wide testing would be ideal, demonstrating that a candidate genetic variant effect replicates in a second independent study is considered to be an important step towards reducing the likelihood of false positives in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Therefore, in the current work, Study 1 provides an initial test of the association between the 5-HTTLPR and self-referent processing, and Study 2 examined whether such an association could be replicated.  Illustration of the diffusion model. The two schematics shown here represent a subset of trials selected from hypothetical results for two conditions. The left image displays a moderate, self-referential drift rate (i.e. positive slope, low absolute value), and the right image displays a strong, non-self-referential drift rate (i.e. negative slope, high absolute value). Overall SRET reaction time is broken down into three components: encoding period, decision phase, and motor response. During the decision phase, evidence accumulation begins at the relative starting point (which varies across subjects) and continues until one of the thresholds is met. The time taken to reach the threshold across all trials is used to determine drift rate. Two drift rates were generated for each individual, one pertaining to decision making for positive adjectives and one for negative adjectives. and newspaper advertisements. Participants were predominantly white (n = 111), Asian (n = 35), and Black (n = 7); those who did not provide racial background or identified as multiracial made up the remainder (n = 30). As a partial control for the risk of population stratification, we repeated analyses incorporating the 5-HTTLPR gene with only the white sample but did not see a substantively different pattern of results (see last section of Study 1 results). Twenty percent of participants (n = 36) across racial groups defined themselves as Hispanic.</p></div>

Given a two-tailed test with a significance level of .05, this study would achieve a power of 8.2%. This unfortunately is typical of candidate polymorphism studies, which are generally underpowered.

Participants were asked to decide as quickly as possible whether or not the word was self-descriptive. Trials were dropped if participants responded in fewer than 200ms, suggesting inattention or anticipatory guessing; an average of fewer than three trials were dropped, with no more than 10 total trials dropped for any individual participant. Following completion of a nonverbal decision task unrelated to the current study (i.e., a delay of 5-10 minutes), participants were then surprised with a recall task and given five minutes to recall as many of the SRET adjectives as possible. Primary outcomes were the drift rate for positive and negative adjectives identified by the diffusion model (discussed below) and number of self-referent word stimuli recalled.</p><p>Studies have shown that components of the SRET are reliably associated with depression symptomatology <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Ratcliff's diffusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> was used to enhance the interpretability of the SRET reaction time data. The diffusion model is a sequential sampling technique designed to deconstruct reaction time for two-choice decision tasks into cognitive processing components separate from non-decision processes such as encoding and motor response <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. The diffusion model assumes that, within each trial, decisions are formed through the accumulation of evidence until one of two response criteria has been met (e.g., for the SRET, whether a stimulus is self-referential or not self-referential). Once the threshold for that criterion has been met, the decision process concludes and a response is initiated. The diffusion model yields several parameters that describe characteristics of participant response. These include drift rate, relative starting point, threshold separation, response time constant, and differences in speed of response execution <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Of the diffusion model parameters, drift rate is most germane to the SRET, since it putatively measures the rate of evidence accumulation that leads to a decision about whether a stimulus is self-referent or not. For the SRET, a positive drift rate (i.e., drift &gt; 0) reflects evidence accumulation that leads to endorsing the stimulus as self-referential, whereas a negative drift rate (i.e., drift &lt; 0) reflects evidence accumulation that leads to rejecting the stimulus as self-referential (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig 1)</ref>. The absolute value of drift rate reflects the efficiency of evidence accumulation, with larger absolute values reflecting a more efficient decision-making process. For example, a drift rate of 2 reflects more efficient endorsing of self-reference compared to drift rate of 1, while a drift rate of -2 reflects more efficient rejection of self-reference compared to a drift rate of -1. Negative and positive schema strength are operationalized as the drift rate for negative and positive adjectives, respectively. For people with a bias towards negative self-referent processing, we would expect a larger drift rate for negative adjectives (that is, they should inefficiently reject negative adjectives as self-descriptive or more efficiently endorse negative adjectives as self-descriptive). In contrast, for people with a bias towards positive self-referent processing, we would expect a smaller (more negative) drift rate, as they should efficiently endorse negative adjectives as not self-referent.</p><p>Fast-dm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>, a free software program, was used to implement the diffusion model. We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov fitting method for optimizing parameters of the model, as suggested by Voss, Nagler, and Lerche <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. This method is more robust in the presence of outliers, while still being effective at estimating stable parameters without requiring a large number of trials. Although other estimation methods have been suggested for use with small numbers of trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41]</ref>, past work has shown that the Kolmogorv-Smirnov estimation method achieves good results in the SRET <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and that drift rates achieved using this estimation are strongly associated with depressive symptomatology <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. (We include analyses with drift rates estimated by maximum likelihood methods in supplemental materials, S2.) Drift rate was estimated for positive and negative words trials separately. Following estimation, participants were excluded if their drift rates were above the median by more than four of a measure referred to as the double median absolute deviation (double MAD), a standard procedure intended to remove only extreme outliers. (One participant was dropped from this exclusion in Study 1, and six in <ref type="bibr">Study 2.)</ref> We used the package lme4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> and MASS <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[43]</ref> to fit statistical models in R (Version 3.4.3). As primary models involved repeated measure effects (positive and negative post-print updated with DOI June 2018 6/21 outcomes within participants), we used mixed effects linear models, with random intercepts of participant. Where p-values were reported, we compared nested models without the interaction, using likelihood ratio tests. Visualizations were created using ggplot2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>. Outliers were excluded before analysis as described above.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Each participant was first screened for eligibility, and provided written informed consent to participate in the study. They took part individually, in a laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin, on a PC using E-Prime 2.0 (Psychology Software Tools) software to present stimuli and record reaction time data. Participants then provided saliva for genotyping under the direction of the experimenter. Upon completion of this and several tasks designed to measure cognitive functioning, not included in this report, participants were paid $8 per hour for their participation in the study. All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional review board at the University of Texas at Austin and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Association between 5-HTTLPR and drift rate</head><p>Preliminary analyses first examined whether the short allele (S : S and/or L G ) homozygotes and heterozygotes did not differ from each other and therefore could be considered as a single genotype group (S -carriers). A mixed effects regression analysis examined the association between 5-HTTLPR genotype (S S and L A S only), stimuli valence (negative and positive), and the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and stimuli valence for the prediction of drift rate. The 5-HTTLPR × stimulus valence interaction was not significant, β = 0.23, 95% CI [-0.36, 0.81], t = 0.77, p = .44, indicating no significant differences between the S homozygotes and heterozygotes. As such, an S -carrier group was formed and compared to an L A L A group for remaining analyses. The same analysis was carried out in all subjects examining the association between 5-HTTLPR genotype (L A L A vs. S -carriers), stimuli valence (negative and positive), and the interaction between 5-HTTLPR and stimuli valence. The resultant model's R 2 was .73, which had an R 2 .003 better than the model without the interaction. The 5-HTTLPR × stimulus valence interaction neared significant, β = −0.63, 95% CI [-1.28, 0.02], t = −1.89, p = .06 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig 2 a)</ref>. For positive stimuli, contrasts of marginal linear predictions indicated that L A L A and S -carriers did not differ in drift rate, t(180) = −0.72, p = .47, Cohen's d = 0.14, 95% CI [-0.24, 0.52].

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Following completion and analysis of data from Study 1, an additional 137 participants were recruited through fliers and online advertisements from the Austin community to participate in a replication study (78 female, 52 male; age M = 23.0, SD = 4.5). To avoid confounding results due to differing proportions of 5-HTTLPR variation across a racially diverse sample, all participants in this replication study were white. Thirty-five identified as Hispanic or Latino. As in Study 1, participants were screened using the MINI over the phone, and did not meet criteria for any current mental illness or past MDD. All participants had CESD &lt; 16 at the time of participation. Only participants for whom genotyping succeeded were included in analyses. Following genotyping, we conducted a power analysis to determine what power might result given a true effect size of Cohen's d = 0.1, i.e., a small effect, and uneven groups (i.e., 26 participants with two L A alleles and 111 with other genotypes). Given a two-tailed test with a significance level of .05, this study would achieve a power of 7.4%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants completed the CESD and SRET as described in <ref type="bibr">Study</ref>  , with no participants losing more than 10 trials. Two salivary DNA collection methods were used in this study. For the first 75 participants, the same collection methods were used as described above. For the remaining sample, participants were asked to rub the inside of their cheeks and gums with cotton-tipped swabs, for 30s each, three times. The three swabs were stored in a 50ml tube containing the same lysis buffer as described in the previous collection method. Following swabbing, participants were asked to swish 10ml of distilled water in their mouths for 20s and then to expectorate into the tube. All tubes were stored in a locked refrigerator at 4°C until ready for extraction, where genomic DNA was extracted from buccal cells and saliva. All procedures were otherwise identical. Genotyping was carried out in the same laboratory. Results of an exact test for Hardy Weinberg proportions found no statistically significant deviation from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium in the sample (p = .06; L A L A = 26; L A L G = 9; L A S = 58; L G L G = 1; L G S = 9; SS = 34).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study investigated the relationship between genetic variation in the serotonin transporter gene and negative self-referent processing. Findings from this study provide evidence that the presence of the short allele of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism is associated with increased negative self-referent processing. Short 5-HTTLPR allele carriers had a larger drift rate for negative words, indicating greater difficulty categorizing negative words as not self-referential compared to long allele homozygotes. Drift rate for categorizing negative words, in turn, was associated with increased recall of self-referential negative stimuli. However, the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism did not moderate the connection between drift rate and memory bias for negative or positive stimuli.</p><p>Although findings from Study 1 were intriguing, we sought to determine whether the association between 5-HTTLPR variation and drift rate for negative stimuli observed in Study 1 could be replicated. Replication is particularly important in this area of research, as many initially observed candidate gene effects have not been subsequently replicated, casting doubt on the reliability of initial genetic discoveries <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[45]</ref>. Further, given that population stratification (i.e., presence of allele frequency differences between different subpopulations) and analytic flexibility can contribute to false discoveries <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, for the replication study we recruited a racially homogenous sample, implemented the identical research protocol, and followed an identical analytic plan using the same analysis scripts as in Study 1.</p><p>Results from the replication study were largely consistent with the initial study, and this consistency is demonstrated in the results for the combined samples reported below the replication. Most notably, we replicated a significant interaction between SRET stimulus valence and 5-HTTLPR genotype. As in Study 1, the S carrier group had a larger drift rate for negative stimuli compared to the L A L A group and no genotype differences in drift rate were observed for positive stimuli. The genotype effect size for differences in drift rate for negative words in Study 1 was smaller (Cohen's d = .38) than in Study 2 (Cohen's d = .48), but both trends were in the same direction. Nevertheless, the effect size for the genetic effect in these studies is small, as indicated by the marginal increases in percentage variance explained by the addition of the interaction term in regressions; this is reasonable, as the true genetic contribution of a single genetic variant is likely to be a small portion of variance explained for a putatively polygenic complex trait like negative self-referential processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. If the study sample sizes were much larger (N s in the thousands), we would predict that the 5-HTTLPR effect size for its association with drift rate would be more representative of the true effect size.</p><p>Nevertheless, the current findings provide further evidence for the connection between 5-HTTLPR variation and biased processing of negative information. An interesting literature is emerging which appears to link the 5-HTTLPR to a range of negative cognitive biases (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[48]</ref>, although one should keep in mind that publication bias is likely influencing this literature and meta-analyses likely overestimate the true association between the 5-HTTLPR and negative information processing biases. However, it is important to note that the 5-HTTLPR was not globally associated with negative cognitive bias in the current study, as there was no direct link with biased memory for affective stimuli in either study. These findings suggest that the 5-HTTLPR genotype may increase risk for depression by influencing how negative information about the self is processed. Such a bias, in turn, may facilitate how negative information is recalled, and work in concert with other factors to increase cognitive vulnerability to depression.</p><p>Although the current study found a genetic association with negative self-referent processing, it remains unclear to what degree negative cognitive biases are influenced by genetic variation. Because the heritability of these cognitive phenotypes is not known, it is unclear to what extent these small effect findings, such as the ones observed in the current studies, account for the cumulative genetic influence. Genetically informed studies using twin methodology indicate moderate heritability for self-reported negative cognitive biases, such as rumination <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref> and attributional style <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>. There is also evidence from twin studies for a strong genetic contribution to basic cognitive processes that likely underlie negative cognitive bias, such as executive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref> and memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>.</p><p>In addition to twin studies, estimates of genetic contribution can also be obtained from unrelated individuals when genomewide genetic variation is measured directly. This approach, commonly known as SNP heritability, provides an estimate of how much variance in a phenotype can be explained by measured genetic variation. A large project recently examined the genetic basis of 17 intermediate psychophysiological phenotypes for psychiatric disorder in a general population sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>. Several of the phenotypes demonstrated moderate or greater SNP heritability (e.g., antisaccade eye tracking error, overall startle amplitude, P3 amplitude, alpha frequency), but several did not <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">57]</ref>. We believe it would be enormously helpful to conduct similar studies on a larger scale with negative cognitive bias phenotypes, as such work would provide critical direction regarding which phenotypes for depression should be further examined for their genetic basis and which ones should not be pursued. However, no such study has been completed despite the strong research base supporting the role of negative cognitive bias in depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>A notable feature of the current study was the use of the diffusion model to operationalize the decision-making component of self-referent processing. Such computational models provide an ability to access the decisional processes that are conceptualized to be the basis of schematic systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Precise measurements of cognitive phenomena are vital in order to find generalizable and reproducible results. Measurement error reduces precision in parameter estimates, which can be particularly problematic for small N studies and when hypothesized effects are expected to be relatively modest, as in many candidate gene studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>. Thus, while it is very important to use negative cognitive bias tasks with robust psychometric properties in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[59]</ref>, this may be especially true for genetic association studies. Computational modeling of key cognitive processes may help with this and future research in this area should try to incorporate these approaches whenever possible.</p><p>There are several limitations to this research that are worth noting. First and most importantly, while we did include a replication study, both studies were underpowered-if the true effect were in fact quite small, we would have been relatively unlikely to find it with these sample sizes. Given the number of false positives that have been observed in psychiatric genetics, we would be more confident in our findings if we had demonstrated the observed association between 5-HTTLPR and negative self-referent processing in two large studies with thousands of participants-indeed, we would need at least 8,500 participants to collect data from sufficient numbers of L A L A participants to achieve 80% power. We believe that this preliminary study supports the inclusion of self-referential processing as a phenotype in future large-scale genetic analysis of cognitive biases. However, as in other studies investigating candidate genes, there are likely other unmeasured variables that contribute to the putative genetic post-print updated with DOI June 2018</p><p>15/21 association, including variance in the linkage disequilibrium of measured variants with unmeasured variants, population stratification, and others. We also recognize that a significant limitation of this report is that we conducted multiple tests in these analyses, such that some of our statistical tests would not withstand a correction for multiple comparisons. There is also a possibility that 5-HTTLPR polymorphic variations are associated with the decreased depressive symptoms used as an entry criterion for this study; we cannot be certain without recruiting a depressed sample.</p><p>Although we tried to account for several confounding factors, such as current or past psychopathology, depression symptom severity, and race (in Study 2), this is ultimately a correlational study and the association between 5-HTTLPR variation and self-referent processing is also vulnerable to other, non-genetic, third variable explanations. Related to this point, the current study used a sample of healthy individuals, which is a common approach in this area of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[60]</ref>. Nevertheless, it will be important to conduct similar research in clinical samples to determine whether these results generalize to people who are currently depressed.</p><p>Future research that uses the diffusion model with the SRET may consider adding trials to the existing task structure. The diffusion model converged for all participants in the study with acceptable model fit; however, diffusion model parameters typically have greater precision as number of task trials increases (e.g., 200 trials; for more detail, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>). Further, some studies have used the self-referent encoding task only after priming participants with a sad mood induction <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. A sad mood induction may potentially enhance negative self-referent processing in vulnerable populations; future work examining the contribution of genetic variation to self-referent processing may consider such mood manipulations.</p><p>Nevertheless, the current study provides new evidence that genetic factors may contribute to the etiology of negative self-referent processing, suggests a new approach to measuring negative self-referent processing using the well-established SRET task, and further reinforces the fruitful synergy that can emerge from combining cognitive and genetic models of psychopathology (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref>). We believe studying depression vulnerability across levels of analysis (e.g., genetic, cognitive, behavioral, environmental) will foster the development of comprehensive models of depression vulnerability and may ultimately help us to better understand the etiology of this pernicious disorder.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>MethodsParticipantsOne hundred and eighty-three participants aged 18-35 (106 female, 77 male; age M = 25.1, SD = 4.3) were recruited from the greater Austin community through fliers</figDesc></figure>
