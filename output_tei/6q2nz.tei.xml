			<abstract>
				<p>The vestibular system is primarily associated with functions like stabilizing the retinal image, balance, and spatial orientation, but evidence suggests that vestibular information might also modulate cognitive functions such as general decision-making. Using galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), behavioral modulations have been shown to depend on the stimulation polarity, consequently challenging an established view of vestibular processing. The current study aimed to replicate and extend the findings of De Maio and colleagues (2021), in which a polarity-specific GVS effect was reported in the context of risk-taking. GVS was delivered with different polarity configurations (leftanodal/right-cathodal, right-anodal/left-anodal) to 37 participants while they performed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) of the original study and an additional risk-taking task (Game of Dice Task). Polarity-specific effects were absent in both tasks. Our results indicate that the polarity-specific effects observed in the original study are likely caused by order effects and small samples rather than the vestibular stimulation.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The vestibular system is most generally associated with the vestibular organs located in the inner ear, namely the semicircular canals and the otoliths. With the semicircular canals sensing rotational head movement and the otoliths sensing linear vertical and horizontal motion, both organs provide the brain with important information for essential functions like balance and spatial orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. However, vestibular information is processed across multiple levels within the brain, including an extensive network in the cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>While cortical integration of vestibular information is still poorly understood, it has gained some additional interest in recent years, partly due to potential interactions between such information and higher-order brain functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. More specifically, recent findings point to the possibility that vestibular information might not only modulate functions in the realm of perception, but also cognition and behaviour more generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Many of these findings emerged using a non-invasive, vestibular stimulation technique called galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), which modulates the firing rate of the vestibular nerve by applying a low-intensity electrical current through an anode and a cathode placed on the mastoid <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, several studies investigating these modulations found them to be dependent on the position of the anode and cathode, i.e. the polarity of the stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. For example, De Maio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> administered GVS with different polarity configurations while participants performed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task <ref type="bibr">[BART ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. They found that the propensity to take risks was reduced in the left-anodal/right-cathodal stimulation condition (L-GVS) compared to a configuration with inverted polarity, i.e. in the right-anodal/left-cathodal stimulation condition (R-GVS). In line with previous studies, De Maio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> suggest that such polarity-specific effects might result from lateralized activation patterns and hemispheric dominance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. More specifically, L-GVS seems to mainly activate the right cerebral hemisphere, while R-GVS leads to a more balanced activation between the two hemispheres <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Polarity-specific effects might consequently emerge by modulating the activity of specific brain areas associated with certain behavioural tasks. In the case of the BART, polarity-specific vestibular information might influence risktaking by specifically modulating the activity of the right anterior cingulate cortex and insula, which are involved in risky decisions during this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</p><p>However, despite the empirical evidence advocating for polarity-specific vestibular effects, the proposed neural mechanisms pose some questions. Most notably, polarity-specific vestibular effects are hard to reconcile with the current understanding of how GVS is processed by the brain. Research strongly indicates that vestibular information from the two peripheral vestibular end-organs is combined in a push-pull-like fashion at the level of the vestibular nuclei before ascending to the cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>. In this context, vestibular information entering the cortex is unlikely to differ between L-GVS and R-GVS, because polarityspecific information might already be lost at the level of the vestibular nuclei.</p><p>Additionally, vestibular and cognitive functions are assumed to be inter-connected in this model, but the extent of the neuroanatomical and functional overlap between the two is still a matter of debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. For example, while risktaking is generally associated with the anterior insula, vestibular processing is generally much more associated with the posterior insula <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> or the parietal opercular (OP2) region <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>. It remains unclear if and how these two functions interact. This potential interaction is also complicated by the fact that GVS does not exclusively act on the vestibular nerve, but is known to have confounding effects such as the activation of autonomic brain areas, which in turn can modulate cognition and behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</p><p>In this current preregistered study, we attempted to replicate and extend the findings by De Maio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> following the three aims below: Firstly, we attempted to replicate the findings of the study by using a highly similar experimental procedure and task, but relying on a bigger sample size based on an a priori power analysis and a balanced within-subjects design.</p><p>Secondly, we also attempted to gain further information about the nature of the polarity-specific vestibular effect by using an additional set of statistical tools. More specifically, we used equivalence testing to obtain information on the true effect size <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Using such a procedure seems important not only because the originally specified effect size seems rather large (d = 0.548), but also because little is known about the true effect size of such effects in general.</p><p>Lastly, we aimed to extend the findings of the original study by probing the effect in the context of another risk-taking task, namely the Game of Dice Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. While the BART is one of the most popular implicit risk-taking tasks, it suffers from inherent methodological issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Most importantly, the BART is unable to clearly differentiate between uncertainty and risk. As outlined by De Groot and Thurik <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, the BART measures uncertainty at the beginning of the task (i.e. deciding under unknown outcome probabilities), while slowly shifting to measuring risk as participants implicitly learn about the underlying probability distribution (i.e. deciding under known outcome probabilities). Consequently, the BART measures two distinct decision-making processes, which are also associated with distinct forms of mental and neuronal processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</p><p>While the GDT matches the BART in terms of simplicity and shortness, it is based on explicit outcome probabilities, thus clearly measuring risk rather than uncertainty. Using the more explicit GDT to assess risk-taking will yield additional information on which domains of the constructs are affected by vestibular information. These findings might also inform or challenge the vestibular processing model proposed by and others De Maio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>As outlined in our preregistration, this replication study would be deemed successful, if we succeeded in replicating the polarity-specific vestibular effect found by the original study. Additionally, the equivalence test had to yield a non-significant result to deem the replication successful. Importantly, since the BART and GDT possibly do not measure identical aspects of risk-taking on a behavioural and neural level, we refrained from making the success of this replication dependent on the GDT findings. Since this is also the first study investigating the influence of GVS on risk-taking in the GDT, we abstained from postulating an a priori hypothesis for the GDT results.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Preregistration</head><p>This study was preregistered on the Open Science Framework using the replication recipe proposed by Brandt et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. The complete preregistration can be found here: https://osf.io/ufy7j.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Participants</head><p>A sample of 37 university students was recruited for this study (29 women, 8 men, mean age = 22.4, SD = 2.1). The sample size was based on an a priori power analysis, with the goal of achieving 90% power. The power analysis was based on the effect size reported in the original study (d = 0.548), relying on α = .05. The analysis was conducted using G*Power [Version 3.1.9.7; 40]. Left-handed participants as well as participants with neurological, psychiatric, vestibular, or auditory disorders were excluded from participating. Handedness was assessed using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</p><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Commission of the Human Sciences Faculty of the University of Bern (Approval number: 2023-10-00006) and was performed in accordance with the current version of the Declaration of Helsinki <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Experimental Procedure</head><p>Participants received general study information and signed an informed consent form before the GVS electrodes were attached to the participant's mastoid processes and neck. Each participant then performed 6 experimental blocks on a computer (27" screen, 2560 x 1440 resolution, 144 Hz refreshing rate; Brentford VR Midi Gamer PC, 16 GB RAM, 64-bit operating system). The BART was presented in block 1 -3, then the GDT was subsequently presented in block 4 -6 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1A)</ref>. During each experimental block, one of three possible stimulation configurations (L-GVS, R-GVS, SHAM) was applied in a predetermined order. More specifically, we partially counterbalanced the stimulation conditions across participants to ensure an optimally balanced within-subjects design. As in the original study, a timed break of 5 minutes was realized between the experimental blocks to avoid possible carryover effects of the stimulation in the subsequent experimental block. During these breaks, participants were asked to sit quietly on the chair. The participants performed all tasks while sitting on a chair with their chin resting on a chinrest, keeping them at a distance of 55cm from the computer screen. During the experimental blocks, participants were wearing headphones (SONY WH-1000XM4). The participants were instructed to earn as much money as possible throughout the experiment, but they were also informed at the beginning of the study (via the general study information) that these earnings would not be paid out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1.">Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)</head><p>Before starting the task, participants received written and oral instructions. As in the original study, the task consisted of red balloons which were presented in the middle of the screen <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1B)</ref>. The participants then had the chance to pump the balloon up by clicking a button below the balloon with the left mouse button using their right index finger. For each pump, the participants received 0.05 Swiss Francs (0.05 CHF ≈ 0.05 US dollars), while inflating the balloon. This temporarily gathered money was displayed on the bottom-left of the screen. The participants could then continue to inflate the balloon until the balloon exploded, in which case they would lose all the temporarily gathered money. Alternatively, they could decide to collect the temporarily gathered money by clicking the right mouse button with their right middle finger. In this case, the money was saved in a bank displayed on the top-left of the screen until the end of the experimental block. Depending on the outcome, the sentence "Ups! Der Ballon ist explodiert! ("Oops! Lost that one!") or "Sie haben ... CHF auf die Bankübertragen" (You have banked ... CHF)" was displayed in the middle of the screen for 1.5 seconds before a new balloon was presented. During each experimental block, 30 balloons were presented.</p><p>As in the original study, each balloon was associated with a specific breaking point and the order of presentation was randomized within each experimental block. The probability distribution of the balloon breaking points was taken from the original study, ranging from 1 to 128 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Before the 3 experimental BART blocks started, a practice block consisting of 5 balloons was presented to the participants in a randomized in order. The task was programmed and presented using PsychoPy3 [Version 2023.2.2; 43].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2.">Game of Dice Task (GDT)</head><p>Participants received written and oral instructions for the GDT right after finishing the last BART block. Each GDT block consisted of 18 dice throws (i.e. trials) and each participant started with a balance of +1000 francs (≈ 1000 US dollars). In each trial, the participants chose one out of 14 dice combinations by clicking the combination with the left mouse button. Each combination consisted of a set of 1 to 4 dice numbers, which were identical to the ones used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The numbers did not change throughout the task <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1C</ref>). They could then throw a separate dice using the right mouse button. If the number indicated by the thrown dice was included in the selected combination of dice numbers, the participants received a reward. Conversely, if the number was not included, participants lost the same amount of money. The gained or lost money per trial was dependent on the chosen dice combination: Choosing a set of 4 number combinations was associated with a gain or loss of 100 francs, a set of 3 combinations with 200 francs, a set of 2 combinations with 500 francs, and a set of one die with 1000 francs. As in the BART, the next trial was presented after 1.5 seconds.</p><p>The numbers indicated by the thrown die ranged from 1 -6, with each number appearing 3 times during one experimental block. The order of the numbers was randomized within each experimental block. As in the BART, a practise block of 5 trials was presented to the participants before the actual task. The task was programmed and presented using PsychoPy3 [Version 2023.2.2; 43].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation</head><p>GVS was administered using a stimulator (NeuroConn DC-Stimulator Plus, neurocare group AG, Ilmenau, Germany). A current with an intensity of 1mA (intial 5 seconds fade-in, 8 seconds fade-out) was delivered in a squared waveform. While stimulation fade-in and fade-out were not mentioned in the original study, they were implemented in this study to improve the comfort level and blinding for the different stimulation conditions. Two rubber electrodes (≈ 10cm 2 ) were attached to the mastoids to apply polarity-specific GVS. As in the original study, the left-anodal and right-cathodal configuration was defined as L-GVS, while the right-anodal and left-cathodal configuration was named R-GVS. Two additional electrodes for the SHAM stimulation were attached to the neck, placed 5cm away from the GVS electrodes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The purpose of this SHAM stimulation was to induce comparable skin sensations, while simultaneously controlling for unspecific arousal effects not associated with stimulating the vestibular system <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. All electrodes were attached using medical tape. Electrolyte gel was used to reduce the impedance between the skin and the electrodes. The electrodes were left in place for the whole experiment, and the different stimulation conditions were realized by replugging the electrode cables into the stimulator. The stimulation device was positioned behind the participants and all cables were unplugged after each stimulation block to prevent participants from noticing the changing plugging patterns. The stimulation was started at the beginning of each experimental block. Participants were allowed to begin the task after the stimulation fade-in (i.e. after 5 seconds) and the stimulation continued until the participants finished the all trials of one experimental block.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Data Analysis</head><p>All data analyses were performed using R </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1.">Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)</head><p>As outlined in the preregistration, the data analysis protocol closely followed the original study. The adjusted mean pumps, i.e. the average number of pumps for all unexploded balloons, was calculated for each participant to assess risktaking in each experimental block <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. This score was then used to test for a generic and polarity-specific stimulation effect. More specifically, to test if vestibular activation in general affects risk-taking, the average of the adjusted mean pumps in the L-GVS and R-GVS conditions (i.e. L-GVS + R-GVS / 2) was compared with the adjusted mean pumps in the SHAM condition. For the polarity-specific vestibular effect, the adjusted mean pumps in the L-GVS and R-GVS condition were compared. A two-sided paired t-test was used to test the significance of both effects.  Trials, in which the money was collected after 0 or 1 pumps, were excluded. This is reasonable because one can assume that they either were given unintentionally or indicated non-adherence to the task instructions (i.e. earning as much money as possible). Consequently, participants who collected the money after 0 or 1 balloon pumps in 10% of the trials in one of the three experimental blocks were excluded from the analysis. Additionally, only data from participants who performed all three BART blocks and all three GDT blocks entered the analysis. This criterion was applied to ensure complete data, while also excluding participants who had to terminate the experiment preemptively due to severe stimulation side-effects. Side-effects were monitored by asking the participants at the beginning of the experiment to report any unpleasant sensations to the experimenter.</p><p>On the basis of these criteria, 0.24% of all trials were excluded. However, no participant had to be excluded from the analysis based on the exclusion criteria mentioned above. Also, while some participants reported tingling sensations, none of them reported severe side-effects like pain, headaches, vertigo, or nausea.</p><p>Additionally, an equivalence test using the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure was performed <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Equivalence tests allow for rejecting the hypothesis that the effect size is as large or larger than the smallest effect size of interest <ref type="bibr">[SESOI;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. Thus, a significant test either implies that there is no meaningful effect at all or that the true effect size must be at least significantly smaller than the specified SESOI. Since only little information about the possible true effect size was available in this case, the minimal detectable effect size of the original study was used as a SESOI [d = 0.48 <ref type="bibr">; 46]</ref>. While this will not allow for the conclusion that there is no meaningful effect at all, it supports inferences about the true effect size. More specifically, a significant test would imply that the true effect could not have been detected by the original study, since the observed effect size is significantly smaller than the minimal detectable effect size.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that we also performed some additional exploratory analyses, which were not part of our preregistration. Firstly, the non-parameteric equivalent of the paired t-test (i.e. a two-sided Wilcoxon test for matched samples) was used to investigate the difference in adjusted mean pumps between the L-GVS and R-GVS condition. Corroborating the results with a non-parameteric test seemed necessary, because the R-GVS data indicated negative skewness and thus might violate the assumption of normality <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3A)</ref>.</p><p>Secondly, because the BART is prone to learning effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, we also evaluated the temporal dynamics of the adjusted mean pumps in our study. A 1x3 repeated-measure ANOVA with a Greenhouse-Geisser correction was performed with the factor "block" (i.e. experimental block 1-3) as the within-factor. The main effect was further explored by conducting paired t-tests between the three blocks, adjusting for multiple testing using the Bonferroni-Holm correction. Additionally, an unpaired two-sided t-test between the L-GVS and R-GVS condition using only the data from the first experimental block was performed. Focusing on the difference in adjusted mean pumps between the two groups in the first experimental block allows for a more confident elimination of potential learning effects.</p><p>Thirdly, Spearman's correlation coefficient between the adjusted mean pumps of the BART and the net score of the GDT was calculated to investigate the relationship between the two risk-taking tasks in this current study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2.">Game of Dice Task (GDT)</head><p>We assessed risk-taking in the GDT by calculating a net score used in other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>. More specifically, we subtracted the safer choices (i.e. choosing a combination with 3 to 4 dice) from the risky choices (i.e. choosing a combination with 1 to 2 dice). Consequently, a negative net score indicates a lower risk-taking tendency, while a positive score indicates a higher propensity. Analogous to the BART data analysis, we then used the net score to test for a generic and a polarity-specific vestibular effect. Due to the expected non-normality of the GDT net score distribution, the general vestibular activation was defined as the average of the median net scores of the L-GVS and R-GVS conditions (Median L-GVS + Median R-GVS / 2). The adjusted mean pumps resulting from the general vestibular activation were then again compared with the adjusted mean pumps in the SHAM condition. The polarity-specific vestibular effect was defined as the difference between the median net score of the L-GVS and R-GVS condition. A two-sided non-parameteric Wilcoxon test for matched samples was used to test for significance.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The current study investigated the influence of GVS on risk-taking, focusing on the effect of different polarity configurations, namely L-GVS and R-GVS.</p><p>Using a sample size informed by an a priori power analysis, a more rigorous experimental design, and an additional risk-taking task, we did not succeed in replicating the polarity-specific vestibular effect found by De Maio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> in our preregistered study. Despite the descriptive tendency in the BART data to act less risky in the L-GVS condition compared to the R-GVS condition, this difference was not significant in our sufficiently large sample even after performing additional exploratory analyses to account for a potential violation of normality.</p><p>In our opinion, this discrepancy cannot be attributed to task and design differences between the study by De Maio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and our study. While we acknowledge that task and design are not identical, the number of adjusted mean pumps, the proportion of exploded balloons, and the proportion of invalid trials in our study were comparable to the values communicated by De Maio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Additionally, it is highly unlikely that small differences in the task layout (e.g. the starting size of the balloon) lead to drastically different outcomes, because such deviations should not prevent the polarity-specific vestibular effect from emerging.</p><p>Instead, we suspect that the replication failure can be attributed to methodological differences, namely the counterbalancing of the design and the larger sample size. The BART is highly susceptible to learning effects, with participants generally showing increased risk-taking over time, indicating that participants start to intuitively grasp the underlying probability distribution of the balloon breaking points <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. This dynamic is also clearly apparent in our data, as shown by the significant increase in adjusted mean pumps from one experimental block to the next. Most notably, the descriptive tendency to act less risky in the L-GVS condition almost completely disappeared if we shifted our analysis of the polarity-specific effect to only the first block of the experimental session. Altogether, it seems highly likely that the dynamic of the task is an influential factor, especially in experiments with small samples and randomized assignments to experimental conditions. More concretely, a lower number of adjusted mean pumps in one stimulation condition could result from the fact that more participants began the experiment in this condition. This tendency might be further amplified by sampling error due to a small sample size.</p><p>The generic vestibular effect and the polarity-specific vestibular effect were also absent in the GDT, corroborating our BART findings. It is possible that decision-making in the GDT is less affected by the modulating character of the GVS stimulation, especially because risk and uncertainty are possibly represented differently in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. This disassociation is also corroborated by behavioural findings in our and other studies, which indicate that the BART and GDT scores are uncorrelated <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>. Crucially, it remains an open question if risk and uncertainty are divided by a gradual difference in activation within the same brain network or simply by recruiting different brain areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Limited evidence suggests a substantial overlap between the networks governing risky decisions in the BART and the GDT, but also points to differences in activation and connectivity patterns in brain areas like the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>. The weight and stability of these differences are yet to be evaluated, especially in light of the vast variety of task adaptations used for these studies and possible shifts from uncertainty to risk in the BART <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</p><p>We would also like to point out that we are unable to eliminate the possibility that our GDT results are influenced by order and habituation effects. Because our main goal was to closely replicate the study by De Maio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we abstained from switching the order of the two tasks. It is however likely that potential order effects are reduced by the fact that the BART and GDT measure independent aspects of risk-taking. Similarly, habituation effects caused by the increasing exposition to GVS throughout the experiment are possibly prevented by the regular longer breaks between the stimulation blocks. Regardless, our study suggests that neither implicit nor explicit risk-taking (i.e. acting under uncertainty or risk) are affected by vestibular signals induced by GVS.</p><p>Lastly, we found much smaller effect sizes for the polarity-specific effect in our sample compared to the original study. In the case of the BART, we also failed to reject the hypothesis that the effect size is at least as large or larger than the minimal detectable effect size of the original study. While this does not allow for the conclusion that the effect is too small to matter in general, we can infer that the true effect size is probably too small to be reliably detected by the study conducted by De Maio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. This supports the assumption that the effect sizes of polarity-specific vestibular effects are likely to be much smaller than previously stated. Assuming that they are comparable to other empirical effect sizes in the context of brain stimulation, much larger sample sizes are needed to make confident statements about the existence and meaningfulness of the effect.</p><p>Future studies should also adhere to rigorous methodological standards beyond an adequate sample size. As there are several possible ways by which vestibular information might influence cognition and decision-making, additional tasks, questionnaires, and imaging methods will be needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In the case of risk-taking, only studies with hypothetical scenarios have been used, while real-life outcomes of risk-taking were neglected. Such differences are important to consider, since real and hypothetical monetary rewards are associated with different behavioural outcomes and neural processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>.</p><p>Finally, additional research on GVS as a method is needed. Although simple in its application, there is an ongoing debate about which structures are activated by the stimulation and how the stimulation inputs are processed in the brain <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59]</ref>. Crucially, GVS probably does not exclusively activate the vestibular system. For example, current diffusion might stimulate the auricular vagus nerve, leading to modulations of brain activity independent of vestibular inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. Such entanglements are further complicated by different electrode positions radically influencing the strength of the induced electrical field and impact of GVS <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. Investigating these mechanisms as well as separating vestibular and confounding activation will be necessary to explain vestibular modulations of cognition and behaviour more convincingly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Conclusion</head><p>This current study failed to provide any evidence for polarity-specific vestibular stimulation effects using GVS in the context of risk-taking. We were unable to replicate the findings by De Maio et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and did not succeed in extending the effect to another risk-taking task, namely the GDT. We propose that the effect of the original study was mainly driven by random variation and task dynamics. Future studies investigating polarity-specific vestibular effects need to base their findings on larger sample sizes and rigorous experimental designs to enhance confidence in the effect, especially due to theoretical gaps regarding the neural mechanism.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>[Version 4.3.2; 44] and RStudio [Version 2023.06.2; 45].
