			<abstract>
				<p>Humans seek admiration to boost their social rank and engage in rivalry to protect it when fearing defeat. Traits such as narcissism and affective states such as depression are thought to influence perception of rank and motivation for dominance in opposite ways, but evidence of the underlying behavioral mechanisms is scant. We investigated the effects of trait dominance, dimensionally-assessed narcissism, and depression on behavioral responses to social defeat in a rigged video game tournament designed to elicit rivalry (stealing points from opponents) and admiration-seeking (paying for rank). We tested an undergraduate sample (N = 70, mean age = 21.5 years) and a clinical sample of predominantly depressed elderly (N = 85, mean age = 62.6 years). Both rivalry and admiration-seeking increased with time on task and were particularly enhanced in individuals high in trait dominance or narcissism. Participants engaged in more rivalry when pitted against high-ranked opponents, a tendency accentuated by trait dominance and partially mitigated by depression. Our findings provide behavioral evidence that social dominance and narcissism manifest in increased rivalry and admiration-seeking during social contests. Depression does not suppress general competitiveness but selectively inhibits upward-focused rivalry.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>As primates whose survival and reproduction depend on our standing in a group, we integrate social comparisons, victories, and defeats into an implicit estimate of our social status or rank. Thus, we learn our place and decide how to best improve or maintain it <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barkow et al., 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gilbert et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mahadevan et al., 2016)</ref>. Our implicit rank is recalibrated following unexpected outcomes of social comparisons against others <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ligneul et al., 2016)</ref>. Consistently, we tend to avoid confrontations with superiors without a reasonable probability of success <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gastorf et al., 1978)</ref> and prefer same-level comparisons, which give a better chance of increasing our status while remaining reasonably safe <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Festinger, 1954)</ref>. Individuals, as well as firms, political parties, and sports teams act more competitively when facing similarly-ranked counterparts than stronger ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dakin &amp; Arrowood, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hoffman et al., 1954;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kilduff et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">White &amp; Langer, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>When threatened with social defeat, people tend to engage in self-enhancement, which aims to increase social rank, and in self-protection, which aims to avoid further losses by fleeing or fighting back <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alicke &amp; Sedikides, 2009)</ref>. These competitive behaviors are subject to marked individual differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Garcia et al., 2013)</ref>, and can sometimes reach irrational and socially disadvantageous extremes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Geniole et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Sivanathan &amp; Pettit, 2010)</ref>.

These strategies, however, can backfire when affiliationrather than dominance-driven responses are called for <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Zeigler-Hill et al., 2018)</ref>, for example during prolonged periods of adversity <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Morf &amp; Rhodewalt, 2001</ref>). The prospect of losing status elicits intense emotions in highly narcissistic individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Rhodewalt &amp; Morf, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wright et al., 2017)</ref>, and leads to counteroffensives to reassert dominance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Back, 2018)</ref>. Back and colleagues termed narcissistic self-enhancement admirationseeking (seeking status through self-promotion), and narcissistic self-protection rivalry (antagonizing those perceived as threatening) (2013). Whereas healthy rivalry is attuned to the social rank of the opponent, highly narcissistic persons may engage in indisciminate rivalry <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Horton &amp; Sedikides, 2009)</ref>, often despite dire moral and financial consequences, and without explicit provocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(B√∂ckler et al., 2017)</ref>. At the same time, admiration-seeking takes a comparative form in more narcissistic individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Campbell et al., 2000)</ref>, and is mostly directed towards high-status others <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Horton &amp; Sedikides, 2009</ref>).</p><p>In contrast, depression is thought to shift priorities from achieving dominance to preventing conflict <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Johnson et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Price et al., 1994)</ref>. Animals subordinated by aggressive conspecifics become socially avoidant and lack vigor in seeking rewards, a state mediated by plasticity in the mesostriatal pathway and reversed by antidepressants <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berton et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Venzala et al., 2012)</ref>. Consistently, subordinate mice display lower anxiety in situations of chronic social defeat than dominant mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Larrieu et al., 2017)</ref>. In humans, depressive states appear to deflate one's implicit rank <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Battle, 1978)</ref>, decrease social comparisons and increase submissive behavior when these characteristics are measured by self-reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(O'Connor et al., 2002)</ref>. Conversely, assertively renegotiating one's role in key relationships is thought to be one mechanism of change in interpersonal therapy for depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lipsitz &amp; Markowitz, 2013)</ref>. These findings suggest that behavioral and neural plasticity induced by social defeat constitutes one component of human depressive states. Thus depressive symptoms are expected to inhibit both rivalry and admiration-seeking in competitive environments.</p><p>In summary, while self-report studies describe broadly opposing reactions to social defeat in narcissism and depression, this concept's behavioral manifestations are yet to be tested experimentally. Toward this end, we investigated the effects of trait dominance, dimensionally-measured narcissism, and depression on self-protective and self-enhancing behaviors in situations of defeat in a competitive setting. Using a rigged video game tournament paired with a league table, we elicited rivalry (stealing points from opponents), and admiration-seeking (paying to increase one's rank), in an undergraduate sample and a clinical sample of predominantly depressed older adults. To uncover effects of implicit rank (i.e. self-perceived status) on these behaviors, our task manipulated the rank of opponents to examine whether rivalry and admiration-seeking were directed upwards or downwards in the social hierarchy. We expected (H1a) both rivalry and admiration-seeking to increase as a reaction to the cumulative experience of defeat throughout the task, with (H1b) trait dominance and narcissism further enhancing both behaviors and (H1c) depression dampening them. With respect to the level of social comparisons, measured by rivalry and admiration-seeking as a function of the opponent's rank, we hypothesized that (H2a) it would be generally upward-focused, (H2b) with an additional upward shift in high trait dominance and narcissism and (H2c) a downward shift in depression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Sample 1 was composed of 70 undergraduate students enrolled at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada (mean age 21.5 years), who participated (in individual sessions) for course credit. Sample 2 was composed of 85 adults aged 50 or older (mean age 62.6 years) participating in the Longitudinal Research Program in Latelife Suicide, in Pittsburgh, United States, a larger ongoing study <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Szanto et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Correlates of the present behavioral task with suicidal behavior in Sample 2 will be reported elsewhere. Participants from Sample 2 were originally recruited as 25 healthy subjects with no lifetime history of psychiatric disorder and 60 subjects with clinical levels of depression, scoring 14 or higher on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) upon study recruitment. The present study treated depression as a continuous variable in both samples. Significant effects were nevertheless tested in a categorical sensitivity analysis in Sample 2 (Supplemental <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S3</ref>, Panel C). Sample characteristics can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Supplemental Table S1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral task</head><p>We used a rigged video game tournament to elicit rivalry and admiration-seeking behaviors under a threat of social defeat <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). Each of the 24 trials has the following steps: A, new opponent is displayed with name and league rank (participants are told that these opponents are all previous players whose performance has been prerecorded); B, 1st outcome measure: willingness to steal points from the opponent's future score in order to increase one's chance of defeating him/her; C, playing the snake arcade game for 20 seconds, with the goal of gathering as many points (apples) as possible, while one's score (the number of apples caught) is displayed, as well as a message at 10 seconds informing the participant whether he/she is ahead, behind, or the outcome is close; D, learning the contest's outcome, which defines whether the participant will move 5 ranks up or down in the global ranking. These outcomes are rigged towards a 2:1 defeat to victory ratio occurring in a pseudorandom order; E, 2nd outcome measure: willingness to buy extra rank; F, learning current rank in the competition. $$, each trial starts with a renewed virtual endowment that the participant can choose to spend on extra ranks. Participants are told that their real money payoff will be computed based on their savings from three random trials. Note. The computer version is in color.</p><p>The snake arcade game (adapted from the classic video game to Python 2.7) served as a basis to the competition and was embedded in a tournament interface programmed in Matlab, version 2016b. Each of the 24 trials was divided into a contest phase, when participants played a round of the snake arcade game against different opponents, and a ranking phase, where they gained or lost status in the tournament's league standings. Rivalry was measured by the willingness to steal points from the opponent before the contest (henceforth point stealing). Admiration-seeking was measured by the willingness to pay virtual money to increase one's rank in the league during the ranking phase (henceforth rank buying).</p><p>Whereas point stealing had a moral cost of being unfair and unsportsmanlike, participants were told that rank buying had a financial cost: they were instructed that their payment would be calculated based on the amount of virtual money saved on each trial, whereas their final standing in the game would not impact the payoff. The end-game payoffs were in fact the same for all participants.</p><p>To emulate a real-life social environment, participants were told they were playing against previous study participants whose performance had been recorded. To support this cover story, they chose an avatar to represent themselves in the game and entered a pseudonym; we instructed them not to use their real name, to preserve confidentiality.</p><p>As a final step, participants were asked to choose whether they wanted to appear in the tournament's league table against future participants. Participants were in fact playing against virtual opponents, arranged in a pseudo-random order and paired with predefined outcomes, having an overall 2:1 defeat to victory ratio.</p><p>To mask the rigged outcomes, two additional manipulations were added during the arcade game: the commands from the original snake game were reduced to only the left/right arrow keys, turning the snake 90 degrees left or right on its own axis of reference; second, fewer apples (points) were available for collection on losing trials. The goal of these manipulations was to enhance the game's difficultly, and elicit feelings of frustration and helplessness due to poor performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Reuderink et al., 2009)</ref>. Finally, virtual monetary endowments and real money payoffs were adapted to each sample: in Sample 1, participants received 5 CAD (Canadian Dollars) as the trial-by-trial endowment and 7.50 CAD as the overall payoff, while in Sample 2, participants received 20 USD (U. S. Dollars) as the trial-by-trial endowment and 25 USD as the payoff.</p><p>The game recorded four subject-dependent variables. The two main outcome measures were participants' choices for point stealing (integers ranging from 1: no point stealing to 5: stealing 10 points from opponent) and rank buying (integers ranging from 1: no rank buying to 5: buying 5 extra ranks for half of the trial-by-trial endowment's amount). Additionally, the game recorded participants' own rank (recoded for analysis in an increasing order from 1 = lowest rank to 200 = highest rank) and scores (number of points on the snake arcade game) on each trial. These two additional subject-dependent variables were used as covariates during the analysis of the main outcome measures (see Statistical Analysis below). Scores were additionally employed in quality checks measuring game performance and task engagement (Supplemental Material, pp. 10-12).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other assessments</head><p>At the beginning of the task, participants indicated their video game experience (integers ranging from 1: never played any games including smartphones and tablets to 5: playing every day). After the task, participants answered twelve additional questions about their motivations and impressions of the game that were examined in an exploratory analysis (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S7</ref>). Ethnicity and household income were missing in three participants of Sample 1.</p><p>Narcissism was assessed by the FFNI (Five-Factor Narcissism Inventory) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Sherman et al., 2015)</ref> and was treated as a continuous variable, given its dimensional structure corroborated by recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aslinger et al., 2018)</ref>. The FFNI's distribution in our two samples can be found in Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>. As a senstivity analysis testing the generalizability of our findings to the more pathological aspects of narcissism <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pincus et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Pincus et al., , 2014</ref>, we additionally used the BPNI (Brief Pathological Narcissism Inventory), a 28-item version of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Schoenleber et al., 2015)</ref>. We used total scores in our main analysis, but investigated whether specific dimensions of narcissism were driving the observed behavioral effects in an exploratory analysis including grandiose and vulnerable subscales of both the FFNI and the BPNI, and the agentic extraversion, antagonism, and narcissistic neuroticism subscales of the FFNI. The FFNI was missing in four participants of Sample 2. The BPNI was missing in one participant of Sample 1 and two participants of Sample 2.</p><p>Depression was assessed by the DASS-21 depression subscale in Sample 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Henry &amp; Crawford, 2005)</ref> and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) in Sample 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hamilton, 1960)</ref>.</p><p>Trait dominance was assessed in Sample 2 only by the IPIP-DS (International Personality Item Pool -Dominance Subscale) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Goldberg et al., 2006)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table S2</ref> for reliability coefficients of all psychometric measures and Supplemental <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S2</ref> for their correlations with task-related variables. Participants played the task on a laptop computer in Sample 1 and Windows tablets in Sample 2. After they had given written, informed consent to participate, a research assistant walked them through the task instructions, a practice session, and a survey of their prior video game experience, all of which were built in the task. Participants then played the rigged video game tournament for 24 trials. The test administrator stayed in the room but did not watch participants' actions after the first two trials. After finishing the task, participants filled out the additional assessments (DASS-21, FFNI and BPNI scales for Sample 1; FFNI, BPNI and IPIP-DS for Sample 2). In Sample 2, the HRSD was administered by a clinician within a week of the task session in the form of a semistructured interview.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>See Supplemental</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>We examined how (H1a) defeat and (H2a) opponents' rank influenced rivalry and admiration-seeking throughout the task, and how (H1b, H2b) trait dominance and narcissism as well as (H1c, H2c) depression moderated these relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dependent variable and covariates</head><p>All analyses were conducted in R version 3.4. Point stealing and rank buying were analyzed as continuous, trial-level variables that were person-mean centered around subject means, which resulted in a normal distribution. The person mean-centered scores were then entered as dependent variables in separate linear multi-level models (lme4::lmer). As within-subject centering of choices yielded a variance of 0 in the subject intercept, associations between the subject's mean and subject-level variables were not tested. Instead, we examined increases in behavior in response to task manipulations, and interactions with subject-level variables modulating these relationships. All reported models include age, sex, education (in Sample 2 only), ethnicity, household income, game experience, and depression as co-variates. Unless specified otherwise, main effects' significance did not differ without the inclusion of these variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model selection</head><p>On each step, model selection was performed using the likelihood-ratio test (function anova, package Stats). To diagnose multicollinearity, variance inflation factors adjusted for degrees of freedom were computed and were &lt;2 for all reported effects of retained models.</p><p>First, the best-fitting model containing only design variables was selected in both samples. Three experimental condition effects central to our research questions were retained in all models: (H1a) to investigate the effect of defeat, trial (time on task) measured overall exposure length to social defeat whereas most recent outcome (dummy-coded as 1 for victory and 0 for defeat) measured trial-by-trial positive/negative reinforcement on competitive behavior; (H2a) the level of social comparisons was measured as increases in behavior in response to the oppenent's rank (an integer between 1 = lowest rank and 200 = highest rank). All models additionally included an indicator of performance on the snake arcade game (score on the most recent trial) and participants' current rank. Significant predictors in Sample 1 were maintained in models built for Sample 2, even when non-significant. In models predicting rank buying, previous rank-buying choices had to be entered as a covariate, since buying extra rank improved one's own status in the game (see Supplemental <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure S2</ref> for correlations).</p><p>Second, we investigated the effects of trait dominance (measured by the IPIP-DS in sample 2 only), narcissism (measured by the FFNI in both samples) and depression (measured by the DASS-21 depression subscale in Sample 1 and the HRSD in Sample 2) by adding these psychometric constructs separately to the retained models with design variables, and allowing interactions between them. (H1b, H1c) An interaction effect with trial or outcome would inform us about the psychometric construct's effect on the behavioral response to defeat, whereas (H2b, H2c) an interaction with opponent's rank would suggest an effect on the level of social comparisons. In the case of narcissism, we further tested the effect with the BPNI and lower-level narcissistic dimensions.</p><p>Finally, we evaluated the retained models in a pooled analysis, in an effort to verify our results' consistency across age groups and levels of psychopathology.</p><p>Including sample as an independent variable, we ran all selected models described above in a dataset encompassing both samples (with the exception of models including trait dominance, which was only available in Sample 2). The pooled analysis kept all subject-level covariates, which necessitated approximate conversions of household income, education and depression. Household income was recoded as a ranked variable in Sample 2 after conversion of the cut-off values used in Sample 1 from CAD to USD.</p><p>The DASS-21 depression subscale in Sample 1 and the HRSD in Sample 2 were converted into percentile norms using a software tool developed by Crawford and colleagues in a general population sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Crawford et al., 2011)</ref>. Since percentile norms were not directly available for the HRSD, values of the Carroll Rating Scale for Depression were used instead, which is a self-report version of the HRSD that shares the same items and scoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Carroll et al., 1981)</ref>. Education was assumed to be 13 years in Sample 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity analyses</head><p>We conducted four sensitivity analyses:</p><p>(a) To verify that our findings were truly reflecting behavioral changes arising in response to the task, we measured stereotypical response rates (responses with a variance of zero on a given outcome measure) between samples ( <ref type="table">Supplemental Table   S3</ref>), compared stereotypical responders to the other participants on demographic and psychometric measures (Supplemental <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table S4</ref>) and retested all main findings after excluding participants who engaged in stereotypical responding on both point stealing and rank buying (Supplemental <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>).</p><p>(b) Given the well-established role of sex in competitive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Byrnes et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Geniole et al., 2017)</ref> and the predominance of female participants in both of our samples (resp. 78.6% in Sample 1 and 60.0% in Sample 2; <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Supplemental Table S1</ref>), we tested all main findings' robustness to sex*trial, sex*outcome and sex*opponent's rank covariates, added simultaneously to our selected models (Supplemental <ref type="table">Table S6</ref>). We subsequently evaluated all main findings for moderation by sex, one interaction at a time (Supplemental <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table S7</ref>).</p><p>(c) We tested our main findings in the pooled analysis for sample-level differences by letting sample moderate them.</p><p>(d) We investigated whether the effects found with the FFNI would generalize to the BPNI by substituting BPNI total scores to FFNI total scores in the models in question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory analyses</head><p>We performed three additional exploratory analyses, in an effort to better situate our main findings within narcissistic dimensions and the task's general dynamics:</p><p>(a) Effects found with the FFNI total score were tested with both the FFNI's and the BPNI's subscales in the pooled analysis, to investigate which specific dimensions were driving them.</p><p>(b) We analyzed performance (scores on the snake arcade game) in linear mixedeffects models having subject-level intercepts as random effect (Supplemental Material, pp. 10-12, Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S5</ref>). This analysis enabled us to test differences between samples (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref>, Panel A) and the effects of trait dominance, narcissism and depression on task engagement (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref>, Panel B).</p><p>(c) As a final step in the pooled analysis, we looked at correlations of mean point stealing and rank buying behaviors and psychometric constructs with participants' self-reported motivations and impressions collected at the end of the task (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S7</ref>). Our goal was to check whether the observed behaviors and their moderations by psychometric measures was consistent with how participants experienced the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>For the reader's convenience, below, we focus on replicated findings illustrated with statistics from the pooled analysis and only describe samplewise models in the main text in the case of inconsistencies (and for the trait dominance measure, collected only in Sample 2). Samplewise findings are further detailed in Supplemental Figures S3 and S4.   (H1a) We found no effect of the immediately preceding outcome. However, over the task both point stealing and rank buying increased in reaction to defeat, as evidenced by a main effect of trial (œá 2 1 = 55.33, p &lt; .001 for point stealing; œá 2 1 = 20.11, p &lt; .001 for rank buying; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref>).</p><p>(H1b) Trait dominance predicted greater increases in both point stealing and rank buying over time, as indicated by a trait dominance*trial interaction in Sample 2, where the IPIP-DS was administered (œá 2 1 = 7.45, p = .006 for point stealing; œá 2 1 = 5.90, p = .015 for rank buying; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3A</ref>). Similarly, narcissism increased point stealing and rank buying over time (œá 2 1 = 7.91, p = .005 for point stealing; œá 2 1 = 11.28, p &lt; .001 for rank buying; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 3</ref>, Panel B). The narcissism*trial effect was not significant in the model predicting point stealing in Sample 1, but shared a similar pattern in all other cases (Supplemental <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S3</ref>, Panel A).</p><p>(H1c) Depression did not influence point stealing and rank buying over time.  that people stole more points when pitted against high-ranked opponents (œá 2 1 = 28.33, p &lt; .001) and even more so when facing a high-ranked opponent after achieving a high score on the previous round (opponent's rank*previous score: œá 2 1 = 5.42, p = .020).</p><p>(H2b) A positive trait dominance*opponent's rank interaction predicting point stealing (œá 2 1 = 10.90, p = .001) indicated that participants with higher levels of trait dominance preferentially engaged in point stealing against high-ranked opponents <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 4)</ref>. No moderation effect was present with narcissism.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S3</ref>, Panel B), where depression scores were tightly distributed around the population average (Supplemental <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref>). In Sample 2, the effect was robust to covariates and remained present when depression was analyzed categorically (œá 2 1 = 9.33, p = .002; Supplemental <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S3</ref>, Panels B and C)</p><p>Rank buying (H2a) Rank buying was not higher against high-ranked opponents overall, but did increase more against them over time, as evidenced by an opponent's rank*trial interaction (œá 2 1 = 4.22, p = .040). This effect was not significant in Sample 2.</p><p>(H2b, H2c) We found no interactions of opponent's rank with trait dominance, narcissism or depression predicting rank buying in the pooled analysis. Initial narcissism*opponent's rank*trial and narcissism*opponent's rank effects found in Sample 1 (resp. œá 2 1 = 4.40, p = .036 and œá 2 1 = 4.75, p = .029; Supplemental <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure S4</ref> <ref type="bibr">)</ref> were no longer significant in Sample 2 and in the pooled models, and were therefore not retained among our main findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sensitivity analyses</head><p>(a) Stereotypical response rates were consistent across samples. Stereotypical responders represented respectively 12 and 13% of participants in Sample 1 and 2 (Supplemental <ref type="table">Table S3</ref>). They did not differ from other subjects, with the exception of none being African-American in Sample 2 vs. 18.7% in the rest of the sample (Supplemental <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table S4</ref>). Excluding stereotypical responders from the analysis did not change any of our main findings (Supplemental <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>).</p><p>(b) Including sex*trial, sex*outcome and sex*opponent's rank did not influence our main findings either in the pooled analysis, or in the individual samples, with the exception of the main effect of trial on rank buying that lost significance in Sample 2 but maintained comparable effect magnitude to the principal model (Supplemental <ref type="table">Table   S6</ref>). Interaction effects with sex were not significant in models predicting point stealing (Supplemental <ref type="table" target="#tab_11">Table S7</ref>). With respect to rank buying, negative sex*trial and sex*trial*opponent's rank effects emerged in the pooled analysis (resp. œá 2 1 = 6.72, p = .010 and œá 2 1 = 7.96, p = .0047), the former being only significant in Sample 1 (œá 2 1 = 7.22, p = .007) and the latter in Sample 2 (œá 2 1 = 4.71, p = .030). Sex did not moderate effects of trait dominance, narcissism or depression.</p><p>(c) Our main findings did not generally differ across samples in the pooled analysis, with the following exceptions: a sample*opponent's rank interaction predicting point stealing (œá 2 1 = 4.70, p = .030) and a sample*trial interaction predicting rank buying (œá 2 1 = 5.10, p = .024) indicated similar effect directions in both samples, but a greater effect magnitude, respectively, in Sample 2 for opponent's rank predicting point stealing and in Sample 1 for trial predicting rank buying.</p><p>(d) Similar narcissism*trial effects were found with the BPNI as with the FFNI in the pooled analysis (œá 2 1 = 7.65, p = .006 for point stealing; œá 2 1 = 4.33, p = .038 for rank buying; <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). In the individual Samples, this effect did only reach significance for point stealing in Sample 1 (œá 2 1 = 3.97, p = .046). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory analyses</head><p>(a) With respect to lower-level narcissism dimensions <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2)</ref>, no clear specificity emerged, with nevertheless higher consistency of effects with grandiosity than with vulnerability. In terms of the FFNI's three-factor subdivision, agentic extraversion was associated with both point stealing and rank buying (resp. œá 2 1 = 7.28, p = .007 and œá 2 1 = 4.28, p = .039), antagonism with rank buying (œá 2 1 = 5.54, p = .019) and narcissistic neuroticism with none of the behaviors.  further accentuated performance over time (œá 2 1 = 6.67, p = .010 for trait dominance in Sample 2, where the scale was collected; œá 2 1 = 7.65, p = .006 for narcissism in the pooled analysis). In the case of narcissism, this effect was driven by grandiosity as measured by both the FFNI and the BPNI (resp. œá 2 1 = 10.34, p = .001 and œá 2 1 = 7.50, p = .006) and in the FFNI's three factor subdivision, by agentic extraversion (œá 2 1 = 8.98, p = .003) and to a lesser extent by antagonism (œá 2 1 = 4.12, p = .042). Antagonism however also predicted lower scores overall (œá 2 1 = 4.37, p = .037), as did FFNI and BPNI vulnerability subscales (resp. œá 2 1 = 6.85, p = .009 and œá 2 1 = 10.02, p = .002). Depression predicted lower scores overall (œá 2 1 = 4.53, p = .033), without influencing improvement over time. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We used a rigged video game tournament experiment to elicit rivalry and admiration-seeking behaviors and investigate the level of social comparisons under the threat of defeat. We observed an increase of both behaviors with time on task, which was enhanced by trait dominance and narcissism. In contrast, depression did not inhibit these behaviors, against our prediction. With respect to the level of social comparisons, we found that upward-focused rivalry was accentuated by trait dominance and inhibited by depression. However, we observed no consistent effect of narcissism on the level of social comparisons. Taken together, our findings are consistent with the maintainance of social status constituting a general human motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson et al., 2015)</ref>, and further suggest that this goal is moderated by narcissism and depression on two distinct levels, both of which are linked to dominance: while narcissism primarily increases the intensity of rivalry and admiration-seeking, depression influences rivalry's objective, by inhibiting upward-focused ambitions.</p><p>Experimentally corroborating the rivalry/admiration theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Back et al., 2013)</ref>, more narcissistic persons were more intensely motivated to protect and promote their implicit rank in the face of social defeat <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3</ref>, Panel B). Similarly to Back and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Back et al., 2013)</ref>, we observed that these behaviors were the most consistent in grandiose and agentic extraversion dimensions, but that they also occured in more pathological forms of narcissism, as evidenced by similar albeit less consistent findings with the BPNI overall and with the vulnerability subscales of both narcissism measures <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2)</ref>. Further, these behaviors scaled in similar ways with trait dominance as with narcissism <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3, Panel A)</ref>, which was consistent with overlapping dominance-driven motivations between the two constructs, as outlined in the Dominance Behavioral System <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Johnson et al., 2012)</ref>. Both narcissism and trait dominance also correlated with faster improvement in performance on the snake arcade game (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref>, Panel B), corroborating the increase in adaptive competitiveness found in narcissism, in particular in grandiose narcissism <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Luchner et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>The fact that participants high in narcissism started the task with lower rates of rivalry and admiration-seeking than their less narcissistic counterparts <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Figure 3</ref>, Panel B) is consistent with these behaviors' compensatory role. Narcissism has been linked to overestimating one's future performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Farwell &amp; Wohlwend-Lloyd, 1998</ref>), suggesting that more narcissistic participants only resorted to alternative pathways once their own performance appeared insufficient to achieve dominance. This finding supports the recently developed SPIN (Status Pursuit In Narcissism) model, which suggests that rivalry arises when primary admiration-based pathways to status are hindered, such as the possibility to win the tournament by playing well on our rigged task <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Grapsas et al., 2020</ref>). Yet, in our paradigm, more narcissistic participants pursued admiration-seeking (paying for rank) simultaneously with rivalry. This suggests that obtaining status by achieving dominance over others remained important for participants independently of achieving status by self-promotion, similarly to what is described in the dominanceprestige model of status pursuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cheng, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, only admiration-seeking was enhanced by narcissistic antagonism <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">(Table 2)</ref>, which in turn correlated with revenge motivations (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S7)</ref>.</p><p>Rivalry in our paradigm matched Back's definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Back, 2018)</ref>, namely a willingness to surpass and devalue others in a socially insensitive way and consistently correlated with the self-reported motivation of outperforming others (Supplemental <ref type="figure">Figure S7</ref>). However,</p><p>given that point stealing occured before playing against a given opponent, our measure of rivalry did not include a component of revenge. On the other hand, our measure of admiration-seeking (rank buying) took place right after learning the trial's outcome and thus likely acquired a rivalry component. This is also suggested by the increase over time of rank buying against high-ranked opponents <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref>. Consistently, prior research found that self-enhancing/admiration-seeking can also be dominance-not only prestige-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Zeigler-Hill et al., 2019)</ref>, and could take an upward-focused, comparative form <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Campbell et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Horton &amp; Sedikides, 2009)</ref>. More generally, our findings highlight the complexity of social competion dynamics that tend to entangle the motivations underlying rivalry and admiration-seeking behaviors in real life.</p><p>Consistently with our second hypothesis with respect to most intense social comparisons, rivalry was preferentially upward-focused, and this was enhanced by trait dominance <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 4, left panel)</ref>. Although our paradigm did not test participants'</p><p>preferred level of social challenges, which may have reflected their implicit rank more directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Festinger, 1954)</ref>, a strong performance on the previous trial further accentuated rivalry against high-ranked opponents, supporting an upward shift in implicit rank and an increase in assertiveness after positive prediction errors about one's capability <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ligneul et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mahadevan et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, depression inhibited upward-directed rivalry <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Figure 4, right panel)</ref>.</p><p>This was not explained by a lack of engagement in the task, as indicated by intact performance improvement in more depressed individuals (Supplemental Material, p. 11).</p><p>Nor was it due to decreased competitiveness, since depression did not inhibit point stealing. Depressed individuals exhibited rivalry in a manner insensitive to others' rank and were not selectively motivated to dominate high-status others. Depression has been found to correlate positively with performance-avoidance goals, i.e. trying not to underperform compared to others, and negatively with performance-approach goals, i.e. aiming to outperform others <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Sideridis, 2005)</ref>. Further, depressive individuals' insecurity about their own social rank has been found to prompt competitiveness primarily out of fear of inferiority and of subsequent rejection <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gilbert et al., 2009)</ref>. Thus, the observed behavioral patterns align with the social competition hypothesis of depression, stating that by down-regulating dominance motivations, depression grants survival to presumably weaker individuals in a hostile environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Price et al., 1994</ref>). Yet, our findings leave the question open whether depression's dominance-inhibiting effect stems from lower implicit rank, as suggested by some <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gilbert et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mahadevan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sullivan, 1953)</ref>, and if this effect follows a vicious cycle, sustaining lower implicit rank by impeding higher-level social achievements, as outlined in interpersonal theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Safran &amp; Greenberg, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>The strengths of our study include the nuanced and novel experimental assessment of competitive behavior dynamics and sensitivity to social hierarchy. Our findings' consistency across two very different samples in terms of age and psychopathology and their robustness to sex differences and other demographic covariates add to their generalizability. As limitations, we note the moderate sizes of each individual sample and the absence of a trait dominance measure in Sample 1. In addition, the weaker manipulation effects in Sample 2 could be due to older adults' lower cognitive functioning and/or relative inexperience with the video game interface. Our participants were not specifically sampled for high/pathological levels of narcissism, since most of the conceptual frameworks relevant to our paradigm have focused on normally distributed subclinical narcissistic traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Back et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Grapsas et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mahadevan et al., 2016)</ref>. Future research should nonetheless explore how our behavioral findings map on narcissism's more pathological forms, namely narcissistic personality disorder. Finally, although the admiration and rivalry framework developed by Back and colleagues heavily informed our thinking when building our paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Back et al., 2013)</ref>, the Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire (NARQ) was not used in the current study. The NARQ should be included in future works to calibrate our behavioral measures of rivalry and admiration to self-report items.</p><p>Our approach not only captured behaviors that map on narcissistic and depressive semiology, such as narcissistic dominance-striving or depressive dominanceinhibition, but also dissected how these tendencies are expressed in social defeat. The decisional biases highlighted by our findings are likely reflected in everyday behavior in both general and clinical populations. The fact that social defeat and status can be successfully manipulated experimentally trial-by-trial in real time opens the way for the study of their physiological and neural correlates, going beyond the classic bargaining games predominantly employed to date.

Numbers indicate coefficients of significant correlations (p &lt; .05). Questions A1 to A4 (in blue) investigated participants' impressions about the task and were answered on an analog scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (absolutely). Questions M1 to M8 (in black) explored participants' motivations throughout the competition on a five-point Likert scale going from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Participants encountered the eight M questions and then the four A questions at the very end of the task, as these questions were built in the tournament's interface.
