			<abstract>
				<p>Most current sequential sampling models have random between-trial variability in their parameters. These sources of variability make the models more complex in order to fit response time data, do not provide any further explanation to how the data were generated, and have recently been criticised for allowing infinite flexibility in the models. To explore and test the need of between-trial variability parameters we develop a simple sequential sampling model of N-choice speeded decision making: the racing diffusion model. The model makes speeded decisions from a race of evidence accumulators that integrate information in a noisy fashion within a trial. The racing diffusion does not assume that any evidence accumulation process varies between trial, and so, the model provides alternative explanations of key response time phenomena, such as fast and slow error response times relative to correct response times. Overall, our paper gives good reason to rethink including between-trial variability parameters in sequential sampling models</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Evidence accumulation is arguably the most dominant theory of how people make speeded decisions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Donkin &amp; Brown, 2018</ref>, for a review), and it is typically instantiated in sequential sampling models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001</ref>; . These models provide an accurate account of correct and error response time (RT) distributions as well as the corresponding accuracy rates in speeded decision making tasks. The models also allow researchers to translate the data into the meaningful psychological parameters that generate the data.</p><p>Sequential sampling models assume a simple cognitive architecture consisting of stimulus encoding, response selection, and overt response execution. To make a decision, people begin with an initial amount of evidence for all response options, the starting point of evidence accumulation <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 1</ref>). From the starting point, more evidence is continually sampled from the stimulus, which accumulates at a rate of drift rate towards the corresponding response threshold. When the accumulated evidence crosses a response threshold this triggers the corresponding overt response. The quality of evidence sampled from the stimulus governs the drift rate, which can be interpreted as the speed of information processing. Higher response thresholds mean that a person needs more evidence to trigger a response, and so, threshold settings represent how cautious a person is. Starting points and response thresholds can be different for different response options capturing any inherit biases people have. The time necessary for processes outside of evidence accumulation is the non-decision time, which includes the time needed for perceptual encoding and overtly executing a motor response.</p><p>Researchers often assume that the core parameters of sequential sampling models, such as drift rates, starting points, and non-decision times vary between trials. There are a number of reasons for these sources of variability. Below we will discuss the Non-Decision Time <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 1</ref> . A typical sequential sampling model process. Only one accumulator is illustrated, but multiple alternative decisions are modeled by multiple racing accumulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001</ref>; S. D. <ref type="bibr">S. D. Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2005)</ref> or single accumulators with two boundaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Link &amp; Heath, 1975)</ref>.</p><p>evidence for between-trial variability in drift rates, starting points, and non-decision times. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ratcliff (1978)</ref> introduced drift-rate variability to model item differences in a recognition-memory task using a single accumulator model with two boundaries, which is known as the drift diffusion model (DDM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ratcliff &amp; Tuerlinckx, 2002)</ref>. In this paradigm, between-trial variability in drift rate is thought to be analogous to the memory evidence distributions in signal detection theory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Egan, 1958)</ref>. In recognition memory, sequential sampling models produce the same conclusions about evidence variability as signal detection theory (such as conclusions drawn from zROC slopes; <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Starns &amp; Ratcliff, 2014)</ref> and can accurately measure relative differences in evidence variability when it is directly manipulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Starns, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Osth, Dennis, &amp; Heathcote, in press)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence for Variability in Drift Rate</head><p>Without between-trial variability in drift rate the DDM predicts perfect accuracy with unlimited processing time <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Turner, Gao, Koenig, Palfy, &amp; McClelland, 2017)</ref>. The variability is also useful because it enables the DDM to predict the common finding of slower errors than correct responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998)</ref>. In fact, between-trial variability in drift rate is largely determined by the relative speeds of correct and error RT distributions, rather than the overall shape of the RT distributions and accuracy rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Ratcliff, 2013)</ref>. Between-trial variability in drift rate is not the only component that can predict relatively slow error RTs. Within the DDM architecture, some researchers suggest collapsing response boundaries as a function of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ditterich, 2006b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Ditterich, , 2006a</ref>, which means less evidence is needed to make a response over time and results in longer decisions being less accurate. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Link and Heath (1975)</ref> noted that the random walk, which is a DDM in discrete time, can predict unequal error and correct RT distributions with certain distribution assumptions for the moment-to-moment evidence accumulation rate, such as the Laplace distribution.</p><p>Double-pass experiments also provide empirical evidence for between-trial variation in drift rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Ratcliff, Voskuilen, &amp; McKoon, 2018)</ref>. In these experiments, the same perceptual stimuli are presented at two separate trials during an experimental session. Typically there is strong agreement on performance of these 2 trials. But if the drift rates of participants only vary within-trial, then agreement on the two trials is no greater than chance, meaning that between-trial variability in drift rate is needed to capture the empirical data. Although, the experiment does not determine if the variability is random or systematic <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Evans, Tillman, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>There is also neurophysiological evidence for between-trial variability in drift rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Ratcliff, Philiastides, &amp; Sajda, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ratcliff, Sederberg, Smith, &amp; Childers, 2016)</ref>. For example, researchers have sorted trials of perceptual discrimination tasks by whether they show high amplitude or low amplitude EEG. They then sorted these two groups of trials by early stimulus related or late decision related components of the EEG. They found that for the early component trials, there were no differences between the drift rates of the low amplitude and high amplitude signals. But for the late component trials there were differences between the drift rates between the low amplitude and high amplitude trials. Because more positive drift rates were obtained from data associated with more positive EEG amplitudes, then it can be concluded that single-trial amplitudes of the late EEG explain some of the trial-to-trial variability in decision-related evidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence for Variability in Starting Points</head><p>In simple RT tasks, where participants only need to make one response, starting-point is required to account for the possibility of premature sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Laming, 1968)</ref>, where the evidence accumulation process begins before the onset of the stimulus.</p><p>In simple RT, participants cannot know to start sampling evidence at the presentation of the stimulus because the stimulus detection is itself the evidence being accumulated (i.e., detection cannot be used to trigger the detection process). In choice RT tasks, however, stimulus onset provides the signal to start sampling evidence that discriminates between different types of response options. One may even find that the amount of variability in starting points is smaller in choice paradigms than detection paradigms.</p><p>Pre-mature sampling is the theoretical motivation for starting point variability, but in relation to data, starting point variability is often included in sequential sampling models to explain the empirical finding that error responses can be faster than correct responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Laming, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Smith &amp; Vickers, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Ratcliff, Van Zandt, &amp; McKoon, 1999)</ref>. When considering neurophysiological evidence, we find that differences in starting points across trials may be produced by sequential effects (for example <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fecteau &amp; Munoz, 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variability in Non-Decision Time</head><p>Researchers who use the DDM typically assume that non-decision time is variable across trials. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Ratcliff, Gomez, and McKoon (2004)</ref> found that including non-decision time variability allowed the DDM to better fit the .1 quantile of RT distributions from a lexical decision task <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ratcliff, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2004)</ref>.</p><p>Theoretically, non-decision time variability is plausible because motor response times could have small variability or stimuli may not be perceptually encoded as efficiently on each trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Issues with Assuming Between-Trial Variability</head><p>It is likely that some of the between-trial variability in the core parameters in most sequential sampling models is systematic and some is random <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Evans et al., 2019)</ref>. A key job for theory is to sort out the systematic variance and explain it. Despite this, the current strategy in RT modeling is to assume all the between-trial variability is random, characterized by some probability distribution, such as a uniform or a Gaussian. But, there are several issues with the assumptions of random between-trial variability.</p><p>First, by adding these between trial sources of noise, sequential sampling models have become more and more complex in order to fit RT data. Models such as the DDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Ratcliff &amp; Tuerlinckx, 2002)</ref> assume between-trial variability in starting point, non-decision time, and drift rate in addition to within-trail variability in drift rate. The problem is that these extra between-trial variability parameters do not always help.</p><p>Sometimes fixing the values of certain between-trial variability parameters can improve estimation of the more psychologically interesting parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lerche &amp; Voss, 2016)</ref>. It is relatively difficult to accurately estimate between trial variability parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boehm et al., 2018)</ref> and researchers have shown that models that have no between-trial variability are able to detect experimental effects better than the DDM with all between-trial variability parameters (van Ravenzwaaij, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Donkin, &amp; Vandekerckhove, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Second, the between-trial variability assumptions are not part of the process model that explains how the RT data are generated. The core process of sequential sampling models is the integration of evidence to a threshold, which explains how someone makes a decision, but the between-trial variability assumptions provide no additional explanation of the decision process and are simply added to help the models fit data. That is not to say there is no evidence for decision parameters being different across trials, but that assuming between-trial variability represented as some probability distribution does not do the job of good theory in distinguishing between systematic and random variability.</p><p>Finally, given the recent claims of <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jones and Dzhafarov (2014)</ref> -that certain between-trial drift variability assumptions can allow infinite flexibility of sequential sampling models (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Heathcote, Wagenmakers, &amp; Brown, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Smith, Ratcliff, &amp; McKoon, 2014)</ref> -it is important to explore and test models that do not make these assumptions.</p><p>Given these issues with the assumptions of between-trial variability, we test the necessity of the assumptions by evaluating the performance of a sequential sampling model that drops the between-trial sources of noise. We use the racing diffusion model (RDM), which relies on within-trial variability in drift rate instead of between-trial variability in drift rate. In the past, versions of racing diffusion models have been fit to choice RT data <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Leite &amp; Ratcliff, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Teodorescu &amp; Usher, 2013)</ref>, but these models were applied using extensive Monte Carlo simulation methods. Moreover, racing</p><p>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion processes have been used in more complex models that account for choice RT and confidence judgements <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Ratcliff &amp; Starns, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, 2013</ref>. Trish</p><p>Van Zandt developed closed form equations for the likelihood of racing diffusions to account for performance in the stop signal paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Logan, Van Zandt, Verbruggen, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2014)</ref>. By dropping the stop signal component we can apply a more general model of N-choice decision making, for example see <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Osth &amp; Farrell, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Turner, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper we fit the RDM to several previously published empirical data sets demonstrating that it can account for the full distribution of correct and error RTs as well as accuracy rates. We also fit the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA;  to the same data and compare how the RDM model performs relative to the LBA, which assumes drift rates vary between-trials rather than within-trials. We then assess the correspondence between the key RDM and LBA parameters to understand the mimicry between models that assume within-trial variability instead of between-trial variability. Before testing the RDM with model fitting, we first discuss the details of the RDM and how it accounts for benchmark RT phenomena without between-trial variability parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Racing Diffusion Model</head><p>The RDM represents the process of choosing between N alternatives <ref type="bibr">(1, 2, 3, ..., N)</ref> using N racing evidence accumulators. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, we illustrate a two-choice RDM that represents a decision between 'left' and 'right' -perhaps in a task where participants need to determine if dots on a screen are moving to the left or to the right. The second source of noise is the within-trial variation of drift rate, or change in evidence X. This noise is mathematically described by the following stochastic differential equation (the Wiener diffusion process):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">dX(t) = v • dt + s • dW (t),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where s • dW (t) represents the Wiener noise process with mean 0 and variance s 2 • dt.</p><p>If the model only has within-trial drift rate variability and no between-trial starting point variability, then the Wald distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Wald, 1947)</ref> describes the first-passage time distribution for a single accumulator with positive drift rate toward a positive response threshold. The Wald distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Wald, 1947)</ref> is often used to explain simple RT data, where participants only need to make one type of response <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Heathcote, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Ratcliff &amp; Van Dongen, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ratcliff &amp; Strayer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ratcliff, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">W.

The Wald probability density function is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">f i (t|b, v) = b(2πt 3 ) − 1 2 exp[− 1 2t (vt − b) 2 ],<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where b and v are the response threshold and drift rate, respectively. When the model includes non-decision time, response times are described by a shifted-Wald distribution, with a shift equal to the non-decision time.</p><p>The RDM can also include between-trial variability in starting point, but as we show in the subsequent section, it is not required for fast errors. Starting point variability also accounts for when participants are uncertain about when to start sampling evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Laming, 1968</ref>). On some trials, participants may begin sampling before the trial begins resulting in a higher starting point. 1 A is the probability density function of the uniform starting point distribution. The probability density function of finishing times for the RDM with within-trial variability in drift rate and between-trial variability in starting point can be computed analytically <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Logan et al., 2014)</ref>. Using φ(x) and Φ(x) to represent the density and cumulative distribution functions of the standard normal distribution, respectively, and with</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">α = (b − A − tv) √ t<label>(3)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">β = (b − tv) √ t<label>(4)</label></formula><p>then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">g i (t|b, v, A) = 1 A [−vΦ(α) + 1 √ t φ(α) + vΦ(β) − 1 √ t φ(β)]<label>(5)</label></formula><p>for v &gt; 0 and A &gt; 0, and the Wiener process standard deviation is assumed to be 1. If v = 0, then</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">g i (t|b, A) = 1 A [ 1 √ t φ(α) − 1 √ t φ(β)],<label>(6)</label></formula><p>and if A = 0 then the associated probability density function is Equation 2. The cumulative distribution function is presented in the appendix.</p><p>In the RDM, there is a race between N accumulators and we want to know the time taken for the first accumulator to reach the threshold. The probability of the first accumulator finishing from all accumulators is given by the following defective probability density function:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">g i (t) = f i (t) j =i (1 − F j (t)),<label>(7)</label></formula><p>where f i (t) and F j (t) are the probability density and cumulative density functions of first-passage time distributions for the i th and j th accumulators. 1 Substituting Equations 2, 5, or 6 for the probability density distributions in Equation 7 allows us to generate likelihood functions to fit the RDM model to data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Slow Errors and Fast Errors from Race Models</head><p>Multi-accumulator models predict slow errors by virtue of the race architecture,</p><p>where the error accumulator is slower than the correct accumulator on average <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Smith &amp; Vickers, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Townsend &amp; Ashby, 1983)</ref>. The LBA accounts for fast errors by including both starting point variability and between-trial variability. In a speed emphasized condition, participants set their response thresholds close to the top of the starting point distribution. If the accumulator corresponding to the error response samples near the top of the starting point distribution and the correct accumulator samples closer to the bottom, then there is little time for the correct accumulator to overtake and win the race. Thus, error responses in this situation occur because the accumulator started close to the threshold, which also results in relatively fast responses.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, we present a simulation to demonstrate how the RDM predicts fast and slow error RTs relative to correct RT. We generated 10, 000 trials for a single participant for a range of different threshold values. The threshold, b, was systematically varied from 0 to 2. The other parameters were fixed to the following values: A = 1 (when included), V Correct = 4, V Error = .5, T er = 0.2. Due to the race architecture, the RDM predicts slow errors when the error drift rate is slower than the correct drift rate and the response thresholds are high enough to negate early terminating errors due to within-trial noise. However, when the response thresholds are close to the starting point, the RDM predicts fast errors due to the within-trial drift rate variability. 2 So the RDM can account for fast and slow errors with only one source of noise. Fast errors in the RDM with only within-trial drift rate variability are at most 10 ms faster than the mean correct RT (left panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). With starting point variability, fast errors from the RDM get up to 40 ms faster than the mean correct RT (right panel of <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). The lowest thresholds considered produced RTs of 211 ms and the largest thresholds produced RTs of 770 ms, which covers a range that we would expect to see in empirical data. Although, a survey of papers where enough RT data is reported suggests that fast errors are at least 40 ms faster than correct RTs (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Logan et al., 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fitting Empirical Data</head><p>In this section, we fit the RDM to empirical data sets from <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ratcliff and Rouder (1998)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ratcliff and Smith (2004)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rae, Heathcote, Donkin, Averell, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Van Maanen et al.

In a later section, we also fit a data set with non-decision time effects, but the analysis is used to investigate differences in non-decision time estimates between popular sequential sampling models and the RDM. We also fit the LBA model because it is an established model in the field making it a useful benchmark. Furthermore, the RDM and LBA only differ in their assumption about whether to include within-trial variability or between-trial variability in drift rate, and so, comparing the two will highlight differences between within-trial and between-trial drift rate assumptions.</p><p>We adapted R code provided with <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Logan et al. (2014)</ref> and hierarchical Bayesian methods to fit the models to data. The parameters of the RDM that we estimate are v, B, A, and T er , where s is fixed to 1 unless mentioned otherwise. For all fits reported, instead of estimating b, we estimate the parameter B, which represents the difference between b and A. This prevented any starting points from being sampled above the response threshold. All other parameter variations will be discussed on a case-by-case basis in the subsequent sections. More details of our fitting procedure are presented in the Appendix.</p></div>

In experiment 1 from the paper, participants were presented with words that occurred often (high frequency), rarely (low frequency), or very rarely (very low frequency) in everyday language. Participants were also presented non-words that were generated from the high frequency, low frequency, or very low frequency words. Drift rates varied as a function of how difficult the stimuli were to classify, such that, more difficult (i.e., lower frequency words) stimuli produced lower drift rates. We replicate their drift rate finding here with the RDM.</p><p>For both the RDM and LBA models, we allowed drift rate and non-decision time to vary over stimulus difficulty, which is a recommended parameterization for lexical-decision tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Donkin, Heathcote, Brown, &amp; Andrews, 2009)</ref>, but see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Tillman, Osth, van Ravenzwaaij, &amp; Heathcote, 2017)</ref>. To summarize the empirical RT distributions, we present five quantile estimates (.1, .3, .5, .7 and .9) in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.

The authors manipulated speed and accuracy emphasis on alternating blocks of trials. Despite a similar task design to <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ratcliff and Rouder (1998)</ref>, the authors found that speed instructions, relative to accuracy instructions, not only lead to a decrease in thresholds, but a decrease in the difference between correct and error drift rates.

In general, it states that the mean RT increases linearly with the logarithm of the number of choice alternatives. If no parameters can vary over set size, then multi-accumulator models predict that the mean RT decreases and the error rate increases with the number of response options (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Logan, 1988)</ref>. In racing accumulator models, the mean RT decreases as a function of N because the observed RT distribution is made up of the minima of finishing time distributions from N accumulators. With more runners in the race there is a higher probability of sampling a faster winner (i.e., statistical facilitation; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Raab, 1962</ref>  <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> .

Note the predicted data consists of 100 separate data sets generated from the subject-level joint posterior distribution. Presented in the set size 3 panel of each model plot is the mean RT as a function of log set size, which demonstrates Hick's law. Both models capture the log-linear relationship between mean RT and set size.</p><p>Multi-accumulator models can account for Hick's law several ways. There could be normalization in evidence input to the model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Brown, Marley, Donkin, &amp; Heathcote, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hawkins, Brown, Steyvers, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2012)</ref>. For example, normalization in the RDM occurs when we constrain all the drift rates for all accumulators by having them sum to 1. It is also the case that multi-accumulator models can predict Hick's law by allowing drift rates to vary over set size <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Van Maanen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Logan et al., 2014)</ref> or by exponentially increasing response thresholds with set size <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Usher, Olami, &amp; McClelland, 2002)</ref>. The latter explanation may be contested based on neurophysiology. For instance, if we grant that accumulator models are represented by populations of pre-saccadic movement neurons in brain regions such as frontal-eye-field <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Teller, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Purcell et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Purcell, Schall, Logan, &amp; Palmeri, 2012</ref>), then we should expect the peak firing rates of frontal-eye-field movement cells to increase with set size. However, evidence from single cell recordings suggest that the movement cells reach a fixed firing rate immediately before initiating saccade responses in visual search tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hanes &amp; Schall, 1996)</ref> and the firing rates are invariant across set sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Woodman, Kang, Thompson, &amp; Schall, 2008)</ref> Variants of racing diffusion models have accounted for Hick's law in simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Leite &amp; Ratcliff, 2010)</ref> and in the stop signal paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Logan et al., 2014)</ref>. To test whether the RDM can be fit to N-choice data and can capture the log-linear relationship between RT and response alternatives, we fit a previously published <ref type="bibr">Hick</ref> and T er to vary over set size for both the RDM and LBA. Specifically, we fit the "spaced" condition from experiment 2, which was a motion dots task that required 5 participants to choose between 3, 5, 7, or 9 decision alternatives. In addition to Hick's law, we are testing whether the RDM can account for both the full distribution of RTs and accuracy rates associated with making N choice decisions.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, both the RDM and LBA can account for how accuracy, mean RT, and correct and error RT distributions change across 3, 5, 7, and 9 response alternatives. In general, both models capture the correct distributions well and only miss on the .9 quantile for error RTs. In set size 3 for the LBA, the posterior predictions for the last .9 quantile are spread out to 2.2 seconds. However, there were only 37 error RTs in that condition across all participants, and so, accurate parameter estimation is difficult. In the top right of both the set size 3 panels is mean RT plotted as a function of the logarithm of response set size. In green is the empirical data, which shows a linear increase across log set size demonstrating Hick's law. Both the RDM and LBA could predict this trend.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 10</ref>, the RDM appears to capture changes in the data and Hick's law with a decrease in correct drift rate. Unlike our other fits, the RDM estimated non-decision times lower than the LBA, but the estimates were quite varied as shown by the width of the 95% credible intervals. 3 5 7 9 3 5 7 9 3 5 7 9 3 5 7 9 </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparing Models</head><p>To compare the LBA and RDM fits we used a model selection exercise to determine what model has a better account of the empirical data. The aim here is to determine if the RDM does as well as the LBA, which is currently a successful sequential sampling model of choice RT.</p><p>One way to choose between models is to assess their "usefulness". One metric of usefulness is how well a model predicts future data. A model's ability to predict future data reflects how well the model captures the important signal (i.e., parts of the data we are interested in) in the data that is common between the current data and future data. Models that do poorly are usually either too simple, meaning that do not capture the signal, or too complex, meaning they capture the signal and noise, where the noise is not the same in future data. We used the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC Watanabe, 2010) to assess the out-of-sample predictive accuracy of the LBA and RDM. The model with the lowest WAIC has the best out-of-sample predictive accuracy and we will select between models with this metric. More details about our model selection exercise are presented in Appendix C.</p><p>The main conclusion of our model comparison was that the RDM performs at least as well as the well-known LBA model. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 2</ref> we show that the RDM is the preferred model for the <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ratcliff and Smith (2004)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rae et al. (2014)</ref> data sets and the LBA is the preferred model for the <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ratcliff and Rouder (1998)</ref>  which is a measure of goodness of fit (without a complexity penalty), show that the winning models are preferred because they better fit aspects of the data in question rather than simply being more parsimonious. In terms of parsimony, we found that the RDM was the simpler model for two of the four data sets. For some data sets, there does not appear to be complete agreement between model selection metrics and the plotted observed and predicted data. For example, in the Rouder et al. (1998) data set, the LBA model qualitatively has larger misses to the mean RT, especially for the subject KR. Despite this, the LBA model was preferred by WAIC. In <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table 2</ref> the goodness of fit, the number of effective parameters, and the WAIC values are presented, which can be used to understand this disagreement. From these values we can see that the LBA is selected due to the model having a better fit to the overall data (not just the mean RT) and because it is less complex in terms of the number of effective parameters.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Magnitude of Non-Decision Time</head><p>The results from our cross-fitting analysis suggest that the RDM systematically estimates higher non-decision times than the LBA. Because of the sparse literature on the reliability of non-decision time estimates in sequential sampling models, we fit the DDM, LBA, and RDM using hierarchical Bayesian methods to a previously published data set that found effects on non-decision time. van Ravenzwaaij, Dutilh, and Wagenmakers (2012) analyzed data from a motion dots task with the DDM and found Note. Non-decision time is in milliseconds.</p><p>that alcohol consumption increase non-decision time values. The authors concluded that alcohol impaired cognitive and motor/perceptual encoding capacity.</p><p>We calculated the non-decision time values from the median of the group-level posterior mean. As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 4</ref>, non-decision time from the DDM increased from 275 ms in placebo doses to 285 ms for high alcohol doses. 3 With the LBA, non-decision time was 162 ms for placebo doses and this decreased to 140 ms for high alcohol doses.</p><p>Therefore, if researchers had used the LBA, they would conclude that alcohol consumption does not lead to motor/perceptual encoding deterioration and that alcohol doses reduce motor/perceptual encoding time. Finally, non-decision time from the RDM increased from 251 ms in placebo doses to 256 ms for high alcohol doses, and so, researchers would conclude that alcohol had practically no effect on non-decision processes.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 14</ref> . Simulations of a single accumulator of the LBA and RDM process. The red arrows in the top left panel and the bottom two panels represents the length of time that goes by without any process finishing. Parameter values are shown in the top right panel. Note that the S parameter is the between-trial variability for the LBA and the within-trial variability for the RDM.</p><p>To learn more about the differences in non-decision time estimates from the LBA and RDM we simulated the processes of both models 100 times. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 14</ref>, we present three simulations: the RDM with no start point variability, and the LBA both with and without start point variability. The results show that the RDM without start point variability has its fastest finishing times around 100 ms, but the LBA without starting point variability has its fastest finishing times around 200 ms. If we add a non-decision time value of 100 ms to both these models then the fastest RT for the RDM will be approximately 200 ms and the LBA will be 300 ms. Thus, the LBA will need a smaller non-decision time value to produce comparable RTs to the RDM. The LBA can produce faster finishing times by increasing the starting-point variability, as shown in the bottom right panel, but this will also affect the accuracy rates of the model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Sequential sampling models account for both response times (RT) and accuracy rates in a range of different speeded decision making paradigms. These models assume decisions result from evidence accumulation to a response threshold. The models allow researchers to draw conclusions about speed of processing, caution, bias, and the time needed for perceptual encoding and motor responding. Yet, the success of these models has been dependent on auxiliary assumptions about the process components of the models varying from trial-to-trial. We argued that these between-trial variability assumptions are not founded on any process explanations and are simply added to help the models fit data. This can be problematic because the predictive ability of sequential sampling models is partly determined by distributional assumptions of between-trial variability.</p><p>To test the necessity of the between-trial variability components, we further developed a multi-accumulator race model -the racing diffusion model (RDM) -that dropped some of these assumptions and showed that it can still provide an accurate account of RT data. We showed that the RDM with only within-trial variation in drift rate can produce key response time phenomena, such as fast and slow errors relative to correct responses. The RDM was compared to the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA), which is a race model with between-trial variability in drift rates and starting points.</p><p>The RDM replaced the between-trial variability in drift rate with within-trial variability in drift rate and was able to fit data as well as the LBA, accounting for both RT and accuracy rates in tasks involving lexical decisions, brightness discriminations, motion dots, and manipulations of response set size, stimulus difficulty and speed/accuracy emphasis.</p><p>Our work questions the necessity of some between-trial variability assumptions that have become routinely assumed by sequential sampling models. Given the evidence that was provided in the introduction for between-trial variability in drift rates, starting points, and non-decision time, we will now discuss the evidence in the context of what we have found testing the RDM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence for Variability in Drift Rate</head><p>The original justification for including between-trial variability in the DDM was to account for item differences in recognition memory experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Ratcliff, 1978)</ref> and for slower errors than correct responses.</p><p>However, the RDM without between-trial variability in drift rate provides a good account of benchmark RT data. The multi-accumulator architecture naturally predicts slow errors as a consequence of the race. Furthermore, eliminating the between-trial variability in drift rate allows for a simpler likelihood equation speeding up the model fitting procedure. And so, when researchers are not interested in questions related to the between-trial variability components, then faster models such as the RDM could be an appropriate alternative. In principle, RDM could have between-trial variability in all its parameters, and it may be fruitful to develop such a model in the future if the data require it. Some of these additions have already been implemented in simple RT experiments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Tillman, Strayer, et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>More recent empirical findings, such as the double pass experiment, also provide evidence for between-trial variability in drift rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Ratcliff et al., 2018)</ref>. The problem is that these findings did not distinguish between systematic and random sources of between-trial variability in drift rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Evans et al., 2019)</ref>. For example, in the double pass experiment the same perceptual stimuli are presented at two separate trials during an experimental session and so we would assume the two drift rates for the different trials are correlated. However, the between-trial drift rate in most sequential sampling models is just a univariate normal distribution with no information about the correlation between the two drift rates of the same stimulus. The only way to capture the relationship between two instances of the same stimulus is to assign the same (or similar) drift rate to the two trials. And so, although we have evidence that drift rates are not the same across trials, this does not justify capturing between-trial variability using probability distributions that provide no additional explanation.</p><p>Infinite Model Flexibility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jones and Dzhafarov (2014)</ref> claimed that certain between-trial drift rate variability assumptions can allow infinite flexibility of sequential sampling models (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Heathcote et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Smith et al., 2014)</ref>. Our cross-fitting analysis can shed light on this claim. The only difference between the RDM with starting point variability and the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA; , is whether drift rate varies within-trial or between-trial. But what should the distributional form of this variability be?</p><p>There is a principled reason to assume that within-trial drift rate variability is Gaussian. If we assume that the random increments in the evidence accumulation process are independent, then the functional central limit theorem states that the distribution of increments converge to a Gaussian <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Donsker, 1951)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jones and Dzhafarov (2014)</ref> claim that the between-trial Gaussian distribution assumption of drift rate is simply an implementation detail in the LBA. Yet, we found that the between-trial drift variability in LBA and the within-trial drift variability in the RDM are positively linearly related. In addition to this relationship, Equation 5</p><p>(the RDM density function) is closely related to the LBA's density function, where</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">α = (b − A − tv) ts<label>(8)</label></formula><p>and</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">β = (b − tv) ts<label>(9)</label></formula><p>then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">g i (t|b, v, A) = 1 A [−vΦ(α) + sφ(α) + vΦ(β) − sφ(β)]<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where s is the standard deviation of the between-trial drift rate. Equation 5 simply LBA is a tractable proxy for speeded decision models that assume Gaussian within-trial noise, which as we argue, is justified by the functional central limit theorem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence for Variability in Starting Points</head><p>The variability in starting points allow for sequential sampling models to account for error RTs that are faster than correct RTs. The LBA also needs this source of noise to account for the speed-accuracy trade-off. Yet in the current paper, we showed that the RDM with only within-trial drift rate variability can generate fast errors of about 10ms. For errors that are much faster than correct responses, researchers can assume starting point variability in the RDM too.</p><p>In future work, researchers could attempt to systematically model some of the starting-point variability using a model such as the RDM that can do without random starting-point variability. For example, the amount of starting-point variability is likely affected by the outcomes of previous decisions -sequential effects (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jones, Curran, Mozer, &amp; Wilder, 2013)</ref>. A key limitation of many sequential sampling models is that they assume each response is independent of the next (but see , and they capture the sequential effects in the starting point variability parameter. In theory, the RDM could be used to estimate the starting point on each trial.</p></div>

A major concern is that this source of noise adds another numerical integration to the DDM equation, slowing down the model fitting process. The slowdown may not be justified given the variability in non-decision time is relatively small. The variability in non-decision time will be completely dominated by other sources of noise. For example, the standard deviation in the non-decision time is typically less than one-quarter of the standard deviation in the decision time, meaning it has little influence on the RT distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Ratcliff, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>A constant non-decision time provides a substantial computational speed up, which is one reason why a constant value is useful for the more parsimonious LBA and RDM.

In a simulation study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Donkin et al. (2011)</ref> found that the DDM reliably estimates larger non-decision times than the LBA. In practice, the DDM also typically produces higher estimates than the LBA.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In its simplest form, the RDM only has one source of variability: within-trial variability in drift rate. The simplicity of the RDM allowed us to test the necessity of between-trial variability in sequential sampling model parameters. Overall, we found good reasons to rethink including between-trial variability parameters in sequential sampling models. And at the very least, the minimal assumptions of the RDM make it a good candidate to model systematic variability in decision processes.</p><p>follows a uniform[0, A] distribution.

The lppd overestimates the model's predictive accuracy and to approximate an unbiased estimate we subtract a measure of the model's complexity from lppd. One measure of complexity is the effective number of parameters p W AIC . The effective number of parameters is a count of the total number of model parameters, but the metric accounts for the fact that all parameters in the model do not contribute to model's fit equally, and so, a parameter's contribution to the count can be values between 0 and 1.
