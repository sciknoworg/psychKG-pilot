<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>During adolescence, the ability to engage in more complex decision-making strategies increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Raab &amp; Hartley, 2019)</ref>. However, the successful use of a given decision-making strategy does not only depend on the mere ability to engage in it -it also depends on how flexible individuals are in adjusting their reliance on decision-making strategies to changes in internal and external demands. In this study, we ask how the ability for metacontrol of decision making (i.e. the dynamic adaptation of decision-making strategies) develops from adolescence into young adulthood and whether framing effects differentially affect the flexible usage of decision-making strategies in adolescents as compared to young adults.</p><p>To study metacontrol we draw on previous work that dissociates two major decision-making strategies: model-based and model-free decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Daw, Gershman, Seymour, Dayan, &amp; Dolan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dayan &amp; Niv, 2008)</ref>. Model-based decision making represents a deliberative, prospective strategy that evaluates different choice options by means of forward planning based on knowledge about the structure of the environment (a cognitive model). In contrast, modelfree decision making represents a more reflexive, retrospective strategy that relies on previously experienced action-reward contingencies. Previous developmental research shows that the reliance on model-based decision making (but not model-free decision making) becomes more pronounced from childhood to adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Decker, Otto, Daw, &amp; Hartley, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Potter, Bryce, &amp; Hartley, 2017)</ref> and these findings mirror the development of executive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Munakata, Snyder, &amp; Chatham, 2012)</ref> which model-based decision making is thought to rely on <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Otto, Gershman, Markman, &amp; Daw, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Otto, Skatova, Madlon-Kay, &amp; Daw, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Due to this reliance on executive functions, model-based decision making is effortful and carries an intrinsic cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kool, McGuire, Rosen, &amp; Botvinick, 2010)</ref>. In return, it provides a higher behavioral flexibility than model-free decision making because dynamic changes in the environment can be accounted for more quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dayan &amp; Niv, 2008)</ref>. Recent theories of metacontrol have proposed that humans weigh the cost and benefits associated with a decisionmaking strategy against each other when controlling their reliance on these strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kool, Cushman, &amp; Gershman, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2017)</ref>. According to this view, the cognitive effort associated with employing model-based decision making therefore needs to be matched by sufficiently high benefits. This is in line with findings demonstrating that adults show increased reliance on model-based decision making when stakes are high; thus obtaining a higher monetary pay-off when engaging in a model-based decision-making strategy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kool, Gershman, &amp; Cushman, 2017)</ref>. Conversely, the engagement in model-based decision making is reduced when the task at hand gets more complex and thus this strategy becomes cognitively more effortful <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bolenz, Kool, Reiter, &amp; Eppinger, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Eppinger, Walter, &amp; Li, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kool, Gershman, &amp; Cushman, 2018)</ref>. Since the strategic adaptation of physical and cognitive effort improves from adolescence into adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Insel, Kastman, Glenn, &amp; Somerville, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rodman et al., 2019)</ref>, metacontrol of decision making may improve with increasing age.</p><p>So far, research on the interplay of model-free and model-based decision-making strategies has almost exclusively focused on decisions in the gain domain. The initial work on the dissociation of model-free and model-based decision making used rewards as outcomes to reinforce behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Daw et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gläscher, Daw, Dayan, &amp; O'Doherty, 2010)</ref> and the studies on metacontrol applied rewards of varying magnitudes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kool et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kool et al., 2018)</ref>. This focus on decisions in the gain domain is surprising given behavioral and neuroscientific studies emphasizing the role of outcome valence in decision making, i.e. the framing of outcomes as gains or losses. Losses carry a higher subjective weight than gains in decisions under risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981)</ref> and losses have been associated with a greater allocation of cognitive resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Yechiam &amp; Hochman, 2013)</ref>. Evidence from neuroscience studies supports the idea of dissociable mechanisms involved in decisions in the gain domain compared to the loss domain. For example, electrophysiological and neuroimaging work point to a unique role of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in the processing of monetary loss as well as in mediating effortful behavioral adjustments in response to negative feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fischer &amp; Ullsperger, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Holroyd et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ullsperger, Danielmeier, &amp; Jocham, 2014)</ref>. Taken together, these findings suggest that losses may bias the cost-benefit evaluations underlying metacontrol and point to partially dissociable cognitive and neural processes underlying decisions in the gain and loss domain.</p><p>The potential impact of losses on decision making is interesting from a developmental perspective because of several findings that suggest that the neural systems involved in the processing of loss outcomes and the associated behavioral adaptations continue to develop into adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Crone &amp; Steinbeis, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kelly et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rubia et al., 2006)</ref>. The question whether adolescents and adults differ in how they attribute subjective weight to losses as compared to gains is not fully answered. Results of a developmental neuroimaging study on loss aversion during descriptive decision making show differences in fronto-striatal activation during decision making between adolescents and adults but no differences in behavioral preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Barkley-Levenson, Van Leijenhorst, &amp; Galvan, 2013)</ref>. In contrast, results from studies using the Iowa Gambling Task suggest that performance deficits in children and adolescents may result from a disproportionate tendency to shift behavior after receiving loss feedback when compared to young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cassotti, Houde, &amp; Moutier, 2011)</ref>. Moreover, several studies have reported different developmental trajectories for gains as compared to losses with respect to effects on behavior and neural processing. For example, the neural sensitivity for differences in monetary outcomes follows independent developmental curves during adolescence in gains versus loss contexts  and adolescents show a stronger asymmetry between gains and loss than adults during probabilistic reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Palminteri, Kilford, Coricelli, &amp; Blakemore, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we investigated metacontrol and its susceptibility to framing effect across development from adolescence to young adulthood by means of a decision-making task that dissociates modelfree and model-based decision making. In this task, we manipulated outcome magnitude (low vs. high) and outcome valence (gains vs. losses). We expected that with increasing age, participants would show more metacontrol with respect to different outcome magnitudes and that the development of metacontrol differs between gain and loss contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We used a sequential decision-making task (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kool, Cushman, and Gershman (2016))</ref> to determine reliance on model-free and model-based decision making in a sample of 97 adolescents (12-17 years) and 104 adults (18-25 years; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> for age distribution). In this task, participants make repeated decisions between two spaceships -either between an orange and a turquoise spaceship or between a blue and a green spaceship. Each spaceship deterministically leads to one of two planets where the participants obtain a number of outcomes (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2A</ref>). The number of outcomes drifts over the course of the experiment (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2A</ref>). To understand how model-free and model-based decision making differ in this task, consider that a model-free decision-maker makes choices based on an independent reward expectation for each of the four spaceships. In contrast, a model-based decision-maker predicts the planet to which a spaceship will lead and uses the reward expectation associated with this planet to guide choices. Crucially, because multiple spaceships lead to one planet, the model-based decisionmaker can integrate over experiences with different spaceships.</p><p>To investigate how the framing of outcomes affects model-based decision making, we manipulated the outcome valence across blocks of trials: In some blocks, outcomes were framed as gains ("space treasure") and participants were instructed to maximize reward. In other blocks, outcomes were framed as losses ("antimatter") and participants were instructed to avoid losing.</p><p>Moreover, similar to previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kool et al., 2017)</ref>, we manipulated how many points were at stake in each trial: In low-stakes trials, participants gained/lost one point for each outcome they had collected and in high-stakes trials participants gained/lost five points for each outcome ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>). To analyze how reliance on model-based decision making differed between experimental conditions and across development, we used a hierarchical Bayesian version of an established reinforcement-learning model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Daw et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kool et al., 2016)</ref>. In our analyses, we focused on the model-based weight parameter that reflects the degree to which choices are guided by model-based decision making (for results regarding model-free weights, see <ref type="table">Table S1</ref>-S2 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref> in the supplementary information). We used two variants of the reinforcement-learning model, a non-developmental model and a developmental model. In the non-developmental model, model-based weights were regressed on stakes condition and valence condition; thus, regression weights reflect the effects of the experimental manipulation across all participants regardless of age. In the developmental model, model-based weights were regressed on stakes condition, valence condition and participants' age, which allows to test how model-based weights and the effects of the experimental conditions change across development. We will report results from the developmental model for all regression weights that relate to age and from the nondevelopmental model otherwise.</p><p>We will first report analyses on developmental changes in model-based decision making. As a second step, we will turn to developmental changes in stakes-based metacontrol, that is in the adaptation of model-based decision making to differences in outcome magnitudes. Third, we will present the effects of outcome valence on model-based decision making and metacontrol and how these effects changed with development. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of stakes-based metacontrol</head><p>Across all participants, we found increased model-based weights for high-stakes trials compared to low-stakes trials (b = 0.09, CI = [0.07, 0.12]; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). Consistent with previous nondevelopmental studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kool et al., 2017)</ref>, this indicates that participants showed stakesbased metacontrol, i.e. they adapted their reliance on model-based decision making to differences in outcome magnitudes. Separate analyses for adolescents and adults showed stakesbased metacontrol in both age groups (see <ref type="table">Table S3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2</ref> in the supplementary information).</p><p>To investigate whether stakes-based metacontrol changes across adolescence, we analyzed stakes effects as a function of age. We found that the stakes effect increased with age (bage×stakes  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Valence bias in metacontrol</head><p>Across all participants, we found higher model-based weights in loss blocks compared to gain blocks (bvalence = -0.03, CI = [-0.05, -0.01]; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>). This indicates that participants relied more on model-based decision making when outcomes were framed as losses than when outcomes were framed as gains. Moreover, we found an interaction of stakes condition and valence condition (bstakes×valence = 0.06, CI = [0.03, 0.09]), indicating that the effect of outcome valence differed between low-stakes trials and high-stakes trials. While we found increased model-based weights in loss blocks compared to gain blocks for low-stakes trials (bvalence(low) = -0.06, CI = [-0.08, -0.03]), we did not find evidence for a valence effect for high-stakes trials (bvalence(high) = 0.00, CI = [-0.02, 0.02]). Thus, loss-induced increases of model-based decision making were particularly pronounced in trials with low outcome magnitudes. Separate analyses for adolescents and adults indicated interactions of stakes condition and valence condition in both age groups (see <ref type="table">Table S3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S2</ref> in the supplementary information).</p><p>In order to examine developmental differences in how gains and losses affect model-based decision making, we analyzed the effect of outcome valence as well as the interaction of stakes condition and valence condition as a function of age. We did not find evidence for an age-related change in the effect of outcome valence on model-based weights (bage×valence = 0.02, CI = [-0.03, 0.07], 82.0% of the posterior mass above 0). Moreover, there was no evidence for an age-related change in the interaction of stakes condition and valence condition (bage×stakes×valence = -0.02, CI = [-0.11, 0.08], 34.3% of the posterior mass below 0). Thus, we did not find developmental differences in the asymmetry of gains and loss with respect to metacontrol of decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we investigated the development of metacontrol of decision making across adolescence. Specifically, we asked how the adaptation of model-based decision making toward different outcome magnitudes changes from adolescence into young adulthood and whether metacontrol in adolescents and adults is differentially sensitive to framing effects. We show that model-based decision making and its adaptation toward different outcome magnitudes (stakesbased metacontrol) improves with age. We also show that metacontrol of decision making is sensitive to outcome valence, i.e. the framing of outcomes as gains or losses. However, we do not find evidence for developmental differences in this valence bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of model-based decision making</head><p>The reliance on model-based decision making increased across adolescence. This finding is consistent with results of previous work that has shown an age-related increase in model-based decision making from childhood (age 8 years) to young adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Decker et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Potter et al., 2017)</ref>. Going beyond these findings, we observe developmental differences in model-based decision making in a more constrained age range. Thus, the current data suggest that modelbased decision making is a truly late-developing capacity that continues to develop into early adulthood. This could be linked to the protracted maturation of prefrontal brain regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Casey, Tottenham, Liston, &amp; Durston, 2005)</ref>, which are implicated in model-based decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gläscher et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Huang, Yaple, &amp; Yu, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Smittenaar, FitzGerald, Romei, Wright, &amp; Dolan, 2013</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of stakes-based metacontrol</head><p>Both adolescents and adults showed stakes-based metacontrol, that is they adapted their reliance on model-based decision making toward the different outcome magnitudes. However, stakesbased metacontrol became more pronounced with age across adolescence: Older participants showed stronger increases in model-based decision making when outcomes were amplified. This finding extends the results from a recent study reporting that stakes-based metacontrol increased with age in five-to eleven-year-old children <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Smid, Kool, Hauser, &amp; Steinbeis, 2020)</ref>, an age range which is adjacent to our study. Furthermore, the increased adaptation of model-based decision making parallels findings that the strategic adaptation of physical and cognitive effort toward different reward magnitudes improves from adolescence into adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Insel et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rodman et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>We interpret this result as showing that the ability for metacontrol continues to develop during adolescence. Together with studies in other age groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bolenz et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Smid et al., 2020)</ref>, this suggests that metacontrol of decision making is a cognitive process which is subject to dynamic developmental changes across the lifespan. However, one could also think of potential alternative interpretations for these developmental differences. First, less adaptation of modelbased decision making toward different outcome magnitudes might be explained by an attenuated sensitivity to differences in outcomes; that is, the difference in subjective values for low-stakes and high-stakes outcomes might be reduced for adolescents. However, findings from neuroimaging studies speak against this interpretation by showing an increased sensitivity for differences in rewards in adolescents . Second, the reduced capacity for model-based decision making in younger participants might have constrained the degree to which adaptation is possible. This would mirror suggestions that higher incentives only boost performance when the task demands match an individual's cognitive capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Davidow, Insel, &amp; Somerville, 2018)</ref>. However, we did not find that participants who showed more model-based decision making also showed more stakes-based metacontrol. Thus, these findings suggest that the development of model-based decision making is independent from the development of stakes-based metacontrol. This is in line with findings that varying the difficulty of cognitivecontrol tasks does not necessarily affect the adaptation of cognitive effort (Devine et al., in prep.), suggesting that the adaptation of effort is to some degree independent from one's capacity for the task. A dissociated development of model-based decision making and metacontrol is also consistent with the view that different brain regions underlie these two cognitive functions: While prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are assumed to be implicated in model-based decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gläscher et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Huang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Smittenaar et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vikbladh et al., 2019)</ref>, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex has been proposed to be involved in the implementation of cost-benefit evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Shenhav, Botvinick, &amp; Cohen, 2013)</ref> that are considered to underlie metacontrol <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kool et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kool et al., 2017)</ref>. We therefore think that our finding is best explained by a process-specific, age-related improvement of metacontrol. Future research should shed more light on the neurodevelopmental trajectories that underlie age-related changes in metacontrol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Valence bias in metacontrol</head><p>When avoiding losses, participants showed more reliance on model-based decision making than when seeking gains. It is commonly assumed that losses carry a higher subjective weight than gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981)</ref>. This higher subjective weight of losses might increase the expected benefit of investing in an effortful decision-making strategy and thus affect cost-benefit evaluations that have been hypothesized to underlie metacontrol of decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kool et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kool et al., 2017)</ref>. In short, the motivation to avoid losses makes people allocate more cognitive resources to a more accurate but also more demanding decision-making strategy.</p><p>Previous studies have reported valence effects on model-based decision making in psychiatric patients or under pharmacological interventions but not in healthy or placebo controls <ref type="bibr">(Voon et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Worbe et al., 2016)</ref>. Importantly, these findings were based on a different decisionmaking task <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Daw et al., 2011</ref>) that has been questioned to elicit metacontrol <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kool et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kool et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, the valence effects reported in these studies might not be reflective of an actual modulation of metacontrol but might represent more general effects associated with altered psychiatric or physiological conditions. In contrast, by using a task that previously has been shown to elicit metacontrol (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kool et al., 2017)</ref> and by testing a sample of healthy participants, our study provides evidence that outcome valence typically modulates model-based decision making and its metacontrol.</p><p>We observed a valence bias when outcome magnitude was low but not when outcomes were amplified. One possible explanation for this differentiation could be that participants show ceiling performance already for high-stakes trials during gain blocks and thus might not be able to further increase model-based decision making when outcomes are framed as losses. In this case, a valence bias should also arise in high-stakes trials when making the task more demanding because higher costs would lead to a more selective use of model-based decision making.</p><p>Contrary to our expectations, we did not find developmental differences in this valence bias.</p><p>While previous studies have reported independent developmental trajectories for processing gains and losses  and stronger valence-related asymmetries for learning in adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Palminteri et al., 2016)</ref>, our results might suggest that these developmental effects are not necessarily reflected in higher-order decision-making processes. However, our task design also differed in some aspects from previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Palminteri et al., 2016)</ref>: For instance, we employed a blockwise manipulation of outcome valence while in these other studies, the framing of outcomes as gains or losses changed between single trials. It remains a question for future research how these differences in task design might affect behavior in adolescents and adults.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In this study, we found that metacontrol continues to develop from adolescence into young adulthood. With increasing age, participants showed more adaptation of model-based decision making toward different outcome magnitudes. Moreover, metacontrol was sensitive to outcome valence: When outcomes were framed as losses, participants showed a greater willingness to engage in the cognitively more demanding, model-based decision-making strategy. However, contrary to our predictions, we did not find evidence for developmental differences in this valence bias, indicating that framing effects had a similar impact on the adjustment of decision strategies in adolescents and young adults.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>97 adolescents (50 female, mean age: 14.5 years, age range: 12 to 17 years) and 104 adults (61 female, mean age: 21.3 years, age range: 18 to 25 years) took part in this study. We aimed for a larger sample size than previous developmental studies on model-based decision making because of our intention to investigate interaction effects and because we expected generally weaker effects due to the more restricted age range. The target sample size of around 200 participants was determined based on feasibility considerations. No participant was excluded from data analysis. Participants' age followed an approximately uniform distribution within the age range <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1)</ref>. We compensated participants with 5 € per hour or course credit as a baseline compensation and with an additional performance-dependent bonus payment of 7 cents per 100 points in the sequential decision-making task (range: 3.99 € to 5.46 €). Beside the sequential decision-making task, participants also completed a task battery including a cognitive-control task and a risk-preference task as well as questionnaires on impulsivity, cognitive effort investment and real-world risk taking, but we do not report analyses on these data here. All participants and the parents of all underage participants provided written informed consent. The ethics committee of Technische Universität Dresden approved the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sequential decision-making task</head><p>We adapted a sequential decision-making task used in previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kool et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kool et al., 2017)</ref> that dissociates model-free and model-based decision making. Every trial started with an inter-trial interval (black screen, 300 ms) after which a stakes cue was presented ("1x" or "5x", randomly chosen with equal probability, 800 ms) that indicated the stakes condition of the current trial. Then, one of two first-stage states was presented showing two spaceships side by side (an orange and a turquoise spaceship or a blue and a green spaceship, randomly chosen with equal probability, 1500 ms). Participants selected one of the two spaceships using the F and J keys on a standard computer keyboard for the left and the right spaceship, respectively, with the side on which the spaceship appeared being balanced across the task in both first-stage states.</p><p>Contingent on their choice, one of two second-stage states was presented subsequently (a red or a purple planet with a corresponding alien, 1500 ms). In each first-stage state, one spaceship deterministically led to the red planet and the other spaceship deterministically led to the purple planet with a fixed mapping between spaceships and planets throughout the task. Participants responded in the second-stage state by pressing the space bar. After this, the outcomes received in this trial were presented above the alien ("space treasure" or "antimatter", depending on the valence condition, 800 ms). The number of outcomes available at the two planets was determined by independent Gaussian random walks (mean = 0, standard deviation = 2, reflecting boundaries at 0 and 9, values rounded to integers) for each block of trials. At the end of the trial, the presentation of received outcomes was replaced with a presentation of points obtained in this trial (depending on the number of outcomes, valence condition and stakes condition, 800 ms). A point count was displayed in the top-right corner of the screen during each block.</p><p>The task consisted of 480 trials divided into eight blocks of 60 trials. We varied outcome valence between blocks in alternating order and participants were informed about the upcoming valence condition before the start of each block. In gain blocks, the outcomes available at the two planets were presented as "space treasure" and participants gained points with every piece of outcome.</p><p>In loss blocks, outcomes were presented as "antimatter" and participants lost points with every piece of outcome. Participants were instructed to seek as many outcomes as possible during gain blocks but to avoid as many outcomes as possible during loss blocks. To keep the overall payoff comparable between gain blocks and loss blocks, participants started each loss block with 1600 points and each gain block with 0 points. Moreover, we manipulated between trials how outcomes were converted into points. In lowstakes trials, participants gained one point for each piece of space treasure and lost one point for each piece of antimatter. In high-stakes trials, the value of outcomes was amplified: Participants gained five points for each piece of space treasure and lost five points for each piece of antimatter. This stakes manipulation has previously been shown to induce metacontrol of modelbased decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kool et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The timing of trials was constant irrespective of how fast participants responded during the firststage state or the second-stage state. Thus, participants could not increase their reward rate over time by responding faster. As soon as a response was given, the selected option was highlighted for the remaining time of presentation. If no response was given during the presentation of the first-stage state or the second-stage state, the trial was canceled and the task proceeded with the next trial. In trials with missing responses, points were calculated based on the stakes condition of the trial and the worst possible number of outcomes given the respective valence condition (0 pieces of space treasure in gain blocks or 9 pieces of antimatter in loss blocks). Therefore, it was not possible to avoid losing points simply by not responding during loss blocks. We excluded all trials with missing responses from analysis (2.1% of all trials).</p><p>To reduce variability between participants due to differences in the task, we created four different trial sequences that determined the sequence of first-stage states, number of outcomes available at the two planets, sequence of stakes conditions and sequence of valence conditions. The sequence of first-stage states and the number of available outcomes was identical for all four trial sequences. Stakes conditions and valence conditions were counterbalanced across trial sequences. We assigned these four trial sequences in a balanced way to participants across the age range. Prior to starting the task, participants received extensive training on the outcome distribution, the mapping between spaceships and planets as well as the stakes manipulation. To ensure that participants understood of the mapping between spaceships and planets, they needed to correctly select the spaceship leading to a given planet ten times in a row before being able to proceed. To ensure that participants understood the stakes manipulation, they needed to correctly report the number of points given a stakes cue and a number of outcomes ten times in a row before being able to proceed. Furthermore, participants completed 15 practice trials in the gain condition and 15 practice trials in the loss condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reinforcement-learning model</head><p>To identify reliance on different decision-making strategies, we used an established reinforcement-learning model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Daw et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kool et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Otto, Raio, Chiang, Phelps, &amp; Daw, 2013)</ref>. This model maintains model-free and model-based reward expectations, QMF <ref type="bibr">(si,ai)</ref> and QMB(si,ai) respectively, for each available action ai in every state si at the i-th stage of the task and both reward expectations can guide choice behavior. Note that while first-stage states have two available actions (selecting one of the two spaceships), second-stage states have only one action available (accepting to receive the outcome).</p><p>Model-free reward expectations. At the beginning of a block, we set all model-free reward expectations to QMF(si,ai) = 4.5 for gain blocks and to QMF(si,ai) = -4.5 for loss blocks thereby assuming an average model-free reward expectations before any information on the outcomes had been observed. After experiencing the consequences of a choice (i.e., obtaining outcomes or transitioning to a new state), all model-free reward expectations were updated according to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Q MF (s , a i ) ← Q MF (s i , a i ) + × ( , ) ×</formula><p>Here, α is the reward learning rate (ranging between 0 and 1) that determines how strongly the model-free reward expectation is shifted toward the most recent experiences. The eligibility trace e(si,ai) grades which state-action pairs are eligible for updating.</p><p>At the beginning of a trial, e(si,ai) was set to 0 for all state-action pairs; before updating modelfree reward expectations, the eligibility trace for the immediately preceding state-action pair (si',ai') was set to 1 and after updating, all eligibility traces were decayed by the eligibility trace parameter λ (bounded between 0 and 1). By means of this, model-free reward expectations in the first-stage state could be updated twice in a trial: first, directly after moving from the firststage state to the second-stage state and second, after obtaining the outcome at the end of the trial.</p><p>The reward prediction error δ is computed as the difference between the expected reward (given by the reward expectation for the immediately preceding state-action pair) and the actually experienced reward (which is the sum of the immediately obtained reward r and the predicted future reward in the new state, given by the reward expectation for the following state-action pair):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">δ = r + Q MF ( +1 ′, a +1 ′) − Q MF (s ′ , a i ′)</formula><p>Note that r = 0 after first-stage choice because there is no immediate reward in second-stage states and QMF(si+1',ai+1') = 0 after second-stage choices because reward states are considered terminal.</p><p>Model-based reward expectations. Model-based reward expectations at the first stage are based on the reward expectations associated with the second-stage state to which a first-stage choice will lead. Formally, this is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( 1 , 1 ) = ∑ ( 2 | 1 , 1 ) ( 2 ,<label>2 2 )</label></formula><p>Here, T reflects transition probabilities according to the task structure with T(s2|s1,a1) = 1 if selection a1 in s1 will lead to s2 and T(s2|s1,a1) = 0 otherwise. By means of these transition probabilities, model-based decision making incorporates knowledge about the task structure (i.e., a model of the task).</p><p>Model-based reward expectations at the second stage are identical to model-free reward expectations because both reflect an estimate of the immediate outcome.</p><p>Choice rule. The probability for selecting a particular action in a given first-stage state P(a1'|s1') was modeled with a softmax function that takes into account model-free and model-based reward expectations as well as perseverative tendencies.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( 1 ′| 1 ′) = exp( ( 1 ′, 1 ′) + ( 1 ′, 1 ′) + × ( 1 ′) + × ( 1 ′)) ∑ exp( ( 1 ′, 1 ) + ( 1 ′, 1 ) + × ( 1 ) + × ( 1 )) 1</formula><p>The choice stickiness parameter π (unbounded) and the response stickiness parameter ρ (unbounded) capture repeating or switching behavior (positive or negative values, respectively) of choices (selection of a spaceship) and responses (key presses). The indicator variable rep(a1')</p><p>is set to 1 when a1' was the action selected in the previous trial (and 0 otherwise). The indicator variable resp(a1') is set to 1 when selecting a1' requires the same key press as in the previous trial (and 0 otherwise).</p><p>The model-free weight and the model-based weight, βMF and βMB respectively, are unbounded parameters that reflect the degree to which decision making is guided by either strategy. Note that while more conventional formulations of the reinforcement-learning model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Daw et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kool et al., 2017</ref>) use a single weighting parameter that reflects the relative influence of model-based versus model-free decision making, the formulation we use here is algebraically equivalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Otto, Raio, et al., 2013)</ref> and comes with less bounded parameters which facilitates hierarchical model-fitting.</p><p>We fitted two variants of the reinforcement-learning model to the behavioral data. First, we fitted a non-developmental model in order to investigate differences in model-free and model-based decision making between the experimental conditions across all participants regardless of age. In this model variant, we regressed model-free and model-based weights on stakes condition, valence condition and their interaction (here illustrated for the model-based weight, the same procedure applies to the model-free weight):</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= 0 + + + ×</formula><p>We used effect coding for the categorical variables (xstakes = -0.5 for low-stakes trials and xstakes = 0.5 for high-stakes trials; xvalence = 0.5 for gain blocks and xvalence = -0.5 for loss blocks). By means of this coding style, we can interpret b0 as average model-based weight across all conditions and bstakes, bvalence and bstakes×valence as main and interaction effects similar to an analysis of variance.</p><p>To analyze developmental effects, we also used an extended version of this model. In this developmental model, model-free and model-based weights were regressed on stakes condition, valence condition, age (scaled to the range [0, 1]) and all potential two-way and three-way interactions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">= 0 + + + × + ( + × + × + × × )</formula><p>In the developmental model, b0, bstakes, bvalence and bstakes×valence can be interpreted as the mean, the main effect and the interaction effect for participants at the lower bound of the age range while bage, bstakes×age, bvalence×age and bstakes×valence×age represent how the mean, the main effects and the interaction effect change when moving from the lower bound to the upper bound of the age range. We report results from the developmental model for all effects that include age (bage, bstakes×age, bvalence×age and bstakes×valence×age) and from the non-developmental model otherwise (b0, bstakes, bvalence and bstakes×valence).</p><p>Model-fitting procedure. We fitted a hierarchical Bayesian version of the reinforcement-learning model to the behavioral data using the probabilistic programming language Stan via the RStan package (Stan Development Team, 2018). All participant-level parameters were modeled as being drawn from a group-level distribution. Reward learning rate, the choice stickiness parameter and the response stickiness parameter were estimated separately for gain and loss blocks and we transformed bounded parameters (reward learning rate) to logit space. Participant-level parameters for these model parameters were modeled as being drawn from independent, univariate normal distribution with a group-level mean and a group-level standard deviation (e.g., πgain ~ N(μπ_gain, σπ_gain) or logit(αgain) ~ N(μlogit(α_gain), σlogit(α_gain)). To reduce model complexity, the eligibility trace parameter was set to λ = 1 and our results remain qualitatively unaffected when assuming other values for this parameter (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table S4</ref>-S5 in the supplementary information).</p><p>The linear combination weights ⃗ = (b0, bstakes, bvalence, bstakes×valence) that determine model-based weights were modeled as being drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with a vector of group-level means and a group level covariance matrix ( ⃗ ~ N( b, Σb) with Σb = DΡD, where Ρ is a correlation matrix and D is a diagonal matrix with diag(D) = b). The identical procedure applied to linear combination weights for the model-free weights.</p><p>For all group-level means, we used Normal(0,1) priors. For all group-level standard deviations, we used Normal(0,2) priors. For correlations, we used LKJ(2) priors. For the developmental parameters (bage, bstakes×age, bvalence×age and bstakes×valence×age), we used Normal(0,1) priors.</p><p>We ran four independent chains of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure with 4000 iterations each and discarded the first 2000 iterations of each chain as warm-up. We assessed the convergence of all chains via the Gelman-Rubin statistic (̂ &lt; 1.1) for all parameters and ensured that bulk and tail effective sample size was sufficiently high (&gt; 400) for all parameters.</p><p>When presenting group-level parameters, we report means and 95% credible intervals of the marginal distributions. Credible intervals are computed as the <ref type="bibr">[.025, .975</ref>] percentile interval and can be interpreted as including the true value of the parameter of interest with a probability of 95%. When presenting participant-level parameters, we report means of the marginal participant-level distributions.</p></div>

Development of model-based decision making Across conditions, model-based weights increased with age (bage = 0.21, credible interval (CI) = [0.12, 0.30]). Separate analyses showed age-related increases in model-based weights for all experimental conditions (Figure 3; bage(low, gain) = 0.19, CI = [0.09, 0.30]; bage(high, gain) = 0.25, CI = [0.15, 0.35]; bage(low, loss) = 0.16, CI = [0.06, 0.26]; bage(high, loss) = 0.24, CI = [0.13, 0.34]).

Furthermore, separate analyses for gain and loss blocks showed at least moderate evidence for age-related increases in stakes effects for both valence conditions (bage×stakes(gain) = 0.06, CI = [-0.03, 0.15], 88.4% of the posterior mass above 0; bage×stakes(loss) = 0.08, CI = [-0.02, 0.17], 94.2% of the posterior mass above 0). These results show that metacontrol of decision making becomes more pronounced with age across adolescence.As metacontrol could be related to the ability to engage in model-based decision-making (i.e., younger participants could show less metacontrol because they are generally more constrained in their ability to engage in model-based decision making), we analyzed if higher overall reliance on model-based decision making correlated with metacontrol. Our results show that there was no or at most only a small positive correlation between mean model-based weights and stakes effects (r = -0.03, CI = [-0.20, 0.13], 35.8% of the posterior mass above 0;Figure 4). This suggests that increases in metacontrol do not necessarily result from a greater ability to engage in modelbased decision making.</figDesc></figure>
