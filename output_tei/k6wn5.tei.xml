<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main</head><p>Cooperative behaviour is central to most human enterprises, and it is a cornerstone of human societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . Studies suggest that a rudimental and intuitive moral sense is present already in the first year of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and a spontaneous proclivity toward altruism, fairness and cooperation can be detected already in toddlerhood, although limited or constrained by several biases such as ingroup and familiarity preferences that hinder impartiality to some extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . In adults, prosociality as an impulse or instinct rather than a self-reflected process is in line with applied findings from economic games that have been used to measure cooperation, overall suggesting that humans are intuitively cooperative rather than intuitively selfish <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . In one-shot public goods games, forcing participants (in particular young adults between 20 and 30 years of age) to decide quickly has been shown to increase rather than decrease cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</p><p>A possibility put forward to explain these latter findings is that humans are either equipped with or gradually develop fast and effortless cooperative heuristics, which are rational and shaped by previous experience, for instance learning that cooperating can often be payoff-maximizing in the long run <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . In one-shot games though, to cooperate is not the payoff-maximizing strategy, since participants will not encounter their partners again <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . In such scenarios, a more controlled and slow response often leads participants to rationally act more selfishly <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Deutchman &amp; Sullivan, 2018)</ref>. Several key elements of this proposed theory remain unclear and untested including the possibility that cooperative heuristics may change over the lifespan and may thus be shaped by experience which is then internalized through expectations about how others will likely respond to cooperation or defection.</p><p>Our analysis explores whether and how cooperative heuristics change throughout the lifespan, from early adolescence to old age, as assessed in a one-shot public goods game (PGG) played under time pressure or time delay. If it is true that cooperation results from the overgeneralization of intuitive heuristics that are internalised from experience and applied to new contexts, one might expect to see changes in cooperative behaviour throughout the lifespan, as individuals gain more social experience with age, or simply hold different expectations about others' relevant behaviour depending on their stage of development (e.g. adolescence vs old age). In particular, one might expect to observe changes in the intuition for cooperation across the lifespan, whereas deliberate cooperation should be relatively less affected.</p><p>To observe whether the social heuristics fostering prosocial behaviour apply to altruism too, participants were asked to play a one-shot dictator game (DG), again under time pressure or time delay. This allowed us to test whether and to what extent intuition and deliberation contribute differently to the shaping of cooperative and altruistic behaviour.</p><p>Finally, the analysis also investigated the role of social expectations and reciprocity in shaping cooperative behaviour, by asking participants to report how much they thought the other two (fictitious) partners had contributed, and in a subsequent task, by manipulating the knowledge participants had about the partners' contributions. The role of attitudes to risk, general optimism, and the need to be socially accepted were also analysed as potential sources of cooperative behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Becoming Intuitive Cooperators</head><p>In Public Goods Games (PGGs), both Nash and dominant strategy equilibrium behaviour require players to free ride to maximise their short-term monetary payoff. However, cognitive accounts have shown that people's decisions are influenced by social heuristics -intuitive judgments that are less cognitively costly than deliberate reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . Whereas deliberation is flexible in nature, intuition is not and seems to support cooperation rather than selfishness in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . If cooperation is an evolved strategy built in humans as an intuitive response, then one may expect it to be stably present across the lifespan, at least after childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . To test the stability across the lifespan of the intuition for cooperation, participants were asked to play a one-shot PGG, under two different time conditions. In the time-pressure condition, participants had only 10 seconds to respond, whereas in the time-delay condition, participants were forced to deliberate on their choice for at least 10 seconds, after which they had 20 seconds to respond. These two conditions were selected, as in prior work, to provide insight into the intuitive and reflective (deliberative) processes underlying participants' choices. Forcing participants to respond quickly should elicit intuitive responses, whereas forcing them to respond slowly should elicit reflective reasoning. In the PGG, each participant was matched with two other fictitious partners, received four lottery tickets (granting the possibility to win a monetary prize), and had to decide how many tickets to contribute to a common fund. The total amount of tickets placed in the common fund was then to be doubled and divided evenly among the three players. Raw data, videos and supplementary material can be found online <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> .</p><p>Our main empirical model specification exploits a conventional ordered Probit approach a to estimate the likelihood of contributing any number ∈ {0,1, … ,4} of lottery tickets as a function of age, time condition (time-pressure vs time-delay), and the interaction between time condition and age. The coefficient on the second regressor (parameter b in specification (i)) estimates differences in intercepts between the time-pressure and the time-delay group, whereas the coefficient on the third regressor (parameter c in specification (i)) estimates differences in slopes across the two groups (as displayed by the OLS regression lines in Panel b of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Because the regressions lines for the time-pressure and time-delay groups were close on parts of the support due to their intersection, in the interaction term of our main specification, age was parsed into four categories: adolescents <ref type="bibr">(12-19 years)</ref>, young adults (20-30 years), adults (31-60 years), and older adults (61-79 years). This also allowed us to investigate impacts of stages of development rather than age as, although these concepts are closely related, our research question centres on the former. Specifically, we run the following ordered Probit regressions: The main finding of the study, as captured in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1b)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= + * + * + * * (i)</formula><p>Although age had an overall positive effect on contributions for all participants in the timepressure condition, intuitive cooperation, as predicted by prior work (that is, more cooperation under time-pressure than under time-delay; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11 )</ref>, was not present in all age groups in specifications (ii) and (iii). It was absent in adolescents and adults, but present in young adults and in the older adults <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figures 1c and 1d</ref>). Interestingly, a reversed pattern was found in adolescents, in that they behaved more selfishly under time-pressure than when given time to reflect. Notably, whereas when aggregating across age groups we replicated prior findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> this was not the case for adolescents, for whom intuition favoured selfishness, or for adults, whose contributions were unaffected by time condition. Further, as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref> and 1d, adults were the age group contributing the most to the public good under both time conditions, suggesting that with maturity, individuals internalize the benefits of cooperation in both intuitive and reflective processes. <ref type="bibr">b</ref> In Ordered Probit regressions, the omitted dependent variable is estimated so that it is worth 0 when all regressors are worth 0, meaning that constant terms are normalized to 0 in all Probit regressions.  </p><p>Note. The ordered Probit approach transforms the discrete dependent variable in a continuous one, and the rows in the table labelled Contribute X represent different cut-offs for the transformed dependent variable above which participants contribute more than X tickets and below which they contribute less than X tickets. Our key specification, (iii), displays a significant coefficient for almost all parameters and underlies the graphical representation provided in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1d</ref>. Qualitatively similar results hold when age is dropped as an explanatory variable, in specification (ii). However, many coefficients lose significance, as interaction terms are less precisely estimated when accounting also for the age variation in PGG contributions within age groups. When age is treated as a continuous variable in the interaction term, contributions of those under time-delay do not vary with age while contributions of those under time pressure increase significantly with age, but the p-value on the coefficients being statistically different is only .14.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">+ p &lt; .15, * p &lt; .05, ** p &lt; .01, *** p &lt; .001.</formula><p>When, for the sake of robustness, gender was added as an explanatory variable in specification (iii), female participants were found to contribute slightly more than males (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table E1</ref>). When predicted response times were added to the specification to check whether these influenced PGG contributions within each time condition, participants taking longer to respond were shown to contribute less to the PGG (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table E1</ref> and the related discussion in the Extended Data section).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Coincidence of Cooperative Behaviour and Expected Reciprocity</head><p>Reciprocity provides a powerful mechanism for promoting and sustaining cooperation, even when expectations might prove to be overly optimistic <ref type="bibr">22, 23, 24, 25.</ref> Further, the manipulation of participants' beliefs about the partner's intention to cooperate has been shown to directly modulate participants' behaviour. For instance, beliefs about partners' intention to cooperate were shown to speed up cooperation and slow down defection <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . To explore the role of reciprocity across the lifespan, we began by eliciting beliefs about the contributions of others by asking participants to estimate the contribution of their two partners in the PGG after playing the PGG. These two estimates</p><p>were then averaged to construct a variable, called expected cooperation, aimed at capturing the participant's expectations about the cooperativeness of others.  Findings reported in column (iv) of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> establish that in such a specification, expected cooperation remained the only significant variable in explaining PGG contributions. In essence, age and time were shown to co-determine expectations about the cooperation of others as well as PGG contributions. One may speculate that time and age first determine beliefs about PGG contributions of partners which in turn determine participants' PGG contributions. To further highlight the fact that age and time jointly determine PGG contributions as well as expected cooperation, in specification (v) of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>, we ran the same regression as in specification (iii), but with expected cooperation as a dependent variable instead of PGG contributions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">= + * + * + * * (v)</formula><p>As evident from <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>, coefficients in specification (v) were minimally affected relative to those reported specification (iii) of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimism as a Determinant of Cooperative Behaviour and Beliefs about Cooperation</head><p>A measure of optimism was then elicited from participants to test whether general optimism increases expected cooperation and in turn PGG contributions. Participants were asked to estimate the likelihood that certain negative events might happen to them in the future (knowing the proportion of the general population experiencing such negative outcomes). It is well documented that individuals tend to underestimate the subjective likelihood of such negative events, even when the actual probabilities are low, a phenomenon known as optimism bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</p><p>An index of optimism was constructed by averaging participants' estimates of their subjective probability of experiencing negative events in the future (ranging in the data from 0 to 60 with lower values for the index revealing a more optimistic outlook). Two simple OLS regression established that optimism was associated with expected cooperation and PGG contributions, with more optimistic individuals expecting others to contribute more (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table E2</ref>). Further analyses revealed age being a positive determinant of optimism (see <ref type="table">Table E3</ref>), and optimism being a positive determinant of PGG contributions even holding fixed age and time, see column (vi) of <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref> where the following Probit specification was estimated:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= + * + * + * * + * (vi)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional Cooperation as an Intuitive Process</head><p>To verify the extent to which individuals explicitly reciprocate in the PPG, participants were asked to play the same PGG but this time aware of how much their two other partners would usually contribute (and therefore, will likely have contributed). Contrary to the manipulation conducted when eliciting cooperative expectations about partners, these tasks were designed to explicitly assess the intention to cooperate given prior information about other partners' actual behaviour.</p><p>Participants were presented with five informational settings, ranging from low contributions from both partners to high contributions from both partners, and including unequal contributions from the two partners. We analysed the effects of such informational manipulations on PGG contributions to understand to which extent conditional cooperation is an intuitive rather than deliberative process and how it is impacted by aging. OLS regressions were run to estimate the following three models for conditional cooperation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">_ = * (vii) _ = * + * (viii) _ = + * + * (ix)</formula><p>where _ denotes the PGG contribution of a participant who knows that their two partners likely contributed respectively and tickets, and denotes the contribution when the participant does not know the contribution of their partners.  <ref type="table">Table E4</ref> for further details). These results</p><p>showcase both reciprocity as a key determinant of contributions and the intrinsic optimism of participants about the behaviour of their partners in the original uninformed PGG.</p><p>When time was added as an explanatory variable in specification (viii), time-pressure was found</p><p>to have a positive effect on cooperation. Irrespective of the contributions given by partners, intuition favoured cooperation. Specifically, participants in the time-delay condition contributed less in the informed settings than in the uniformed one, even when faced with the most generous partners who were contributing 3.5 tickets on average (see <ref type="table">Table E5</ref>). Instead, relative to the original uniformed PGG, those in the time-pressure condition contributed more when faced with the most generous partners (who contributed on average 3.5 tickets), less when faced with the most selfish partners (who were contributing on average 0.5) and comparably when faced with partners donating on average 2 tickets.</p><p>By further adding a constant and age as explanatory variables in specification (ix), the key insights remained largely unaffected. However, age was found to be positively associated with the contributions across the five informed settings (and significantly so in two of them) even accounting for the fact that contributions in the original PGG were already increasing with age (see <ref type="table">Table E6</ref>).</p><p>Adding constants had a profound effect on the estimation by differentiating the three settings in which the average partners' contributions amounted to 2. More equitable contributions by partners (2-2 and 3-1) were found to have a higher constant and a less pronounced dependence on the original PGG contribution than the setting in which contributions were most inequitable (0-4), revealing that inequality in partners' contributions led to more sensitive responses by participants (see <ref type="table">Tables E6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Rise of Altruism from Adulthood to Old Age</head><p>To test whether pure generosity, or altruism, contributes to intuitive cooperative behaviour, participants were then asked to play a dictator game in which they chose how much to donate to others, knowing that they would not receive anything in return (under the same time conditions used in the PGG). Dictator games have been used traditionally to measure pure altruism rather than cooperative behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Eckel &amp; Grossman, 1996)</ref>. Behaviourally stark differences appear across these two settings despite incentives coinciding and selfish behaviour being strategically optimal in both tasks.</p><p>As in PGG, the main empirical model specifications consisted of ordered Probit regressions in which the likelihood of donating any number ∈ {0,1, … ,4} of lottery tickets was explained by age, time condition, and the interaction between the two. The following ordered Probit regressions were run (as in the original PGG):</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">= + * + * + * * (x) = + * + * * (xi) = + * + * + * * (xii)</formula><p>where denotes the donation of the participant in the dictator game.</p><p>As in the PGG, age had a positive and significant effect on donations. In the baseline specification (x), individuals were shown to donate more as they grew older with donations increasing over the lifespan by as much as 60% (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2a</ref>). Probit specifications (xi) and (xii) by age group further revealed that altruism first declines from adolescence until adult age, and then increases rapidly and consistently across adulthood and old age, as can be seen in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2b</ref> and 2c (for details see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table E10</ref>). The pattern is notably different from behaviour in the PGG in that PGG contributions increased till adulthood only to decline in old age, whereas DG donations declined till adulthood only to increase thereafter. Further, time-pressure had a positive impact on DG donations across age groups (except for adults), whereas PGG contribution where diminished by time-pressure in adolescence.</p><p>This suggests altruism as an intuitive behavioural response present from adolescence. A caveat to this observation is the behaviour of adults where the time condition had a very limited impact on DG donations. This was also the case in PGG, where contributions of adults were only marginally affected by the time condition. One may conjecture that in both games, adults followed well-established norms of behaviour irrespective of the time given for a decision, entailing high levels of cooperation in public goods setting, and low levels of altruism in dictator setting. Finally, we ran a simple OLS regression with DG donations as a dependent variable and PGG contributions as the only explanatory variable (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2d)</ref>. Participants in the DG donated on</p><p>average 51% of what they were contributing in the PGG with an R 2 = 0.59. Such a stark difference in behaviour across the two tasks suggests that participants clearly understood the difference between the two tasks (the potential benefits of cooperating in the PGG vs the act of donating without receiving anything in return in the DG).</p><p>Two additional specifications then established that DG donations significantly increased PGG contributions above and beyond the effects of age, time, and their interaction (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table E11</ref> for details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk Aversion and Desire for Social Acceptance as Determinants of Cooperation</head><p>Measures of risk aversion and of desire for social acceptance (i.e., need to belong) were added to the main specification (iii). Adding elicited certainty equivalents (a measure of risk aversion that we elicited using a standard task <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> ) and need-to-belong responses (a measure of desire for acceptance that we elicited using a standard survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> ) as regressors to our baseline established that more risk averse individuals (i.e. those with a lower certainty equivalent) contributed less to the public good than individuals with lower risk aversion (both conditioning on DG donations and not) suggesting that participants perceived contributing as a risky option (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table E1</ref> and E11). As expected, participants caring more about social acceptance contributed more to the public good (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table E1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>According to recent dual-process accounts of cooperative decision making, deliberative selfcontrol sustains selfish impulses to maximise an individual's payoff, whereas cooperative and altruistic behaviour is favoured by intuition and social heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . The current results support the view of intuitive processes underpinning cooperative behaviour. However, they also reveal important changes in cooperative behaviour throughout the lifespan, overall suggesting that an intuition for cooperation may not be the default in all stages of life. We found that the intuition to cooperate increases with age but outperforms self-reflected behaviour only with adulthood <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1b)</ref>. Indeed, adolescents contribute more in the PGG when asked to reason about their choice than when they were forced to respond quickly, a result that is in stark contrast with the hypothesis that intuition supports cooperation in this age group. Adolescents seem to be intuitively selfish.</p><p>Intriguingly, inspection of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1c</ref> reveals that intuitive and deliberative processes underlying cooperation do not change linearly across the lifespan. It appears in fact that from youth until adulthood the intuitive processes lead to norms that are ever more cooperative as individuals most likely learn about the benefits of cooperative behaviour. Instead, deliberative processes appear to follow a quite distinct developmental patternwith reflection favouring cooperation in adolescence relative to the instinctive norm and hindering cooperation in early adulthood and old age. Adults instead appear so ingrained in their cooperative and altruistic norms of behaviour that decision time simply does not affect their choices, with such norms being most cooperative and least altruistic among all age groups (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1a and 2b)</ref>. These patterns suggest that it is through experience and exposure to cooperative environments over the lifespan that individuals learn about the benefits of cooperating and instinctively contribute more than through deliberation.</p><p>Our second main result establishes that the cooperative behaviour of individuals is largely driven by the expectations or beliefs about cooperative behaviour of partners. This does not change throughout the lifespan: adolescents, adults and older people consistently contribute 6% more than what they expect others to contribute, irrespective of time constraints. In essence, age and decisiontime appear to co-determine both the level of cooperation expected from partners and contributions in the PGG. One could speculate that in the construction of a hierarchy of processes, age and intuition might first modulate the beliefs about other people's cooperative behaviour, eventually determining an individual's cooperative choices (a proposal that would be consistent with prior work, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> ).</p><p>The fact that all participants contributed essentially what they believed others would contribute suggests two aspects characterising cooperation: first, that throughout the lifespan, humans expect to be reciprocated, which is in line with developmental studies revealing that the norm of reciprocity is acquired already during the preschool years <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> ; second, that throughout the lifespan, beliefs about other people's decisions are modulated by intuition and deliberation in the same way that their own decisions are.</p><p>We also found that optimism shapes expectations about partners' contributions, so that more optimistic individuals acted more cooperatively in the PGG themselves and also expected their partners to be more cooperative <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> . Importantly, our data show that optimism grows with age, which can partly account for the reflective approach to cooperation in adolescence. A possibility here is that younger individuals are less optimistic about their future and about the behaviour of others, which in turn pushes them to be instinctively more cautious about the potential consequences of their cooperative behaviour.</p><p>The fact that older participants were more optimistic than younger ones also aligns with previous findings and with the socioemotional selectivity theory. The latter posits that aging is associated with increasing motivation to derive emotional meaning from life, leading to a general positivity bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . The fact that older people were found to be more optimistic, promoting their contributions in the PGG as well as their expectation about others' positive intentions, appears to support the claim that motivations and investments change during aging (with optimism being a mechanism driving such changes).</p><p>When analysing the role of conditional cooperation through different informational settings by varying the expected contributions of partners, we found reciprocity and intuition to be the key drivers of cooperative behaviour. More specifically, individuals responded to the information received by contributing more when faced with generous partners, and less when faced with stingy ones. Further, participants in the time-pressure condition contributed more than those in the time-delay condition.</p><p>Results on conditional cooperation also established that younger individuals were more inclined to "punish" partners who made more heterogeneous contributions (e.g., 4 and 0 lottery tickets), while older individuals focused more on the fact that one partner was cooperating and less on the fact that the other one was defecting. Again, this is in line with a general optimism bias displayed by the older but not by the younger participants.</p><p>DG results revealed that altruistic behaviour also appears to be supported by a dual-process cognitive architecture which however influences the development of altruism differently than the development of cooperation. Altruism was found to increase non-linearly with age: first declining from adolescence until adult age, and then increasing rapidly across adulthood and old age. As expected, older people were more generous than younger people, a pattern that has been confirmed across different economic games (for a meta-analysis, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> ; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42 )</ref>. As was the case with cooperation, working-age adults were the group least affected by the time condition and seemed ingrained in their norm of behaviour irrespective of the time constraints.</p><p>Lastly, we found that both risk aversion and need to belong partly explain cooperative behaviour. Irrespective of time constraints, more risk-averse individuals cooperated less, and individuals with higher scores in the need to belong scale (measuring the relative desire to be socially accepted) cooperated more, establishing that key behavioural traits shape our cooperative behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . The fact that differences between intuitive and deliberate processes diminished when introducing these factors revealed that both risk aversion and the desire for social inclusion also shape the social heuristics in cooperative settings.</p><p>This study has shown how intuitive processes shape both cooperative and altruistic behaviours differently across the lifespan. Intuition played a limited role in working-age adults in both games (with adults relying on well-established heuristics irrespective of the time condition), but affected all other age groups significantly. Cooperation was shown to grow over the lifespan and was found to be intuitive in young adults and older adults, but to be a deliberative process in adolescence. On the contrary, altruism was shown to decline until adulthood only to increase towards old age and to be intuitive in all age groups except for working-age adults. Expectations about others' prosocial behaviour, but also personal predispositions or personality traits, all appear to contribute to the shaping of the cooperative humans that we become.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited by word of mouth across *** (blinded for reviewing purposes) and through online fliers and advertisements posted on Facebook and on a few online journals for *** (blinded for reviewing purposes) readers such as *** (blinded for reviewing purposes) (for the groups of younger and older adults only). A total number of 390 individuals took part in the study, but the final analyses included 370 participants since some participants did not complete key elements of the study (for instance, reporting their age) and were consequently excluded from the analysis (for details about the sample see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table E12</ref>).</p><p>Participants were invited to take part in an online survey and received a link to the study, which was run on Pavlovia (https://pavlovia.org/). Participants were not paid and completed the survey on a voluntary basis. However, they were told that by participating, they had the chance to win one of two 50-euro prizes, which would be assigned at the end of the study. They were also told that the odds of winning 50 euros were calculated on the basis of the number of lottery tickets earned while playing the economic games in the survey (the more tickets earned during the game, the higher the chance of winning the prize). The study was approved by the Ethical committee of the *** (blinded for reviewing purposes), following the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki for human research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Description of Tasks and Procedure</head><p>The survey took 25-30 minutes to complete and comprised two main games: the public goods game (PGG, presented in several versions, with or without prior information about the other players' contributions) and the dictator game (DG). We also elicited risk aversion (RA), optimism bias (OB) and administered at the end the need to belong scale (NB).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Public Goods Game (PGG)</head><p>To understand cooperative behaviour, we first ran a one-shot version of the public goods game in which each participant was matched with two other (fictitious) participants. In the game, participants were instructed that both themselves and the other two players would receive four lottery tickets and that they had to decide how many tickets to contribute to a common fund (by entering a number between 0 and 4; for the explanation of the game and the instructions given to participants, see Movie S1). The total amount of tickets placed in the common fund would then be doubled and divided evenly among the three players. The maximal number of tickets (namely, 8) would be obtained when the three partners contributed all their tickets to the common fund. The selfishly optimal strategy was not to contribute any tickets irrespective of the decisions taken by the partners.</p><p>About half of the participants were randomly assigned to the time-pressure condition, whereas the other half was assigned to the time-delay condition. In the time-pressure condition, participants had only 10 seconds to make their decisions and select their answers, whereas in the time delay condition, they were told that they had to wait at least 10 seconds before providing their answers, and then had 20 seconds to respond (see in the Extended Data: Basic Data Checks). Thus, whereas in the time-delay condition participants were instructed to take their time (at least 10 seconds) for reasoning before making their decision, in the time-pressure condition they were instructed to respond quickly by relying on intuition. Instructions given to participants were specifically tailored to either the timepressure or the time-delay condition (see Movie S2 and S3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Expected and Conditional Reciprocity</head><p>To investigate the expectations of participants about the cooperative behaviour of their fictitious partners, we asked them to estimate how many tickets the other two players contributed, by inserting a number between 0 and 4 for each of their partners. Then, we investigated the tendency of individuals to engage in conditional cooperation by having them play the PGG again under the same time condition, but while presenting them first with the typical contributions for the two anonymous partners (see Supplementary Material and Movie S4 and S5 for details). In particular, the following five informational settings were considered:</p><p>- After completing the PGG, participants played a one-shot Dictator game (see Supplementary</p><p>Material and Movies S6 and S7 for details). As in the PGG, participants played under two timeconditions (time-pressure and time-delay) and had to decide how many of their four lottery tickets to donate to the other partners, explicitly being informed that they would not have received anything in exchange of their donation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk Aversion Task</head><p>Once completed the DG, participants completed a classical risk aversion task 29 measuring aversion to risk (i.e., the preference for certainty over risky outcomes even when the expected returns are identical, for instance when one prefers earning 50 euros with certainty than gambling to win 100 euros or nothing with a 50% probability). Participants were presented with pairs of boxes and were told that they had to choose one of them. Each box contained a probability distribution over lottery tickets. For instance, participants were asked to choose between Box 1 containing 10 tickets with 50% probability and none otherwise, and Box 2 containing 5 lottery tickets with certainty. The following seven choices were presented to subjects:</p><p>-10 tickets with probability 50% and none otherwise vs 5 tickets for sure -7 tickets for sure vs 10 tickets with probability 50% and none otherwise -3 tickets for sure vs 10 tickets with probability 50% and none otherwise -10 tickets with probability 50% and none otherwise vs 8 tickets for sure -6 tickets for sure vs 10 tickets with probability 50% and none otherwise -10 tickets with probability 50% and none otherwise vs 4 tickets for sure -2 tickets for sure vs 10 tickets with probability 50% and none otherwise</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Optimism Bias</head><p>In the Optimism Bias task, participants were presented with 10 statements depicting the probability of negative events (e.g., "50% of Italian couples divorce at least once in their lifetime") occurring in the national or worldwide population and were asked to report the likelihood that that same event could happen to them in the future (see Supplementary Material for the list of items).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Need to Belong</head><p>Lastly, participants answered a 10-item questionnaire, known as the Need to Belong Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Leary et al., 2013)</ref> aimed at assessing their desire and need for social contact and inclusion (see Supplementary Material for the complete list of items).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 Participants'</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Choices in the Public Goods Game Note.

Finally, when partners' contributions were high (i.e., contributions of 3 and 4), participants contributed as in the original PGG. These associations were estimated by running OLS regressions without constants, having the original contribution (standard PGG) as the only independent variable and the new contribution (conditional) as the dependent one (see</figDesc></figure>
