			<abstract>
				<p>Value-based decisions are biased by Pavlovian cues present in the environment. However, it remains unclear whether Pavlovian bias can disrupt optimal decision-making, leading to maladaptive choices in humans. To test this hypothesis, a Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) paradigm was used. Participants first learned an optimal decision-making strategy, which involved preferring the rich option (70% reward probability) over the poor option (30% reward probability) to maximize rewards. Subsequently, Pavlovian cues predicting one or the other option were introduced during decision-making. Results confirmed our hypothesis: maladaptive Pavlovian bias persisted with both unobservable and observable rewards, reducing reward income. Notably, this result was replicated with an independent sample. In a third experiment we reduced the cue-outcome association strength during Pavlovian learning, obtaining a decrease of the Pavlovian bias with observable rewards. These findings establish a link between Pavlovian biases and maladaptive behaviors, with implications for understanding and potentially mitigating pathologies as addiction and impulsivity.</p>

It is well-established <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dickinson &amp; Balleine, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dolan &amp; Dayan, 2013)</ref> that the influence of environmental cues on decision-making is mediated by Pavlovian learning, a process in which an initially neutral stimulus acquires motivational and predictive significance through repeated associations with a specific reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Berridge, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Robinson &amp; Flagel, 2009)</ref>. As a result of this process, the environmental cue acquires the ability to bias choice towards actions that lead to predicted reward, as opposed to alternative instrumental actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bray et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Garofalo et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Garofalo et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Garofalo et al., , 2021</ref>. Such Pavlovian bias can be adaptive, promoting efficient decision-making (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Badioli et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cartoni et al., 2016 for reviews)</ref>. However, it can also become maladaptive <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Everitt &amp; Robbins, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Marzuki et al., 2024)</ref>. In fact, there are circumstances in which Pavlovian learning may conflict with instrumental goals, leading to poor control of actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Le Pelley et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Watson et al., 2014)</ref>. For example, it has been demonstrated that rats approach a light predictive of food even when this behaviour thwarts food obtainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dayan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Holland, 1979)</ref>. More generally, many behavioural idiosyncrasies are mediated by or involve Pavlovian biases, such as addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hogarth &amp; Chase, 2011)</ref>, impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Sommer et al., 2017)</ref>, or framing effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(De Martino et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>In general, Pavlovian and instrumental systems operate in parallel, summing up information to determine the final decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Dickinson et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hogarth &amp; Chase, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Huys et al., 2011)</ref>. Despite the increasing literature on these topics, it is not yet clear if Pavlovian bias can interfere with previously learned optimal decision-making strategies. We hypothesize that Pavlovian cues can have a maladaptive influence on humans, biasing choice towards the predicted outcome even when it represents a suboptimal choice, because it alters the maximization of the overall reward income.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we adopted a modified version of the Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) paradigm designed to assess optimal decision-making strategies. Participants had to choose between two options (i.e., R1 and R2) associated with two different, but equally desirable outcomes (i.e., O1 and O2). Crucially, while R1 was associated with a 70% probability of obtaining a reward (i.e. the rich option), R2 was associated with a 30% probability of obtaining a different, but equally desirable, reward (i.e. the poor option). In this scenario, healthy humans tend to exhibit reward matching behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Rutledge et al., 2009)</ref>, i.e., the tendency to distribute their choices across available alternatives in the same proportion as the rewards obtained from those alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baum, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Herrnstein, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Iigaya et al., 2019)</ref>. In our task, reward matching, by favoring R1 (rich option) over R2 (poor option), was the optimal decision-making strategy, because it allowed maximizing the overall reward income. Consequently, a significant deviation from reward matching (e.g., equally distributing the responses between the two options, or preferring the poor option) could be considered suboptimal, as it would cause the loss of a certain amount of reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cunningham &amp; Shahan, 2018)</ref>. In a subsequent phase, two Pavlovian cues were introduced, either predicting O1 or O2, to assess their ability to bias the optimal decision-making strategy in favour of the predicted, but lesser, outcome.</p><p>Classically, Pavlovian bias is tested under extinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bray et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Huys et al., 2011)</ref>, where participants cannot see if they are obtaining rewards (i.e., transfer with unobservable reward). This approach isolates the effect of Pavlovian cues without the confounding influence of outcomes. Additionally, it highlights Pavlovian bias, as the repeated performance of actions without rewards weakens the strength of instrumental actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Todd et al., 2014)</ref>. Conversely, testing Pavlovian bias with observable rewards (i.e., transfer with observable reward) explicitly demonstrates maladaptive behavior induced by the cue <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cartoni et al., 2016)</ref>. This scenario closely mirrors real-life situations, where we typically observe the outcomes of our choices and adjust our behavior based on feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dickinson &amp; Balleine, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we conducted three experiments to examine the influence of Pavlovian bias on decisionmaking with unobservable and observable rewards. In Experiment 1 and 2, we hypothesized that highly predictive Pavlovian cues would significantly disrupt optimal decision-making in both conditions. In Experiment 3, we reduced the cue-outcome association strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Trick et al., 2011)</ref> to determine if a lower predictive value would weaken the Pavlovian bias, particularly in the observable reward condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1 METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Twenty-six healthy volunteers (13 females, mean age = 24.42; sd = 3.11 years; mean education = 16.92; sd = 1.29 years) were recruited for the experiment. All participants provided their written informed consent to participation. The number of participants was determined based on a power analysis conducted on G*Power software (version 3.1, Universit√§t Kiel, Germany) with the following parameters: 2 x 4 repeated measures (RM) design; effect size (Œ∑p 2 ) = 0.08; significance level (Alpha 2-sides) = 0.05; power = 0.95. The design was chosen based on the planned analysis. The effect size was estimated based on the minimum effect size obtained from all previous studies conducted by our group with a similar task <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Degni et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Garofalo et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Garofalo et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Garofalo et al., , 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Garofalo &amp; di Pellegrino, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Garofalo &amp; Robbins, 2017)</ref>. The study was conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines and the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the University of Bologna.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental task</head><p>The task consisted of a Pavlovian-to-Instrumental (PIT) paradigm divided into four consecutive phases: a Pavlovian learning phase, in which participants learned cue-outcome associations, an Instrumental learning phase, in which participants learned response-outcome associations, and two transfer phases, in which the suboptimal influence of Pavlovian cues on instrumental responses was tested in the absence or in the presence of the outcome, respectively. During all phases, an image of a slot-machine was presented on a white background. The slot-machine was composed of two displays, respectively on the top and bottom, and two levers, which appeared on the left and right of the slot-machine ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). The task was programmed on OpenSesame v3.2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Math√¥t et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pavlovian learning phase</head><p>In this phase, participants had to learn the association between three specific conditioned stimuli (CSs, i.e., fractal images balanced for luminance, complexity, and color saturation) and their corresponding outcomes. Two CSs served as CS+ (CS+1 and CS+2), so they were paired respectively with two different but equally desirable rewarding outcomes (O1 and O2, i.e., two food snacks previously tailored to each participant) in the 80% of trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Garofalo et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Garofalo &amp; di Pellegrino, 2015)</ref>. In the remaining trials (20%), they were paired with a non-rewarding outcome ("X"). The third CS served as CS-, so it was always paired with the non-rewarding outcome ("X"). The association between CSs and outcomes was counterbalanced across subjects.</p><p>Each trial ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1a</ref>) consisted of a variable intertrial interval (ITI, 0.5-1.5 s), in which the slot machine was "empty" (with no CSs or outcomes) and a fixation cross appeared in the center of the screen, followed by the appearance of one of the CSs (2 s) on the upper display of the slot-machine. After that, the image of the corresponding outcome appeared on the lower display (1 s), while the CS remained stable on the upper display. During this phase, no levers were represented and hence available.</p><p>The phase was structured in a series of blocks to be repeated until a learning criterion was reached. Each block consisted of 30 trials (10 for each CS). At the end of each block, for each CS the question "What food did you obtain with this stimulus?" appeared to test whether all stimulus-outcome associations were correctly established. These blocks were repeated from a minimum of two times to a maximum of eight times. The learning criterion consisted in correctly reporting the stimulusoutcome associations at least two times in a row. If the learning criterion was achieved, the task moved to the following phase. Otherwise, after four wrong answers, the task was aborted.</p><p>Before and after the phase, a liking 9-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 9 (very much), was presented for each of the three CSs, to ensure (a) comparable values between CSs at the beginning of the experiment, and (b) the acquisition of Pavlovian learning at the end of the phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instrumental learning phase</head><p>In this phase, participants had to learn the association between two responses (R1 and R2) and two rewarding outcomes (O1 and O2). The responses consisted of two computer keys (respectively "z" and "m") corresponding to the two levers on the left and right of the slot-machine. Each time a computer key was selected, the outcome appeared on the lower screen of the slot machine. Moreover, visual feedback was provided such that the corresponding lever appeared as pushed <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1b</ref>). Of note, the rewarding outcomes were the same as the ones used during Pavlovian learning. This phase differed from the instrumental learning phase typically used in PIT experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Degni et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Garofalo et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Garofalo et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Garofalo et al., , 2021</ref>, because we implemented an optimal decisionmaking strategy to perform the task. Specifically, in our task there was an imbalance in the probability to obtain the two outcomes: one response (R1, or "ritch option", counterbalanced between left and right between participants) was associated with a 70% chance of receiving the corresponding reward (O1), while the other response (R2, or "poor option") was associated with a 30% chance of receiving the corresponding reward (O2). For both responses, in the non-reinforced trials a no-reward ("X") was presented as outcome.</p><p>Importantly, a "baiting rule" was inserted <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bari &amp; Gershman, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Rudebeck et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Sugrue et al., 2004)</ref>, which stipulated that the longer an agent abstained from choosing a particular option, the greater the probability of receiving a reward for that option. In other words, if an unchosen option would have been rewarded, the reward was delivered the next time that option was selected. Under these circumstances, the probabilistic strategy (i.e., the optimal decision-making strategy) that allows to maximize the amount of rewards obtained (independently of the type of reward) would consist of pressing R1 in the 70% of trials and R2 in the 30% of trials. This tendency to distribute choices across available alternatives in the same proportion as the rewards obtained from those alternatives is called reward matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baum, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Herrnstein, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Iigaya et al., 2019)</ref>. Hence, in this experiment, the further away from reward matching the more suboptimal the behaviour.</p><p>Each trial consisted of variable ITI (0.5-1.5 s), in which the slot machine was "empty" and a fixation cross appeared in the center of the screen, followed by the appearance of the two levers respectively on the left and right of the slot-machine. The appearance of the levers served as a go-signal for the participants to make their choice and select one of the two levers. To avoid distraction and provide time pressure, participants were told that they had to make the choice quickly, or they would lose the chance to obtain a reward in that trial. If the choice was given within 2000 ms, the image of the corresponding outcome appeared on the lower display (1 s); otherwise, no outcome would appear and the trial was terminated.</p><p>This phase was structured in a series of blocks to be repeated until a learning criterion was reached. Each block terminated after a total of 50 trials, for an average duration of about 3 min. At the end of each block, the question "What food did you obtain by pressing this button?" appeared (one for each response) to test whether all response-outcome associations were correctly established. These blocks were repeated from a minimum of two times (100 trials) to a maximum of eight times (400 trials). The learning criterion consisted of correctly reporting the response-outcome associations at least two times in a row. If the learning criterion was achieved, the task moved to the following phase. Otherwise, after four repetitions, the task was aborted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer phase with unobservable reward</head><p>This phase tested the influence of conditioned stimuli (CSs) on decision-making. Each trial ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1c</ref>) consisted of a variable ITI (0.5-1.5 s), in which the slot machine was "empty" and a fixation cross appeared in the center of the screen, followed by the appearance of one of the CSs on the upper display and of the levers on the left and right of the slot-machine. As in the instrumental learning phase, the appearance of the levers served as a go-signal for the participants, and a time pressure of 2000 ms was included. Differently from the instrumental learning phase, this transfer phase was performed under nominal extinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cartoni et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Degni et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Huys et al., 2011)</ref>, i.e. participants were instructed that they were still earning food but, since the lower display of the slot machine was malfunctioning, they would not be able to see the outcomes.</p><p>The phase consisted of 90 trials in which the CSs appeared on the upper display (30 per condition) and 30 control trials ("No Cue condition") which were equal to the instrumental phase (no CSs appear simultaneously with levers), for a total of 120 trials.</p><p>This phase allowed us to study whether, in the presence of outcome-predictive CSs, participants followed the pre-learned optimal decision-making strategy (reward matching) or whether the presence of the CSs influenced the participants' choice favoring a congruent response (i.e., a response previously paired with the same outcome) over an incongruent response, thus pushing the participant's overall performance away from the ideal matching and determining a suboptimal behaviour. Critically, in this second scenario, the CS+1 should increase the number of R1 (ideally to be chosen 70% of the time) and the CS+2 should increase the number of R2 (ideally to be chosen 30% of the time).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer phase with observable reward</head><p>This phase was structured as the previous one, but it was not conducted under extinction ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure  1d</ref>), i.e., participants could see the outcome corresponding to their choice. The criterion for earning rewards was the same as the instrumental learning phase (i.e., reward matching). So, to optimize the probability to obtain reward, participants had to match the probabilities associated with R1 and R2 (i.e., 70% and 30%, respectively) regardless of the CS. This phase allowed us to investigate whether the CSs may induce a suboptimal behaviour (see previous paragraph) despite the overt presence of the outcome. Indeed, while in the transfer phase with unobservable reward the absence of a visual outcome could mask the suboptimal performance (i.e., lower number of rewards obtained), the overt presence of the outcome should here inform the participant about the amount of reward collected following each choice. In each trial, after an intertrial interval (ITI) of 500-1500 ms, one out of three conditioned stimuli (CSs) was presented, followed by the associated outcomes. Two CSs were paired with two different rewarding outcomes (O1 and O2), while the third control CS (CS-) was paired with a no-rewarding outcome. Participants had to learn the CS-outcome associations. (b) Instrumental learning phase. In each trial, after an intertrial interval (ITI) of 500-1500 ms, two levers appeared on the left and right side of the slot machine. By pressing the levers (R1 and R2), participants could obtain two outcomes (O1 and O2). The optimal decision-making strategy was given by an imbalance in the probability of earning rewards between the two responses: R1 led to O1 with a 70% chance, while R2 led to O2 with a 30% chance. (c) Transfer phase with unobservable reward. In each trial, after an intertrial interval (ITI) of 500-1500 ms, one of three conditioned stimuli (CSs) was presented together with two levers that appeared on the left and right side of the slot-machine. Participants were asked to press the two levers (R1 and R2) to obtain the same outcomes (O1 and O2) obtained in the previous phase, but they were informed that no outcomes would appear during this phase (i.e., nominal extinction). (d) Transfer phase with observable reward. In each trial, after an intertrial interval (ITI) of 500-1500 ms, one of three conditioned stimuli (CSs) was presented together with two levers that appeared on the left and right side of the slot machine. By pressing the levers (R1 and R2), participants could obtain two outcomes (O1 and O2). The outcome appeared for 1000 ms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The two rewarding outcomes were tailored to each participant. Upon recruitment, participants rated the subjective liking of a set of 9 different food items (4 savoury foods and 5 sweet foods). For each participant, the experimenter selected two highly and equally valued foods on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 5 (Very much). These foods were then used as rewards for the experiment by using the corresponding visual images. Participants were asked to refrain from eating for 3 hours prior to the experiment. Before starting the experimental session, new liking and wanting 9-point Likert scales, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 9 (very much), were presented for the two foods previously detected, to ensure comparable values between the rewards. Specifically, we showed the picture of each food and asked to participants the following questions: "How much do you usually like to eat it?" and "How much would you like to eat it now?", respectively for investigating general liking and current wanting of the rewards. Participants were also asked to rate their current level of hunger, to ensure high hunger in all participants. After providing informed consent, participants were comfortably seated in a silent room and their position was centred relative to the computer screen at about 60-cm viewing distance. The experimenter placed on the table the food rewards previously chosen by the participant, to ensure a high level of motivation throughout the task. Participants were informed that, at the end of the experiment, they would receive an amount of food proportional to the number of food pictures visualized during all task phases. In each phase, participants were required to pay attention to the screen and follow the instructions reported at the beginning. The entire experimental session lasted about 40 minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>Data processing was performed offline using custom-made MATLAB scripts (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). For the analysis of the percentage of responses during both instrumental learning phase and transfer phases, reaction times means and standard deviations were calculated for each participant, and outliers beyond three standard deviations from the mean were excluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Berger &amp; Kiefer, 2021)</ref>. For the analysis of transfer phases, the percentage of responses was calculated separately for each CS. Normality and sphericity assumption of the data were visually inspected and verified assessing values of skewness and kurtosis &lt; 2 for all variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hopkins &amp; Weeks, 1990</ref>).</p><p>The statistical analyses were conducted providing converging evidence from two statistical approaches, namely null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) and bayesian inference. NHST was used to establish the presence of statistically significant (p &lt; .05) differences between conditions. Effect sizes were estimated with Cohen's d for all t-tests and partial eta squared for all ANOVAs. Bayes Factors were used to quantify the probability of the data under the alternative hypothesis versus the null hypothesis (BF10) and test absence of difference, where appropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Kruschke, 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Liking and wanting</head><p>Participants reported comparable liking (t25 = 0.46; p = 0.65; dcohen = 0.09; BF10 = 0.23) and wanting values (t25 = -0.25; p = 0.8; dcohen = -0.05; BF10 = 0.21) for the two rewarding outcomes at the beginning of the task, validating the methodological accuracy in food selection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acquisition of Pavlovian learning</head><p>A 3 (CS: CS+1, CS+2, CS-) x 2 (time: before, after Pavlovian learning) repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted using as dependent variable the liking of CSs. The CS by time interaction resulted statistically significant (F2,50 = 16.42; p &lt; 0.001; Œ∑p 2 = 0.4; BF10 = 56.7). No statistically significant main effects were found (all F &lt; 2.3; all p &gt; 0.14; all Œ∑p 2 &lt; 0.09; all BF10 &lt; 0.45). Specifically, a visual inspection of the results shows no differences between CSs before Pavlovian learning, whereas after Pavlovian learning CSs+ are equally more liked than CS-. In addition, while liking similarly increases from before to after Pavlovian learning for CSs+, it decreases for CS- <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2a</ref>). Descriptive statistics are reported in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acquisition of instrumental learning</head><p>The acquisition of instrumental learning consisted of learning the appropriate strategy to maximize the chance of obtaining rewards, by increasing the percentage of R1 as compared to R2 in order to reach the reward matching. The perfect matching behaviour would correspond to 70% of R1 responses and 30% of R2 responses. Trial-by-trial plot ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref>) highlights how participants learn the optimal strategy throughout the task, increasing the percentage of R1 and reducing R2 around the 30th trial. We performed a paired-samples t-test (Response: R1 and R2) on the dependent variable percentage of responses. Results showed a statistically significant increase (t25 = 5.39; p &lt; 0.001; dcohen = 1.06; BF10 = 1626) of the percentage of R1 (M = 0.6; SD = 0.09), as compared to R2 (M = 0.4; SD = 0.09). These results confirm that participants have differentiated between R1 and R2, even if they never reach the perfect matching (70% of R1/30% of R2).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Transfer phase with unobservable reward</head><p>A repeated-measures 4 (CS: CS+1, CS+2, CS-, No Cue) x 2 (Response: R1 and R2) ANOVA was conducted using the percentage of responses as dependent variable <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3a)</ref>. Results showed a statistically significant CS by Response interaction (F3,75 = 12.2; p &lt; 0.001; Œ∑p 2 = 0.33; BF10 = 2.12x10 12 ), while no other statistically significant results emerged (all F &lt; 1.16; all p &gt; 0.29; all BF10 &lt; 0.23). Specifically, in the No Cue condition, a reward matching behaviour similar to the instrumental learning phase (increased R1 compared to R2) was observed. In the outcome-predictive CSs conditions, i.e., CS+1 and CS+2 (respectively predictive of R1 and R2), a deviation from the reward matching behaviour was observed towards R1 and R2, respectively. In the CS+1 condition, the increase in R1 lead the performance closer to the perfect matching (70/30). In the CS+2 condition, the ratio of responses was reversed, such that an increase in the percentage of R2 compared to R1 was observed. Crucially, this result indicates that, in light of its indirect association with R2, the CS+2 was able to exert a strong influence on behaviour, to the extent that it did not simply cause a deviation from but a complete reverse of the reward matching behaviour. Finally, no differences in the percentage of R1 and R2 were observed in the CS-condition. Summarizing, while the CS+1 condition cannot be considered as suboptimal, because it brings participants towards the perfect matching, considering the undermatching observed during the instrumental learning phase, the performance in the CS+2 condition can be considered suboptimal. However, being this phase under extinction, we can only speculate that this behaviour is suboptimal for participants, but we cannot exclude that participants altered their strategy because they thought that even the probability to obtain the outcomes would be changed in the presence of outcome-predictive cues (they did not have the feedback given by the presence of the outcome to disentangle this possibility).</p></div>

Results showed statistically significant CS by Response interaction (F3,75 = 6.84; p &lt; 0.001; Œ∑p 2 = 0.22; BF10 = 5.98x10 8 ) and main effect of Response (F1,25 = 27.74; p &lt; 0.001; Œ∑p 2 = 0.53; BF10 = 4.04x10 3 ), while the main effect of CS did not result statistically significant (F3,75 &lt; 0.001; p = 1.00; Œ∑p 2 &lt; 0.001; BF10 = 0.02). More specifically, in the CS-and No Cue conditions, a reward matching behaviour similar to the instrumental learning phase (increased R1 compared to R2) was observed. In the outcome-predictive CSs conditions, the results of the transfer phase with unobservable reward were replicated. Specifically, in the CS+1 condition, an increase in the difference between R1 and R2 was observed, which can be attributed to the indirect association between CS+1 and R1 (the rich option). This increase in R1 lead the performance closer to a perfect reward matching (70/30), or, in other terms, a reduction of the undermatching behaviour observed during the instrumental learning. Finally, in the CS+2 condition, the ratio of responses was reversed (increase in the percentage of R2 compared to R1). This phase was performed with the presence of the outcome after each choice, so it allows to conclude that the CS+2 generates suboptimality in participants. Thereby, the alteration of the optimal decisionmaking strategy shall result in a reduction of the overall reward income, or, in other terms, in a suboptimal performance (see next analysis). During transfer with unobservable reward (a), the reward matching strategy is confirmed in the CS+1 and No cue condition, while in the CS-condition participants show similar percentage of R1 and R2. In the CS+1 condition the difference between R1 and R2 is increased, while in the presence of CS+2 the strategy is inverted, with increased R2 compared to R1. During transfer with observable reward (b), data show the maintenance of the matching strategy (increased R1 compared to R2) in the CS-and No Cue conditions, an increase of the difference between R1 and R2 in the CS+1 condition, and an inversion of the strategy in the presence of the CS+2 (increased R2 compared to R1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall reward income</head><p>To confirm that the deviation from reward matching in the presence of the CS+2 lead to a suboptimal performance (i.e., lower gains) during the transfer phase with observable reward, a one-way Anova (CS: CS+1, CS+2, CS-, No Cue) was conducted using as dependent variable the overall reward income. This analysis aimed to compare the general amount of reward won in each condition (i.e., type of CS) independently of the type of response chosen and the type of outcome obtained. The Anova revealed a statistically significant (F3,75 = 5.63; p = 0.002; Œ∑p 2 = 0.18; BF10 = 76.35) difference between the four conditions, showing a reduction of the overall reward income in the presence of CS+2 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure  4</ref>) as compared to all the other conditions, thus confirming a suboptimal performance. Moreover, results showed a slight increase of reward in the presence of CS+1, compared to the control conditions <ref type="bibr">(CS-and No cue)</ref>. This last result is in line with the reduction of undermatching in that condition (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3b</ref>). Overall, results show a reduced amount of reward obtained in the presence of CS+2, i.e. the stimulus that was able to reverse the matching strategy. Moreover, a slight increase in the amount of reward in the CS+1 condition, compared to the control conditions was observed.</p></div>

In addition, we demonstrated that Pavlovian cues can alter such acquired strategy, biasing choice towards the actions paired with the same outcome. Importantly, this deviation is not modulated by the strength of instrumental actions, since it occurred with unobservable and observable reward. Specifically, the crucial result concerns the CS+2, i.e., the conditioned stimulus that predicted the poor option, which is demonstrated to make humans suboptimal, as corroborated by the selective reduced reward income in such condition (during the transfer phase with observable reward). Notably, we replicated this pattern of results across two independent experiments, with a preregistered direct replication of Experiment 1, thereby demonstrating the robustness of our findings.</p><p>We hypothesize that the Pavlovian bias observed in Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 depended on the predictivity acquired by Pavlovian cues, which interfere-with and overcome the optimal decisionmaking strategy, thus driving people towards a suboptimal alternative.</p><p>Therefore, to test this hypothesis, we performed a third experiment in which we altered the Pavlovian predictivity by reducing the strength of the CS-outcome association (from 80% to 20%) in the Pavlovian learning phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Trick et al., 2011)</ref>, expecting to find a subsequent reduction of the Pavlovian bias. More specifically, while during the transfer phase with unobservable reward we expect to confirm a deviation from the optimal decision-making strategy, during the transfer phase with observable reward we anticipate that the reduced predictivity of the outcome -combined with the possibility to keep track of the rewards collected -would not be sufficient to induce a suboptimal behaviour.</p></div>

Specifically, we hypothesized that (a) Pavlovian cues can instigate suboptimal choices and that (b) this Pavlovian bias can be modulated by altering the strength of instrumental actions (transfer with unobservable reward vs observable reward, both Experiment 1, 2, and 3), and/or the Pavlovian predictivity (Experiment 1 and 2 vs. Experiment 3).</p><p>Initially, participants were guided to follow an optimal decision-making strategy through instrumental learning, which consisted of allocating more choices to a rich option (R1 -70%) as compared to a poor option (R2 -30%). We found that participants adaptively adjusted their choices based on reward probability when presented with equally desirable outcomes, a behaviour known as reward matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Herrnstein, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr">see also Houston et al., 2021)</ref>. This confirmed that, without any environmental cue, the distribution of instrumental actions is determined by the actionoutcome contingencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dickinson &amp; Balleine, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Next, two Pavlovian cues were introduced during decision-making, each predicting a distinct yet equally desirable reward. Results obtained from Experiment 1 and its preregistered direct replication (Experiment 2) demonstrated that these Pavlovian cues could influence decision-making strategies, directing choices toward the anticipated outcomes. Particularly noteworthy was the CS+2 condition, where the cue predicted the outcome associated with the less favorable option. This condition revealed that Pavlovian biases could override established optimal decision-making strategies, leading to increased preference for the less favorable option. While there was also an increase in choices towards the anticipated outcome (the more favorable option) in the presence of CS+1, the extent of this deviation was inconclusive, potentially due to a ceiling effect (where the more favorable option was already heavily favored even without a matching CS+). Notably, in control conditions participants consistently adhered to the optimal decision-making strategy, indicating that the observed effects were not simply due to forgetting the previously learned strategy.</p><p>Consistently, Pavlovian bias manifested in both conditions of the transfer phase -where participants were either unable to observe the rewards of their choices or could observe them. Particularly in the latter phase, this bias led participants to make suboptimal choices, resulting in reduced overall rewards. Despite being aware of their lower earnings compared to other conditions, participants continued to favor the less rewarding option. In Experiment 3, we mitigated Pavlovian predictivity by reducing cue-outcome contingencies from 80% to 20% <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Trick et al., 2011)</ref>. This adjustment eliminated Pavlovian bias in the transfer phase where rewards were observable, indicating that participants adhered to an optimal decision-making strategy in the presence of (weak) Pavlovian cues. Conversely, in the phase with unobservable rewards, we replicated the findings of Experiment 1: participants exhibited maladaptive choices in the presence of Pavlovian cues but maintained optimal decision-making in control conditions.</p><p>Taken together, these results prompt important considerations. In Experiment 1 and 2, where the predictability of Pavlovian cues was high, the Pavlovian system appeared to override the instrumental one, resulting in instances of clearly suboptimal choices. Conversely, in Experiment 3, where the predictability of Pavlovian cues was reduced, their interference diminished. In this case, the Pavlovian bias could be mitigated, especially when participants had explicit evidence of their current outcomes.</p><p>A plausible explanation for the consistent findings in both experiments' transfer phases with unobservable rewards is that, in the absence of outcomes, participants relied solely on the Pavlovian cue as their primary source of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dorfman &amp; Gershman, 2019)</ref>. This interpretation is supported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cartoni et al. (2013)</ref>, who suggested that Pavlovian bias during extinction reflects the principle of efficacy: participants believed following the cue would increase their chances of obtaining the associated reward, motivating them to choose that option consistently regardless of optimal decision-making strategies.</p><p>Pavlovian cues guiding ongoing decisions align with evolutionary explanations, as Pavlovian bias typically ensures correct choices in environments that are poorly controllable <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Algermissen &amp; den Ouden, 2023)</ref>. However, once an environment becomes controllable, this bias should diminish. In the transfer phase with observable rewards, where participants can track their accumulated rewards, they are expected to swiftly adapt and revert to an optimal decision-making strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(De Martino et al., 2006)</ref>. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, highly predictive Pavlovian cues may exert such strong interference that individuals struggle to adjust their choices based on instrumental action preferences.</p><p>This result is consistent with several previous findings from animal <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bouton, 2011)</ref> and human <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Hogarth &amp; Chase, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Le Pelley et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Seabrooke et al., 2017)</ref> studies emphasizing that Pavlovian bias is extremely persistent, even over time. In fact, it is known that Pavlovian bias allows fast, albeit inflexible responding <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Boureau et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dayan et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Huys et al., 2012)</ref>. The ability to downregulate Pavlovian bias (or upregulate, when such bias is adaptive) could be relevant to prevent diseases characterized by aberrant biases, such as addiction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Garbusow et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Sommer et al., 2017)</ref>, eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Watson et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Watson et al., , 2016</ref>, or gambling <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(da Costa et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Genauck et al., 2021)</ref>. The result that reducing the predictivity of Pavlovian cues can reduce the Pavlovian bias raises the possibility that our procedure, as well as a future broader comprehension of the neural mechanisms involved in such Pavlovian bias, might be useful to help in prevention and possibly in therapeutic interventions to suppress maladaptive effects of environmental cues in pathological populations.</p><p>The mechanisms underlying how Pavlovian cues interfere with instrumental system remain unclear. In Pavlovian learning, environmental cues acquire both a predictive and an incentive value <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Berridge, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Robinson &amp; Flagel, 2009)</ref> through repeated associations with rewards. It has been hypothesized that both predictive <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Mahlberg et al., 2021)</ref> and incentive (Hinojosa-Aguayo &amp; Gonz√°lez, 2020) values of cues might contribute to Pavlovian biases over decision-making. Unfortunately, our current task does not allow to disentangle between these aspects. Future studies should address this issue more directly, perhaps recording psychophysiological measures of incentive value <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Pietrock et al., 2019)</ref>, or studying differences in the Pavlovian bias in populations that acquire -or not -such incentive value <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Degni et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Garofalo &amp; di Pellegrino, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Schad et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>In conclusion, this study illuminates how Pavlovian cues can maladaptively bias decision-making, leading to suboptimal choices. Manipulating Pavlovian cue predictivity through cue-outcome contingency adjustments effectively mitigates this bias, underscoring its significant impact on decision-making. Future research should continue to explore Pavlovian bias to enhance our understanding and potentially develop strategies to mitigate its effects, promoting more adaptive decision-making. Understanding the mechanisms behind Pavlovian bias advances our comprehension of decision-making modulators and offers promise for interventions in disorders characterized by distorted biases.  </p></div>
