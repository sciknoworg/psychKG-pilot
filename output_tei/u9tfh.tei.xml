			<abstract>
				<p>People tend to explain wrongdoing as the result of a bad actor or bad system. In five studies (four U.S. online convenience, one U.S. representative sample), we tested whether the way people understand unfairness affects how they sanction it. In Pilot 1A (N = 40), people interpreted unfair offers in an economic game as the result of a bad actor (vs. unfair rules), unless incentivized (Pilot 1B, N = 40), which, in Study 1 (N = 370), predicted costly punishment of individuals (vs. changing unfair rules). In Studies 2 (N = 500) and 3, (N = 470, representative of age, gender, and ethnicity in the U.S), we found that people paid to change the rules for the final round of the game (vs. punished individuals), when they were randomly assigned a bad system (vs. bad actor) explanation for prior identical unfair offers. Explanations for unfairness affect how people sanction it.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Seeing and sanctioning structural unfairness</head><p>In 2015, it was revealed that Larry Nassar, team doctor to U.S. women's national gymnastics team, had been abusing gymnasts for decades. In her testimony in 2021, Olympian Simone Biles said, "To be clear, I blame Larry Nassarand I also blame an entire system that perpetrated his abuse" (as quoted in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Williams, 2021)</ref>. Similarly, in the aftermath of a fraudulent account scheme at Wells Fargo (for which only top executives were convicted), the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau blamed "unchecked incentives" for the harm that occurred <ref type="bibr">(Corkery, 2016)</ref>. In both cases, there were individuals who were able to perpetrate tremendous harm within a system that permitted or even facilitated this behavior. Blame fell not only to the individuals who committed these acts of wrongdoing, but to the system that made it possible. In each of these examples, there are two narratives: (1) A "bad actor" who is responsible for the bad outcome and (2) a "bad system" or structural factors that are ultimately responsible for the outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amemiya et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gantman &amp; Paluck, 2022</ref>).</p><p>These two narratives have different implications for both seeing and sanctioning unfairness. Both the legal system and moral psychology (which are often related, Dunlea &amp; Heiphetz, 2021) have a straightforward path for punishing individuals who commit acts of wrongdoing. Harms perpetuated by an intentional, capable agent tend to garner the most blame and punishment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alicke, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ames &amp; Fiske, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cushman, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gray et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Malle et al., 2014)</ref>. Larry Nassar was sentenced to life in prison and the CEO of Wells Fargo was banned from working at a bank again. What happens to the systems that allowed these men (and unknown others) to perpetuate their harms?</p><p>Understanding systems SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS To understand this question, we turn to how people understand structural inequality (i.e., stable, interconnected institutional practices and cultural beliefs that consistently advantage some groups over others; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amemiya et al., 2023)</ref>. Structural inequality is distinct from other extrinsic inequality (e.g., random adverse events) because it makes social categories salient <ref type="bibr">(e.g., gender)</ref> and makes observers believe inequality will persist over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amemiya et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vasilyeva et al., 2021)</ref>. Moreover, people recognize structural factors for inequality when they are aware that structural constraints exist and can reason counterfactually that, if the societal structure were different, the levels of inequality would change <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amemiya et al., 2023)</ref>. Often, this counterfactual reasoning is difficult because some people are motivated to see the current system, and its hierarchies, as fair and just <ref type="bibr">(Lerner &amp; Miller, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jost et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Pratto et al., 1994)</ref>. People also vary in how much they make structural (vs. individual) level attributions for poverty <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Piff et al., 2020)</ref>. In short, there is variation in how people see, and want to see, the larger systems that they are part of.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Blame for multiple agents</head><p>Yet, people, especially in Western societies, tend to ascribe blame to individuals rather than systems; individuals are more salient <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cimpian &amp; Salomon, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rhodes &amp; Mandalaywala, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vasilyeva &amp; Lombrozo, 2020)</ref>-and so people tend to blame them. Even when groups are involved, people tend to parse responsibility in terms of the individuals within that group. For example, people assign more blame and punishment to individual members of groups whose actions are pivotal to the outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Zultan et al., 2012)</ref> and who make (vs. carry out) decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gantman et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Paharia et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Phillips &amp; Shaw, 2015)</ref>. People are also more likely to see societal structures (e.g., patriarchal societies) as being due to inherent characteristics of the people who make up those structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cimpian &amp; Salomon, 2014)</ref>. Even</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS</head><p>when people are blaming multi-agent groups or systems, they search for individuals within those organizations to blame. This leaves a puzzle for understanding how people think about responsibility at the systemic level, where loci of wrongdoing may not rest in any one individual's mind-but rather in rules that permit abuse of power <ref type="bibr">(Vredenburgh &amp; Bender, 1998)</ref>, perverse incentives <ref type="bibr">(Kerr, 1995)</ref>, and social norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Paluck et al., 2016)</ref> and so, there is no individual agent to assign blame and punishment to.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Present Research</head><p>In the current research, we examined how different explanations of unfairness (bad actor vs. bad system) affect punishment and judgments of blame. We used an economic game, which allowed us to separate people's thinking about structural unfairness (here, rules that permit abuse of power) from their pre-existing ideas about society-and to measure punishment behavior.</p><p>First, we found that people are more likely to describe unfair outcomes as the result of a bad individual over a bad system (Pilot 1A) unless incentivized (Pilot 1B). Then, we modified the game to enhance the salience of the rules. We found that when people spontaneously understand (Study 1) or are explicitly told (Study 2) that unfairness is due to bad systems (vs. bad actors) people prefer to pay slightly more to change the rules of the game (than punish individuals). We replicated these results in a U.S. sample representative of age, gender, and ethnicity (Study 3).</p><p>Studies 1-3 were pre-registered; data, materials, and code for analyses for individual experiments, are available on the Open Science Framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pilots 1A and 1B</head><p>Pilots 1A and 1B examined how often people recognized unfairness as a result of a bad actor or a bad climate in a modified Ultimatum Game.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of the modified Ultimatum Game</head><p>We designed a three-player version of the Ultimatum Game <ref type="bibr">(Camerer &amp; Thaler, 1995)</ref> to measure actual punishment behavior in a more generalizable context. We called our modified game the Fairness Game, with an "Allocator" who decided how much of the money ($0.10 total) to offer the "Receiver", who always accepted the offer (adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wylie &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gantman, 2023 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Yudkin et al., 2016)</ref>. Both the Allocator and the Receiver were pre-programmed into the game set-up, making the Observer the only real participant in the game. All incentives were real.</p><p>After an explanation of the game and an example round (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 1A -1C</ref>), participants were assigned to the role of the Observer. As the Observer, the participant facilitated the game by clicking to start each round.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref> is an overview of the game. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref> describes the role of the Observer after each round. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1C</ref> is an example round shown to each participant. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref> describes the final decision the Observer made SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS After the game began, the Observer saw multiple rounds of offers by different Allocators; they either saw one Allocator give a very unfair offer, and two fair Allocators (six rounds with two extremely unfair offers: 5, 9, 5, 5, 8, 5) or multiple Allocators each making a slightly unfair offer <ref type="bibr">(6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">6,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">7,</ref><ref type="bibr">6)</ref>. The average dollar amount of the offers was matched across conditions.</p><p>When each round ended, the Observer had a choice; they could spend their own money ($0.02) to take money ($0.02) away from the Allocator after each round, or they could keep their money and proceed with the game (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B)</ref>. At the end of the last round, the Observer made one final decision: they could spend an additional amount of money ($0.04) to change the rules of the game for future participants (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1D</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We collected data from 40 consenting participants on Prolific (Mage = 33.78, SDage = 12.32, 48% Female, 50% Male, 65% White). All respondents were paid $2.12 for their participation and were debriefed at the end of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and procedure</head><p>After playing multiple rounds of the game, participants were asked comprehension questions about the game, such as whether the game was fair or unfair and whose role it was to give money in the game. Next, we included a manipulation check (i.e., "If you had to choose, which would you pick to describe any unfairness you saw in the game?") to confirm whether participants saw evidence of a bad actor or bad system. Participants then answered questions about blame across the players and the game itself (e.g., "To what extent is/are [Allocator/Receiver/the rules of the game] to blame for the unfair distribution of money in the game?"). Finally, we measured individual differences, including Belief in a Just World (e.g., "I think basically the world is a just place"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dalbert, 1999)</ref>, and political ideology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We describe our results here and for Pilot 1B with only descriptive statistics because our sample is small and inferential statistics are not informative. Of our 40 participants, we found that most participants incorrectly answered our manipulation checkespecially in the bad climate condition (16 out of 20 incorrect in bad climate condition, 8 out of 20 incorrect in bad apples condition). Most people were unable to recognize a climate of unfairness, even when they witnessed it themselves. Participants also blamed the Receiver (i.e., the victim) for the unfair distribution of money in the game more often in the bad apples condition (M = 1.57, SD = 0.81) compared to the bad climate condition (M = 1.22, SD = 0.47), and were less likely to change the rules of the unfair game when they thought the Receiver was to blame (r = -.14). For our second pilot study, we investigated whether participants were able to identify a "bad climate" with an accuracy incentive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pilot 1B: Adding incentives</head><p>We investigated whether participants did not, or could not, see unfairness as the result of systemic factors in the game. We addressed this by adding a financial incentive for accurately identifying unfairness in the game.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We collected data from 40 consenting participants on Prolific (Mage = 35.68, SDage = 11.93, 43% Female, 48% Male, 68% White). All respondents were paid $2.12 for their participation and were debriefed at the end of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS</head><p>Our measures were similar to Pilot 1A with minor changes. We changed the punishment decision to a forced-choice: at the end of the game, participants decided between punishing the Allocator of their choosing (as many as they wanted) or changing the rules of the unfair game for future participants. In addition, participants were observing the results from a different game that had been completed in the last 24 hours rather than experiencing the game in real time.</p><p>We had a manipulation check to confirm whether participants saw evidence of a bad actor or bad system, but with an added incentive ("What kind of unfairness did you see?</p><p>Remember, if your answer matches ours, you'll get a 3 cent bonus"). We measured whether participants changed the rules of the game and increased the cost to participants (i.e., "What would you like to do? Spend 6 cents to change the rules of the game, Spend 5 cents to punish some or all of the Allocators, or Do nothing/keep all my money"). Additionally, if participants chose to punish the Allocators, we allowed them to select which ones they wanted to punish. We again measured blame for the individual players and system, Belief in a Just World, and political ideology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Descriptive analyses showed that nearly every participant now identified unfairness in the game as we did (only 3 participants incorrectly identified whether the unfairness was the result of a bad apple or bad climate). Although preliminary analyses found no difference in willingness to blame the system by condition, participants who saw evidence of a bad climate were more willing to pay to change the rules of the game (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>). We again found that blame for the Receiver (i.e., victim blame) was negatively associated with willingness to change the rules in the bad apples condition (r = -.28). As a result, in Study 1, we switched to a Dictator Game to enhance the salience of the rules and reduce victim blame. Study 1 used a correlational design; we hypothesized that participants would be more willing to punish individuals when they understood unfairness in the game as the result of a bad actor and would be more willing to change the rules of the game when they understood unfairness as the result of the structure of the game itself.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of the modified Dictator Game</head><p>The procedure and materials were similar to those in our pilots, except for a few key changes: we now used a modified Dictator Game <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Guala &amp; Mittone, 2010)</ref> with the same Allocator making multiple offers, such that the avenues for punishment involved taking money SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS from an individual, selfish "dictators" (i.e., punishing a bad actor) or changing the rules of the game (i.e., changing unfair rules) for the final round of the current game. We made the option to change the rules slightly more costly than punishing the individual to partly capture that changing systems is more difficult than individual punishment. We also added a question to measure how people understood the source of unfairness in the game, included additional exploratory measures of system-level blame, and included structural attributions for poverty as another potential moderator. The changes are described in further detail below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>An a priori power analysis using GPower 3.1 <ref type="bibr">(Faul et al., 2009)</ref> indicated that a sample of 372 participants afforded us 80% power to detect a small effect (Odds ratio = 1.3) with a null hypothesis probability of 50%. We collected data from 370 consenting participants on Prolific and distributed the survey via Qualtrics. Participants ranged in age from 18-85 (Mage = 39.60, SDage = 12.86, 49% Female, 49% Male, 71% White). All respondents were paid $2.12 for their participation and were debriefed at the end of the study. As pre-registered, we conducted our analyses with and without those who failed our attention checks. Given that there were no differences in the analyses with the inclusion and exclusion of those who failed our attention checks, we retain all participants in the following analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unfairness explanations</head><p>To examine how people understood unfairness, we asked: "What kind of unfairness did you see?" Participants chose either "Allocator was a bad apple" or that the "game created a bad climate."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sanctioning decision SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS</head><p>Our primary dependent variable was a dichotomous decision to punish the bad actor (i.e., punish the individual Allocator) or change the rules of the game for the final round (i.e., punish the system; see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3. Instructions for dichotomous decision to change the rules</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System-level blame</head><p>Participants then answered questions about blame across the players and the game itself (as in Pilots 1A and 1B; e.g., "To what extent is/are [Allocator/Receiver/the rules of the game] to blame for the unfair distribution of money in the game?"). We also added an exploratory measure to help us understand blame for different structural factors. We group our items by face validity and recommendations from an Exploratory Factor Analysis (see Supplemental Materials 13 SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS for EFA output and an additional measure of system blame with low reliability). Blame for individual-level factors can be found in the Supplement. Blame for the system. As in our pilot studies, we used five items to measure systemlevel blame. A representative item is, "To what extent do you think the nature of the game is to blame for the unfair distribution of money in the game?" (1 = Not at all, 7 = Extremely; ⍺ = .65).</p><p>Structural attributions for unfairness in the game. We created three items to assess structural attributions for unfairness in the game (adapted from the structural attributions for poverty scale; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bullock et al., 2003)</ref>. The items involved rating the importance of different factors in contributing to the unfairness in the game, including "The design of the game itself", "The rules of the game," and "The incentives in the game" (1 = Not at all important to 7 = Very important; ⍺ = .71).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-existing worldviews</head><p>We included three pre-existing worldviews as potential moderators: beliefs in a just world, political ideology, and structural attributions for poverty.</p><p>Beliefs in a Just World. Six items measured a belief in a just world <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dalbert, 1999)</ref>. A representative item is "I think basically the world is a just place" (1 = Strongly disagree to 7 = Strongly agree; ⍺ = .88).</p><p>Political ideology. Three items measured political ideology: "Where on the following scale of political orientation would you place yourself?", "In terms of social and cultural issues, how liberal or conservative are you?" and "In terms of economic issues, how liberal or conservative are you?" (1 = Extremely liberal to 7 = Extremely conservative; ⍺ = .95).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Structural explanations for poverty. Six items from the Attributions of Poverty</head><p>Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bullock et al., 2003)</ref> measured structural attributions of poverty. The items SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS involved rating the importance of different factors in contributing to poverty (1 = Not at all important to 7 = Very important; ⍺ = .81). A representative item is "A capitalist society in which the wealth of some is contingent on the poverty of others."</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Following informed consent, participants were given an overview of the Fairness Game and went through an example of how a round could go. Next, the participants were assigned their role as the Observer. The Observer was told that they were in a unique position to see if the game was fair or unfair and were provided with a definition of a "bad apple" (i.e., a bad actor) and a "bad climate" (i.e., a bad system). All participants saw the same offers from the Allocator to the Receiver. After the third round, the game was stopped because unfairness was detected.</p><p>Participants read "We have detected unfair offers! We have paused the game" (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>). SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS The Observer then decided how to proceed; they could either pay to punish the Allocator and proceed with the current version of the game or pay to change the rules of the game for the final round. Participants were asked to explain the unfairness they witnessed and answered comprehension questions about the game, allocated blame across the players and the game itself, and answered individual difference measures. All participants were debriefed, compensated for their time, and received an additional payout after completion of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>First, we examined how people explained unfairness in the game. There was a significant difference in the number of people who understood unfairness as the result of a bad apple (69%) versus a bad climate (31%), z = -7.28, p &lt; .001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sanctioning decision</head><p>Next, we used a logistic regression to investigate whether understanding unfairness as the result of a bad apple or bad climate increased willingness to change the rules of the game. We use percentages for ease of interpretation.</p><p>We found a main effect of unfairness explanations on willingness to change the rules of the game, OR = 1.6, z = -2.05, p = .041. Participants were more willing to change the rules of the game when they understood unfairness as the result of a bad climate (73%) versus a bad apple (61%; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System blame</head><p>Across the two measures of system-level blame, we found that participants who understood unfairness as the result of a bad climate made stronger endorsements of system-level blame. Specifically, there was a positive correlation between understanding unfairness as the result of a bad climate and structural attributions for unfairness in the game, r = .13, p = .02, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.02, .22]</ref> and blame for the game itself, r = .40, p &lt; .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.30, .48]</ref>. We also examined the relationship between unfairness explanations and blame for the Allocator. We found that understanding unfairness as a bad climate was negatively associated with blame for the Allocator, r = -.33, p &lt; .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.42, -.24]</ref>. The results are summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Correlations between individual items are provided in the Supplement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-existing worldviews</head><p>Also in line with our pre-registration, we examined whether one's pre-existing worldviews moderated the relationship between spontaneous explanations for unfairness and the SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS decision to change the rules of the game (they did not; pbjw = .722, pstruct = .492, ppolID = .055), nor did they moderate system-level blame (all p's &gt; .05, see Supplement for full results).</p><p>When looking at pre-existing worldviews as individual predictors, only structural attributions for poverty predicted willingness to change the rules, OR = 1.20, z = 2.02, p = .043.</p><p>However, all three worldviews predicted system-level blame. For simplicity, we highlight blame for the game itself and provide our full summary of results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Across our different measures, we found that greater belief in a just world, r = -.19, p &lt; .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.29, -.10]</ref>, and increased conservatism were associated with lower blame for the game itself, r = -.16, p = .002, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.25, -.06]</ref>, while greater structural attributions for poverty were associated with higher blame for the game itself, r = .18, p &lt; .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[.07, .27]</ref>.

There was a negative correlation between the two, such that greater blame for the Allocator was associated with lower endorsement of blame for the game itself, r = -.24, p &lt; .001, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-.33, -.14]</ref>. Despite the possibility that unfairness results from a combination of bad actors in unjust systems, endorsing blame for individuals and the game itself were negatively correlated. Note. *p &lt;.05; ***p &lt; .001. We coded unfairness explanations as 0 = bad apples, 1 = bad climate. We coded willingness to change the rules as 0 = take money from Allocator, 1 = change rules of the game. Higher numbers mean more conservative ideology. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Inferred explanations for unfair offers in the Fairness Game were related to the kind of punishment preferred by participants. Understanding unfairness as the result of a bad system (vs. a bad actor) was associated with greater willingness to pay to change the rules of an unfair game, even when it was slightly more costly. Overall, more people attributed unfairness in the game to the Allocator than they did to the game itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 2-3</head><p>In Study 2, we explicitly told participants that the unfairness they witnessed in the game was the result of a "bad apple" or a "bad climate." We hypothesized that seeing a bad climate would be associated with a greater willingness to change the rules of the game and a greater endorsement of system-level blame. Study 3 was a direct replication of Study 2 with a U.S. sample representative of age, gender, and ethnicity. Because our methods and results were the same across the two studies, we report them together below.</p><p>Methods SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and design</head><p>Studies 2 and 3 used a between-subjects design to examine whether the type of unfairness explanation given to participants influenced system-level blame and punishment. We collected data from participants on Prolific and distributed the surveys via Qualtrics. Male, 73% White). All respondents were paid $2.12 for their participation and were debriefed at the end of the study. Given that there were no differences in the analyses with the inclusion and exclusion of those who failed our attention checks (see SM), we retain all participants in the following analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>Our materials were similar to those in Study 1, except that rather than asking participants to infer the type of unfairness they witnessed, we randomly assigned participants to learn that they had witnessed a "bad apple" or a "bad climate" to explain the very same distribution of unfair offers. Participants were told either: "We have detected unfair offers! Specifically, we have detected a Bad Apple. The Allocator is repeatedly keeping an unfair amount of money" or "...There is a Bad Climate. The game itself is allowing the Allocator to repeatedly give unfair offers" (see <ref type="figure">Figures 6A and B)</ref>. We used the same dichotomous measure of punishment, measured judgements of structural unfairness in the game, blame for the game itself, and blame for the Allocator as dependent variables, and measured political ideology as a potential moderator. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Manipulation of unfairness explanations in the bad apples condition (left) and bad climate condition (right).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="20">SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>We followed the same procedure as in Study 1 with the addition of a between-subjects manipulation of unfairness explanations. After providing their informed consent, participants were given an overview of the Fairness Game and went through an example of how a round could go. Next, the participants were assigned their role as the Observer and were told that they were in a unique position to see if the game was fair or not. All participants saw identical offers from the Allocator to the Receiver for the entire game. After the third round, participants saw the graphic of the stop sign and read that the game was stopped because we, the experimenters, detected unfairness in the game. Participants were randomly assigned to be told that the unfairness was the result of a "bad apple" or "bad climate." The Observer then decided how to proceed; they were able to pay to punish the Allocator and proceed with the current version of the game or pay to change the rules of the game for the final round. Participants then answered comprehension questions about the game, allocated blame across the players and the game itself, SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS and answered individual difference measures. All participants were debriefed, compensated for their time, and received an additional payout after completion of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>First, we examined how often people changed the rules of the game. There was a significant difference in the number of people who opted to change the rules of the game (Study 2 = 70%; Study 3 = 67%) versus punish the Allocator (Study 2 = 30%; Study 3 = 33%), zStudy2 = 8.60, p &lt; .001; zStudy3 = 7.40, pStudy3 &lt; .001. This is a much higher rate than in Pilots 1A and 1B which used an Ultimatum Game.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Change rules decision</head><p>Next, we used a logistic regression to investigate whether seeing unfairness as the result of a "bad apple" or "bad climate" increased willingness to change the rules of the game. We use percentages for ease of interpretation.</p><p>We found a main effect of unfairness explanations on willingness to change the rules of the game, ORStudy2 = 1.9, zStudy2 = 1.92, pStudy2 = .05; ORStudy3 = 1.6, zStudy3 = 2.19, pStudy3 = .028.</p><p>Participants were more willing to change the rules of the game when they saw unfairness that was the result of a bad climate (Study 2 = 74%; Study 3 = 72%) versus a bad apple (Study 2 = 66%; Study 3 = 63%; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 7</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="22">SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System blame</head><p>We used two measures to help us understand system-level blame. There was no difference in structural attributions for unfairness in the game by condition, pStudy2 = .765; pStudy3 = .267. However, participants in the bad climate condition (MStudy2 = 4.49, SDStudy2 = 0.98; MStudy3 = 4.45, SDStudy3 = 1.13) made higher blame judgments for the game than participants in the bad apples condition (MStudy2 = 4.19, SDStudy2 = 1.05; MStudy3 = 4.25, SDStudy3 = 1.12), tStudy2 (498) = 3.33, pStudy2 &lt; .001; tStudy3 (468) = 1.92, pStudy3 = .056. There was no relationship between type of unfairness and blame for the Allocator, pStudy2 = .442; pStudy2 = .728, and neither of these relationships were moderated by political ideology, p's &gt; .05. Finally, in-line with our preregistration, we found that more participants failed our manipulation check in the bad climate condition (Study 2 = 31%; Study 3 = 22%) than in the bad apples condition (Study 2 = 16%; Study 3 = 8%). In other words, people default to seeing bad actors even when they are explicitly told that it is the rules of the game that perpetuate unfairness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS</head><p>When participants were told that unfair offers in the game were the result of a bad climate (vs. a bad apple), they were more willing to pay to change the rules of the game for the final round than to to punish the individual who gave the unfair offers. These results were not moderated by worldviews of political ideology. Participants in both conditions were willing to change the rules, which may reflect our switch to a Dictator Game and the very small difference in cost between the two options ($.01). Contrary to our hypotheses, we did not find that a "bad apple" explanation was associated with greater blame for the Allocator. Participants likely brought their own explanations to the game alongside our manipulations, and may have blended their spontaneously generated explanations with our given one. This in turn, could lead to blended explanations like systems that allow bad actors to act badly, and may explain a lack of difference in blame for the Allocator across conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>We examined how explanations for unfairness affect how people want to sanction it. In two pilots, we found that people spontaneously infer unfairness in the economic game as due to a bad actor, unless incentivized. In three studies, including with a U.S. representative sample, we found that spontaneously inferring and being explicitly told that unfairness is the result of a bad system (vs. a bad actor) increased participants' willingness to pay to change the rules of an unfair games. The amount of unfairness witnessed was always equal or equivalent, and changing the rules was slightly more costly than punishing the individual. Our work contributes to growing research on understanding inequality and its implications for policy support <ref type="bibr">(Dietze &amp; Craig, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Piff et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Amemiya et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and future directions SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS</head><p>To open, we quoted Simone Biles stating that both an individual and system were to blame for the harm that befell her and other gymnasts. We recognize that we forced these two explanations to be mutually exclusive in our studies, and that people may think of a bad climate as a place full of bad apples. One difficulty people may face as they think about systemic unfairness, is that system-level (vs. individual) explanations may not provide as clear a causal path of events, which are important for explanations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lombrozo, 2006)</ref> and counterfactual reasoning, which can scaffold our understanding of structural inequality <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Amemiya et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lombrozo, 2006)</ref>. Future research could test whether a more clearly articulated causal path from system-level causes to the individual event of unfairness increases decisions to change the game itself. Participants in both conditions were also more willing to change the rules in our Dictator Game than in our Ultimatum Game, which may reflect how victim blame influences whether people seek change following unfairness (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Heffner &amp; FeldmanHall, 2019)</ref>. Future research can explore whether reducing victim blame increases support for structural change. We opted to operationalize a bad climate with a Dictator Game whose rules entail an imbalance of power and incentives for unfair offers. Future research could opt for other operationalizations of a bad climate, including policies that privilege some over others or rules that are ambiguously enforced (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wylie &amp; Gantman, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we used a sample of U.S. residents, and effects may not generalize across populations. For example, people in more collectivistic cultures (e.g., Eastern countries) assign a greater weight to situational factors than dispositional factors when explaining social events <ref type="bibr">(Morris &amp; Peng, 1994)</ref>. These attributional preferences have implications for the way people allocate blame <ref type="bibr">(Weiner, 1993)</ref> and support policies meant to address social problems (e.g., <ref type="bibr">SANCTIONING UNFAIRNESS redistribution, Cozzarelli et al., 2001)</ref>. Future research should explore the role of culture in how people explain unfairness in economic games and society more broadly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We examined how explanations for unfairness relate to how people want to see it sanctioned. Unfairness understood as the result of a bad climate is associated with greater willingness to change the rules of the game; while unfairness understood as the result of a bad actor is associated with individual punishment. The way we frame social issues-that is, knowing whether an issue is framed as a problem of bad actors (e.g., Larry Nassar) or a culture permissive of unfairness (e.g., rape culture)-affect how people choose to sanction it.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
