				<p>The valence of an individual&apos;s emotional response to an event is often thought to depend on their prior expectations for the event: better-than-expected outcomes produce positive affect and worse-thanexpected outcomes produce negative affect. In recent years, this hypothesis has been instantiated within influential computational models of subjective affect that assume the valence of affect is driven by reward prediction errors. However, there remain a number of open questions regarding this association. In this project, we investigated the moderating effects of outcome valence and decision context (Experiment 1: free vs. forced choices; Experiment 2: trials with versus trials without counterfactual feedback) on the effects of reward prediction errors on subjective affect. We conducted two online experiments (N = 300 in total) of general-population samples recruited via Prolific to complete a risky decision-making task with embedded high-resolution sampling of subjective affect. Hierarchical Bayesian computational modelling revealed that both outcome amount and reward prediction errors influenced subjective affect, but that the effects of reward prediction errors were moderated by both outcome valence and decision context. Specifically, we found evidence that only negative reward prediction errors (worse-than-expected outcomes) influenced subjective affect, with no significant effect of positive reward prediction errors (better-thanexpected outcomes). Moreover, these effects were only apparent on trials in which participants made a choice freely (but not on forcedchoice trials) and when counterfactual feedback was absent (but not when counterfactual feedback was present). These results deepen our understanding of the effects of reward prediction errors on subjective affect.</p>

In spite of these advances, however, much remains unclear concerning the effects of RPEs on subjective affect. Below we review the current state of knowledge in this field, highlighting several important open questions that the present study aims to answer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Effects of RPEs on Subjective Affect</head><p>The RPE hypothesis of affect has its roots in animal learning research, where emotional states were linked to the phenomenon of incentive contrast <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Flaherty, 1996)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Crespi (1942)</ref> found that rats trained to perform a task for a large reward subsequently performed worse on the task when the reward amount was unexpectedly reduced; by contrast, rats initially trained with a small reward improved their task performance when the reward amount was unexpectedly increased. Crespi proposed that these effects were mediated by animals' emotions, such that smaller-than-expected rewards (i.e., negative RPEs) produced negative emotions that inhibited performance of the task, whereas larger-than-expected rewards (positive RPEs) produced positive emotions that facilitated increased task engagement.</p><p>Although Crespi's findings prompted greater consideration of emotional states in theories of motivated behaviour (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hull, 1952;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Spence, 1956)</ref>, the role of emo-tion in subsequent studies was more assumed than explicitly tested. Similarly, later work on disappointment theory in economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bell, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Loomes &amp; Sugden, 1986)</ref> followed Crespi in proposing that better-than-expected outcomes produce positive emotion ("elation") and that worse-than-expected outcomes produce negative emotion ("disappointment"). Once again, however, the object of study in disappointment theory was the effects of these emotions on behaviour, rather than the emotions themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Wälde &amp; Moors, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In psychology, work on decision affect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mellers, Schwartz, Ho, &amp; Ritov, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mellers, Schwartz, &amp; Ritov, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mellers, 2000)</ref> focused more directly on the subjective experience of emotions produced by violations of expectations. These studies used a paradigm in which participants reported their subjective emotional responses to the outcomes of risky economic gambles. In this paradigm, positive and negative expectation violations can be directly quantified as the actual reward received minus the expected value of the gamble (i.e., the RPE). Across several studies, participants' emotional responses to gamble outcomes were shown to be influenced by both the gain/loss outcome of the gamble and by the associated RPE. These effects of RPE amount on subjective affect have been replicated and extended in recent computational modelling studies of subjective affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rutledge et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Eldar &amp; Niv, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rutledge et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Vinckier et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Blain &amp; Rutledge, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Villano et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Neville et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Vanhasbroeck et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>More broadly, an open question concerning the role of RPEs in subjective affect relates to the putative neural substrates of RPEs. RPEs are thought to be signalled in the brain by midbrain dopaminergic neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schultz, Dayan, &amp; Montague, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Niv, 2009)</ref>. However, some theoretical perspectives draw a distinction between the hedonic and the motivational properties of reward <ref type="bibr">(i.e., between 'liking' and 'wanting';</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Berridge &amp; Kringelbach, 2013)</ref>. Within this framework, dopaminergic activity in the brain is thought to relate more to the motivational than to the hedonic properties of reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Nguyen, Naffziger, &amp; Berridge, 2021)</ref>: that is, to the effects of reward on behaviour rather than on the resulting subjective experience of positive and negative affect. Viewed from this perspective, the strong association between (dopaminergic) RPEs and subjective affect that has been documented in the literature is in fact somewhat surprising and worthy of further examination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Decision Context</head><p>An RPE of a given magnitude may occur in any number of different contexts. As such, an important open question is whether the same RPE has different effects on subjective affect depending on the decision context within which it occurs. Appraisal theories of emotion (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ellsworth, 2013</ref>) suggest many aspects of decision context that might moderate the strength of RPE effects, among which we focus on two here: first, outcome control (i.e., whether the outcome that elicits an RPE was determined by the decision-maker's own actions); second, whether or not the outcome information that elicits the RPE is accompanied by counterfactual information about the outcome of unchosen choice options.</p><p>Appraisal theories of emotion suggest that whether or not an individual is in control of an event is an important determinant of their emotional response to that event. Control can alter perceptions of personal responsibility and self-blame <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Weiner, 1982)</ref>, which may be key in the development of certain negative valence emotions such as regret (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Smith &amp; Ellsworth, 1985)</ref>. Therefore, the degree of control an individual has over an event might moderate the degree to which an RPE elicited by that event influences their subjective affect, such that RPE effects are stronger when individuals feel personally responsible for the outcome obtained. This question has not been previously studied in this context of computational models of subjective affect.</p><p>Separately, a large body of work has shown that subjective affect is influenced by counterfactual information about the outcomes of unchosen options, such that positive (/negative) affect occurs when the received outcome is better (/worse) that the counterfactual outcome (i.e., regret and relief; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Johnson, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Roese, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Mc-Mullen &amp; Markman, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Coricelli &amp; Rustichini, 2010)</ref>. However, it is an open question whether the mere presence of counterfactual information also influences the effects of feedback from one's own choices on subjective affect. A recent theory by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bennett et al. (2021)</ref> predicts that the effects of an RPE on subjective affect will be weaker when it is accompanied by counterfactual feedback than if it occurs in the absence of counterfactual feedback. Intuitively, this is because counterfactual feedback provides additional information about performance when it is present, meaning that in this situation participants can judge their performance using a combination of the information from the counterfactual feedback and the information from the RPE; consequently, RPEs will tend to be weighted less heavily when counterfactual feedback is present compared to when it is absent. This theory therefore predicts that the mere presence of counterfactual feedback will moderate the effect of RPEs on subjective affect, independent of the regret/relief effects described above. However, because recent modelling studies have measured subjective affect in decision settings where no counterfactual feedback was provided, this prediction has not been empirically tested to date.</p><p>More abstractly, a common theme that unites these two unanswered research questions is whether aspects of the decision-making context independent of the RPE itself nevertheless modulate the effects of RPEs on subjective affect. Mathematically, an RPE is defined as the difference between actual and expected reward, independent of the decision context within which it is elicited. This mathematical definition does not allow the RPE to differ as a function of either outcome control (i.e., whether or not the RPE was generated by the agent's own action or by some action outside their control) or of counterfactual information availability (i.e., whether or not the RPE is accompanied by separate information about what would have happened if the agent had taken a different action). Addressing these questions is therefore crucial to understanding whether decision context alters the effects of RPEs on affect, as would be predicted by appraisal theories of emotion, or whether RPEs have the same effect in all contexts, as would be predicted by recent computational models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rutledge et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Eldar &amp; Niv, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Symmetric or Asymmetric Effects of Positive and Negative RPEs?</head><p>Independent of decision context, one under-studied question in recent modelling studies is whether positive and negative RPEs have symmetric effects on subjective affect. Most recent computational models have implicitly assumed that a positive and negative RPE of the same absolute size will exert equal but opposite effects on the valence of subjective affect (i.e., symmetric effects; <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rutledge et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Eldar &amp; Niv, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Eldar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Blain &amp; Rutledge, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Keren et al., 2021)</ref>. However, an alternative possibility is that these effects might be asymmetric <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mellers et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bennett &amp; Niv, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bedder, 2021)</ref>. The latter hypothesis would be consistent with studies of affect induction in the laboratory, which have robustly found stronger effects of negative affect inductions than positive affect inductions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Joseph et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Although most models do not consider positive and negative RPEs separately, there is some support for the asymmetry hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(van Dijk &amp; van der Pligt, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mellers et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bedder, 2021)</ref>. Moreover, asymmetric effects of RPEs on affect would also be conceptually consistent with the body of literature on incentive contrast effects. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Crespi (1942)</ref> originally observed both negative contrast effects (worse task performance after unexpected reductions in reward) and positive contrast effects (better performance after unexpected increases in reward), subsequent studies found that negative contrast effects were markedly larger and more robust than positive contrast effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Flaherty, 1996)</ref>. If positive and negative contrast effects are respectively driven by positive and negative emotions, as Crespi first proposed, then these behavioural findings may also point towards an asymmetry in the psychological impact of negative versus positive RPEs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dissociating RPE Effects From Effects of Reward Amount</head><p>Because RPEs are defined as the difference between actual and expected reward amounts, an RPE can only occur alongisde a concurrent reward event. This creates a potential for confounding between the separate effects of reward amount and RPE on subjective affect. To illustrate this distinction, consider again the negative affect caused by a cold day in the middle of summer. Two dissociable components of this event might separately produce negative affect: first, negative affect might simply result from the fact that people experience generally experience cold weather as unpleasant (i.e., a negative reward amount for cold weather, under the assumption that our hypothetical observer prefers warm weather to cold). This is separate from the RPE effect, which is negative affect that is specifically due to violations of expectations (i.e. the unpleasant surprise of a cold day in summer produces a negative RPE).</p><p>Although these two effects are correlated, they are dissociable in principle: we could, for instance, appraise the reward-amount effect of cold weather by measuring average negative affect on cold-weather days across the whole year, whereas the RPE effect could be measured as the degree to which cold weather produces more negative affect when it occurs in summer rather than winter (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mellers et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>To avoid confounding of RPE effects by reward amount effects, we suggest that it is important for computational models of subjective affect to distinguish changes in subjective affect produced by reward amount alone from changes in affect produced by RPEs. Some models do indeed take this approach (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mellers et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mellers et al., , 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mellers, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Villano et al., 2020)</ref> by modelling the effects of both reward and RPE separately and isolating the unique variance explained by each appraisal. By contrast, models that do not separately account for RPE and reward amount may have difficulty distinguishing fluctuations in affect due to RPEs from fluctuations in affect merely due to reward amount.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Study</head><p>In this study, we sought to deepen our understanding of the effects of RPEs on subjective affect by asking two separate research questions across two behavioural experiments. First, we asked whether RPE effects on subjective affect were moderated by decision context. We conducted two separate behavioural experiments in which we systematically manipulated two aspects of decision context (Experiment 1: manipulations of choice control; Experiment 2: manipulations of whether or not counterfactual information was also displayed). Both experiments used variations on the same basic behavioural paradigm <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>), involving a risky choice task with embedded self-report probes of subjective affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Mellers et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rutledge et al., 2014)</ref>. In each trial, participants chose between two stimuli, each of which could lead to gains or losses of 'points' (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1A)</ref>. We then used computational modelling analyses to test how participants' subjective affect fluctuated in response to different events in the task -and, in particular, whether the effects of RPEs produced by decision feedback differed across the different decision contexts. The two experiments were therefore distinct but related investigations of the role of decision context. Of course, these experiments do not exhaust the possible aspects of decision context that we might have studied; nevertheless, by investigating two aspects of decision context in two separate experiments, we sought to assess whether there were any consistent patterns of contextual moderation of the effect of RPEs on subjective affect.</p><p>Second, we appraised the role of outcome valence in the effects of RPEs on subjective affect. Across both experiments, we used computational modelling to test whether positive and negative RPEs differed in the overall strength of their effects on subjective affect. In both experiments we also analysed subjective affect using models that simultaneously accounted for the effects of both reward amount (i.e., amount of points gained/lost in each trial of the task) and of RPEs. We thereby sought to isolate the effects on subjective affect of RPEs elicited by decision feedback, over and above the changes in affect produced by the concurrent gain/loss amounts. In this respect, another major aim of our study was to statistically disentangle the effects of gain/loss amount and RPE on subjective affect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B</head><p>Forced-choice trials  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Trial schematic for risky choice task. A) Basic structure of a trial in the risky choice task. Cards differed in terms of reward probability and magnitude (left card: 50% chance of winning 100 points and 50% chance of losing 100 points; right card: 25% chance of winning 100 points and 75% chance of winning 0 points). The participant's choice was displayed with a white indicator below the chosen card, and feedback was provided for the outcome of the chosen card only (here, a loss of 100 points). Every 3-5 trials (jittered), the participants reported their subjective affective state using an Affective Slider. This schematic corresponds to the free-choice condition of Experiment 1 and the no-counterfactual-feedback condition of Experiment 2. B) In forced-choice trials of Experiment 1, the participant was informed that a card would be randomly chosen for them by a 'dealer'. The dealer's choice was displayed above the selected card, and the participant observed the outcome of this card only (here, a win of 0 points). This condition was visually represented by a lock symbol between the two choice options. C) In counterfactual-feedback trials in Experiment 2, the participant received feedback on the outcome of both the chosen card (here, loss of 100 points) and the unchosen card (here, win of 0 points). This condition was visually represented to participants by at the choice phase by a paired-cards icon.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>In Experiment 1, we sought to determine whether the effects of RPEs on subjective affect differed between free-choice trials and forced-choice trials. This experiment was not preregistered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. 150 adult participants (83 men, 63 women, 4 who did not endorse a binary gender) were recruited to take part in Experiment 1 via the online recruitment website Prolific. This sample size was determined according to an a priori simulation-based power analysis to give in excess of 80% power to detect a small effect size of reward amount on subjective affect. The experiment was conducted entirely online within the participant's web browser, and took approximately 25 minutes per participant. Participants were eligible to take part in the study if they were aged between 18 and 65 (M age = 33.1, SD = 10.6, range 18-62), were fluent speakers of English, did not have any vision impairment, and resided in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom (see Supplementary Section S1 for further demographic details). This experiment received ethical approval from the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee (application #31012), and participants gave informed consent via their web browser prior to taking part in the experiment. All participants received a base payment of USD $5 upon completion of the experiment, followed by a bonus payment of up to $1 depending on their winnings in the risky choice task (M = $0.56, SD = 0.31). We did not collect data regarding participants' racial identity, ethnicity, immigration history, or clinical diagnosis.</p><p>Questionnaires. Prior to commencing the behavioural task, participants completed a demographic questionnaire, a measure of subjective socioeconomic status (the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Socioeconomic Status; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adler, Epel, Castellazzo, &amp; Ickovics, 2000)</ref>, and the Perth Emotion Regulation Competency Inventory (PERCI; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Preece, Becerra, Robinson, Dandy, &amp; Allan, 2018)</ref>. To ensure results were not unduly influenced by inattentive responding (cf. Zorowitz, Niv, &amp; Bennett, 2021), we embedded two instructed-response attention checks within the PERCI scale. Any participant who responded incorrectly to both attention checks was automatically 'rejected' on Prolific and prevented from advancing to the behavioural task.</p><p>Behavioural Task. The risky choice task was presented to participants within their web browsers, using the jsPsych JavaScript library (de Leeuw, 2015) and custom Python server code using the Flask micro web framework. Participants were informed that they would play a card game, each trial of which comprised a choice between two face-down cards, each drawn from a different 'deck' of cards ( <ref type="figure">Figure  1A)</ref>. In free-choice trials, participants selected a card using the left/right arrow keys, and the chosen card was then 'flipped over' to reveal the outcome of the participant's choice (either a gain or a loss of points). In forced-choice trials, a card was randomly chosen on the participant's behalf. The cover story presented to participants for forced-choice trials was that choices were being made by a fictitious computerized 'dealer' who randomly selected one of the two cards. To progress forced-choice trials after viewing the choice options, participants were instructed to press the space bar to view the dealer's choice ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B)</ref>.</p><p>Participants were informed that they would always win or lose the point value of the chosen card, regardless of whether the choice was freely made or forced. Points won by participants during the task were exchanged for a monetary bonus at the conclusion of the experiment. In Experiment 1, participants always received feedback on the outcome of the chosen card only, and did not receive feedback on the outcome of the unchosen card.</p><p>Before making a choice, participants viewed information regarding possible outcome amounts and probabilities for each of the two cards. Overall there were five outcome amounts (+200, +100, +0, -100, or -200 points), and each card was associated with two of these five possible outcomes. The possible probabilities with which each of a card's two outcomes could could occur were either 50%/50% (as in the left card in <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>) or 25%/75% (as in the right card in <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>). Potential gains and losses were depicted in different colours, with magnitudes differentiated by colour saturation (e.g., light/dark blue for gains of +100/+200 points; light/dark green for losses of -100/-200 points; gain/loss hues counterbalanced between participants). In total, we generated 101 unique and non-stochastically-dominated choice pairs, varying in the magnitudes and probabilities of their possible outcomes (see Supplementary Section S2 for further details). The left/right mapping of cards within each choice pair was randomised across participants. Each choice pair was presented twice within the experiment (once as a free choice, once as a forced choice; see below); consequently, there are no stable trial-by-trial features of the choice options, and therefore no trialby-trial learning about choice options could take place. Accordingly, we treated each trial as an independent reflection of participants' underlying risk preference, with no concurrent reward learning.</p><p>Prior to the first trial and every 3-5 trials throughout the task (randomly jittered; 56 times in total), participants were asked to rate the valence of their current subjective affect on an affective slider <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Betella &amp; Verschure, 2016)</ref> using their computer mouse. This allowed for a measure of baseline affect prior to the first trial, as well as in response to events in subsequent trials. The affective slider was a bipolar scale ranging from 'extremely unhappy' ('as unhappy as you can imagine being'; left anchor) through neutral ('neither unhappy nor happy'; centre of slider) to 'extremely happy' ('as happy as you can imagine being'; right anchor). Emoji symbols were placed at each anchor, and a visual guide below the slider was used to indicate the intensity of positive or negative affect (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>).</p><p>Participants completed a total of 212 trials (101 free-choice, 101 forced-choice, 10 attention-check) over 4 blocks of 53 trials each. Different trial types were randomly intermixed, and the order of trials was randomised across participants. The 10 attention-check trials were choices in which there was an unambiguous correct an-swer (the worst possible outcome of the correct card was better than the best possible outcome of the incorrect card). These attention-check cards were used to screen out inattentive participants. Prior to beginning the task participants received instructions, completed five practice trials, and responded to five comprehension check questions which had to be answered correctly before participants were permitted to begin the task (see Supplementary Section S3). Participants were instructed that their bonus payment would depend on their overall winnings (i.e., gains minus losses; point winnings were converted to USD at a rate of 10 cents per 500 points won, up to a maximum of USD $1). Consequently, the outcome of each individual trial in this task was of relatively low stakes in real terms.</p><p>Computational Modelling Analyses. Calculation of Appraisal Variables. In our computational modelling analyses, we sought to determine which appraisals of decision feedback drove trialby-trial fluctuations in participants' subjective affect during the task. This allowed us to isolate the unique contributions of RPEs to subjective affect over and above the effects gain/loss amount. Within this approach, we defined the outcome amount in terms of the gain/loss of points in each trial:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Outcome t = R t (chosen)<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where R t (chosen) is the reward received from the chosen card on trial t.</p><p>Reward prediction errors were defined as the difference between the actual reward and the mathematical expected value of the chosen card:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">RP E t = R t (chosen) − EV t (chosen)<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In turn, the expected value of the chosen card was calculated as a probabilityweighted average of the different possible outcomes of choosing that card:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">EV t (chosen) = 2 i=1 Pr(X i )V (X i )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where Pr(X i ) and V (X i ) are the probability and reward value of the ith possible outcome of the chosen card, respectively. These definitions of the appraisal variables explain the positive correlation between outcome amount and RPE that is typically observed: the reward amount R t (chosen) appears in both Equation 1 and 2, and the only difference between the two appraisals is the subtraction of expected value in Equation 2.</p><p>Modelling Framework. Data were analysed using hierarchical Bayesian computational modelling. We compared models in which the effects of appraisals on affect were allowed to vary as a function of their valence (i.e., differences in effect size of positive versus negative appraisals).</p><p>The Affective Slider on which participants reported their momentary subjective affect produced responses scaled between 0 and 1. As a consequence, we chose to model affect self-reports using a Beta distribution (in a mean-precision parameterisation). Specifically, a given participant's nth affect report, following trial t of the behavioural task, was modelled as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Affect n ∼ Beta(M n , ϕ) M n = w 0 + 4 i=0 γ i • Appraisals t−i (4)</formula><p>In other words, subjective affect reports were assumed to follow a Beta distribution with a mean given by M n and a precision given by the participant-specific precision parameter ϕ. In turn, M n was calculated as a sum of the participant-specific affect intercept parameter w 0 and a weighted sum of outcome appraisals over the preceding five trials. The participant-specific decay parameter γ controls the rate at which appraisals of outcomes from earlier trials 'wash out' of subjective affect: γ = 0 corresponds to extreme recency-weighting (only appraisals from the most recent trial contributes to subjective affect), and γ = 1 corresponds to no recency weighting (appraisals from all trials contribute equally to subjective affect).</p><p>This modelling framework is in keeping with (and inherits its notation from) other recent affect-modelling studies (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rutledge et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Blain &amp; Rutledge, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Keren et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chew, Blain, Dolan, &amp; Rutledge, 2021)</ref>. One distinction between our model and previous models, however, is that previous modelling approaches did not assume Beta-distributed affect self-reports as we did. As a robustness check, therefore, we also conducted supplementary analyses in which affect self-reports were instead assumed to be normally distributed.</p><p>Models were fit using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo as implemented in Stan (Stan Development Team, 2022). Specifically, we sampled from the joint posterior distribution of all parameters using 4 independent chains. Each chain took 1250 post-warmup samples (after a warmup period of 1750 samples), resulting in a total of 5000 posterior samples for analysis. There were no divergent transitions in any model, and all models fully converged (R &lt; 1.1). All models were fit using partial pooling, such that participant-level parameters were assumed to be generated from a Gaussian group-level parameter distribution with a mean and standard deviation that were estimated freely from the data. Parameters with finite support were sampled from an unconstrained latent space and then transformed to the appropriate domain (e.g., the decay parameter γ was transformed to fall between 0 and 1 using a probit transform; group-level standard deviation parameters were transformed to take on positive values using exponential transformations). All group-level parameters were given weakly informative prior distributions to prevent divergences during sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gelman et al., 2013)</ref>. In turn, all participant-level parameters (including the trial-type effects on each appraisal weighting parameter) were drawn from participant-specific prior distributions, with parameters of these participant-level distributions in turn drawn from the respective group-level distributions. To maximise sampling efficiency, group-level means and standard deviations were sampled using non-centred parameterisations <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(McElreath, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Summary of Models Compared. For Experiment 1 we compared nine distinct computational models. Models differed in terms of (a) the set of appraisals that influenced subjective affect (i.e., in the way that the Appraisals t variable was calculated), and (b) whether positive and negative appraisals of each kind (i.e., point gains vs. point losses, positive vs. negative RPEs) were assumed to be equivalent in the size of their effects on affect ('symmetric' models) or to have different effect sizes ('asymmetric' models). So, for example, Model M0 was a null model in which each participant was described only by an intercept parameter, with no effect of any outcome appraisals on subjective affect. By contrast, M2 models assumed that only the gain/loss amount on each trial influenced subjective affect (asymmetrically for model M2-asymm, symmetrically for model M2-symm), M3 models assumed only RPEs influenced subjective affect, et cetera. The benchmark for each of these models was the M1 model, a field-standard model proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rutledge et al. (2014)</ref> that has been widely used in recent years; all other models were novel and have not been previously tested in the literature. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> for an overview of models compared in Experiment 1, and Supplementary Section S4 for a detailed mathematical description of each model. As an illustration, the mathematical form of model M4-symm (involving symmetric effects of gain/loss amount and RPE) involves defining the Appraisals t variable from Equation 4 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Appraisals t = w outcome • Outcome t + w RP E • RP E t (5)</formula><p>Where w outcome and w RP E are participant-level model parameters governing affective reactivity to gain/loss outcomes and RPEs respectively.</p><p>Model Comparison and Group-Level Inference Criteria. The nine models presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> were compared using the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Watanabe &amp; Opper, 2010)</ref>. The WAIC value is a measure of model goodness-of-fit for hierarchical Bayesian models that approximates the leave-one-out cross-validated posterior predictive density of the model, balancing goodness-of-fit against model complexity. Using the loo package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Vehtari, Gelman, &amp; Gabry, 2017)</ref>, we computed each model's WAIC as well as its ∆WAIC (difference between WAIC and the WAIC of the best-fitting model) and the standard error of its ∆WAIC . Models with a ∆WAIC within one standard error of the best-fitting model were taken to be statistically equivalent to the best-fitting model.</p><p>Within the overall best-fitting model, we performed group-level parameter inference by quantifying the 95% Bayesian Highest Density Interval (HDI) for the mean of each group-level parameter distribution. For each of the appraisal parameters, a given appraisal was taken to have a statistically noteworthy effect if the 95% HDI did not include zero. Appraisal weighting parameters were allowed to vary as a function of trial type (and as a function of valence within asymmetric models), and so a similar approach was used to test whether any appraisal weightings varied at the group level as a function of trial type. In other words, the effect of trial type was included in the model as an interaction term on other appraisal regressors, and not as a main effect. Posterior predictive checks were used for the best-fitting model to verify the absolute goodness-of-fit to data.</p><p>Transparency and openness. We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions, all manipulations, and all measures in the study. All experimental data are available in a de-identified format in the project OSF repository at https://osf.io/m7dtw. Full Stan code for all computational models is also available in the OSF repository. The study's design and analysis methods were not preregistered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Before turning to computational modelling, we first used standard inferential statistics to analyse participants' behavioural responses and their affect self-reports within the task.</p><p>Behaviour in Risky Choice Task. Participants engaged well with the task, choosing the correct option on 98.2% of attention-check trials on average. Five participants (3.3% of sample) responded inaccurately to two or more of the 10 attentioncheck trials and were excluded from all further analysis. Across the task, participants won an mean of 2893.7 points (SD = 1710.4), equivalent to a mean bonus payment of $0.57 (SD = $0.30). Being able to choose freely was advantageous to participants, who earned significantly more on free-choice trials (17.1 points per trial) than on forced-choice trials (1.2 points per trial; t(144) = 10.83, p &lt; .001, paired-samples t-test).</p><p>As would be expected, on free-choice trials participants showed a strong preference for choice options that had higher average payout values: the choice option with a higher mean outcome was chosen on 76.5% of trials on average (β mean = 1.82, p &lt; .001, mixed-effects logistic regression). Participants were also somewhat risk-seeking, in the sense that the choice option with greater payout variance was chosen on 56.5% of free-choice trials across participants (β risk = 0.51, p &lt; .001).</p><p>Group-Level Properties of Self-Reported Affect. Participants' average self-reported affect on the probes embedded within the risky choice task was 0.52 (SD = 0.15) on a scale from 0 to 1. This average rating was not significantly different from the 'neutral' mid-point of the scale (β intercept = 0.02, p = .10). We also found no evidence for a group-level effect of time-on-task (β time = −0.01, p = .07; see Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S2A</ref>), indicating that mean affect levels were stable across the task. We also found evidence for a quadratic effect of time-on-task on the variance of subjective affect such that participants' self-reports were more variable at the beginning and end of the task, and more stable in the middle blocks of the task (β time 2 = 0.003, p = .001; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S4</ref>).</p><p>These group-level properties notwithstanding, however, there was substantial between-participants variability in the timecourse of affect across the task (see Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S2B</ref>). We next investigated the degree to which fluctuations in participants' subjective affect of individual participants could be explained by different outcome appraisals within the risky choice task.</p><p>Effects of Gain/Loss Amount on Subjective Affect. We first asked whether participants' subjective affect changed as a function of the gain/loss amounts (i.e., wins and losses of 'points') that occurred in the trials preceding each affect selfreport. For each self-report probe, we calculated the change in the participant's self-reported affect since the previous probe, and regressed this change in affect on each of the gain/loss amounts that occurred in the period between self-report probes. We found that gain/loss amounts had a strong and significant effect on participants' self-reported affect (β gain/loss = 0.67, p &lt; .001, mixed-effects linear regression), such that affect became more positive after trials in which a gain outcome occurred and became more negative after trials in which a loss outcome occurred (see <ref type="figure">Figure  2A</ref>). We also found a significant interaction between gain/loss amount and time lag (β = −0.14, p &lt; .001). This result indicates that participants' subjective affect in a given self-report probe was most strongly influenced by the gain/loss in the immediately preceding trial, whereas the effects of earlier gains and losses tended to decay as a function of the amount of time elapsed since they occurred (see Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S5</ref>). Reward prediction error Change in affect (controlling for gain/loss) D <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The effects of outcome appraisal on subjective affect (Experiment 1). A) There was a strong positive association between gain/loss amount received on the previous trial and changes in affect. B) There was also a strong positive association between reward prediction error (in points) on the previous trial and changes in affect. C) There was a strong trial-wise positive correlation between gain/loss amount and reward prediction error. Points are coloured according to the density of trials that within each unique pairwise combination of gain/loss and reward prediction error (brighter colours: more trials). D) After controlling for gain/loss amount, the strength of the association between reward prediction error and changes in affect was markedly diminished. Plots A, B, and D represent the mean ± 95% confidence interval (some very small error bars are obscured by plotted points); the y-axis represents change in subjective affect as a percentage of the length of the response slider (0% = no change since previous affect report).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Reward Prediction</head><p>Errors on Subjective Affect. We next considered whether participants' subjective affect was influenced by the reward prediction errors that they experienced during the risky choice task. When considered alone (i.e., entered as the only appraisal regressor in a mixed-effects linear regression analysis), reward prediction errors appeared to exert a considerable effect on participants' affect (β RPE = 0.49, p &lt; .001; see <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>). This result must be interpreted with caution, however, because of the strong positive correlation between the reward prediction error on each trial and the concurrent gain/loss amount (Pearson r = .84, p &lt; .001; <ref type="figure">Figure 2C</ref>). This correlation arises from the fact that in risky choice tasks, more positive reward prediction errors tend to occur on trials in which participants experience larger gains (or smaller losses). The reverse was true for negative reward prediction errors, which tended to occur after larger losses and smaller gains.</p><p>To conclude that there is an effect of RPEs on subjective affect, however, we suggest that it is necessary to show that RPEs account for fluctuations in subjective affect over and above the concurrent effects of gain/loss amount. To test this differential effect, which was one of the major focuses of this study, we ran an additional analysis in which both reward amount and RPE amount were simultaneously included as regressors. The results of this analysis suggested that the unique effect of RPEs was considerably smaller when the effects of reward amount were accounted for (β RPE | gain/loss = 0.06, p &lt; .01; see <ref type="figure">Figure 2D</ref>). Moreover, post-hoc tests suggested that any observable effects may have been restricted to negative RPEs: when data were dichotomised and analysed separately for positive and negative RPEs, we found a significant effect of previous-trial reward prediction error on affect only for negative RPEs (t(144) = −3.80, p &lt; .001), and not for positive RPEs (t(144) = 1.06, p = .29).</p><p>It is important to note, however, that in our analysis the interpretation of the 'reward prediction error' variable may differ slightly from the usual usage of this term, since we simultaneously controlled for the effect of reward amount. As such, the RPE variable captures variance associated with expectation violations, but not with reward magnitude. By contrast, usage of the RPE term elsewhere frequently does not distinguish between these two sources of variance.</p><p>Finally, as an additional test we investigated changes in subjective affect following decision outcomes in which there was a sign difference between reward amount and RPE (i.e., positive reward and negative RPE or negative reward and positive RPE). This analysis provides a model-agnostic measure of the relative importance of reward amount and RPE in changes in subjective affect. In line with the other results reported above, this analysis also suggested that the effect of reward amount was more substantial than the effect of RPE: participants' subjective affect improved by an average of 3.8% after trials with a positive reward amount but a negative RPE (t(137) = 4.36, p &lt; .001, one-sample t-test against 0), and deteriorated by an average of -3.9% after trials with a negative reward amount but a positive RPE (t(86) = −2.69, p &lt; .01).</p><p>We next turned to computational modelling to explicate the factors that gave rise to these effects.</p><p>Computational Modelling. Model Comparison. Results of the model comparison analysis are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>There are several noteworthy features of these model comparison results. First, the intercept-only null model M0 fit the data substantially worse than other models, providing further evidence that participants' subjective affect responded to events in the task. Second, across all sets of appraisals that were considered, asymmetric models fit the data better than their corresponding symmetric models. This indicates that, independent of the exact appraisal considered, pleasant and unpleasant events tended to influence participants' affect with different effect sizes. Thirdly, and in keeping with the model-agnostic regression analyses presented above, the best-fitting model overall was model M4-asymm, in which participants' subjective affect was (asymmetrically) influenced by both gain/loss amounts and reward prediction errors. This model outperformed competitors in which affect was assumed to be driven only by gain/loss amount (M2 models), only by RPEs (M3 models), or by a combination of RPEs and the expected value of the chosen option (M1 models; cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rutledge et al., 2014)</ref>. The WAIC statistic that we used to compare models is designed to identify the model that best trades off between goodness of fit and model complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Vehtari et al., 2017)</ref>; we can therefore conclude that our model selection results are not simply due to the greater complexity of the best-fitting model.</p><p>We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the extent to which our results were dependent on the choice of a Beta response function for participants' subjective affect reports. This sensitivity analysis revealed that an equivalent pattern of model comparison results was observed if models were instead fit with a Gaussian response function (see Supplementary Section S10); this demonstrates that the pattern of model comparison results that we observed is not dependent on our assumptions about the specific mathematical function governing participants' affect self-reports. Simulation-based posterior predictive checks ( <ref type="figure">Figure S7</ref>) indicated that models provided a good absolute fit to data; in particular, the best-fitting model was able to accurately capture the pattern of effects described above for trials in which the reward amount and the RPE had a different sign ( <ref type="figure">Figure S9)</ref>. Accordingly, the model comparison results presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> above were not materially altered when models were solely fit to trials in which reward amount and RPE had different signs (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Information, Section S12)</ref>.</p><p>Group-Level Parameter Estimates. To interpret these results further, we next turned to inspection of group-level parameter estimates for each of the model parameters of interest from the best-fitting model. See <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> for a comparison of the estimated effects of gains/losses and reward prediction errors within this model, Supplementary <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table S2</ref> for a full summary of model parameter estimates, and Supplementary <ref type="table">Table S6</ref> for correlations between individual participants' model parameters and individual-difference measures.</p><p>Within the winning model M4-asymm, we observed a substantial group-level effect of reward gains and losses on subjective affect (median w gain/loss = 0.14, 95% HDI [0.12, 0.16]). As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3A</ref>, we also found evidence for an interaction between trial type (free-versus forced-choice) and outcome valence (i.e., gains versus losses) such that participants' affective reactivity to gains was slightly stronger in free-choice trials compared with gains in forced-choice trials (median difference = 0.01, 95% HDI [0.002, 0.03]). By contrast, there was no evidence for a difference in affective reactivity to losses between free-and forced-choice trials (median difference = -0.004, 95% HDI [-0.02, 0.01]).</p><p>In comparison to the clear overall effects of reward amount, the group-level effects of RPEs on subjective affect within model M4-asymm were smaller and more nuanced ( <ref type="figure">Figure 3B</ref>). When comparing different trial types, we only observed evidence for an effect of negative RPE on subjective affect, and only on free-choice trials (median w − RPE for free-choice trials = -0.02, 95% HDI [-0.03, -0.01]). By contrast, there was no credible evidence for an effect of negative RPEs on affect in forcedchoice trials (median w − RPE for counterfactual trials = 0.003, 95% HDI [-0.01, 0.01]). There was no evidence for a group-level effect of positive RPEs on subjective affect in either trial type.</p><p>These results indicate that gain/loss amount-rather than RPEs-are the primary appraisal driving subjective affect, and that effects of RPEs might be smaller and more valence-and context-dependent. To test this conclusion, we also assessed which of the two predictors alone provided a better account of participants' subjective affect. We therefore compared model M2-asymm (in which only gain/loss amount was assumed to influence subjective affect) with model M3-asymm (in which only RPEs influenced subjective affect). This model comparison strongly favoured model M2-asymm (∆WAIC = 389.9, SE of difference = 32.2). In other words: when considered separately, the gain/loss amount that participants experienced provided a substantially better account of fluctuations in their subjective affect than the size of the RPEs that they experienced.</p><p>Addressing collinearity of appraisals. In our behavioural task, trial-bytrial rewards (gain/loss amount) and RPEs necessarily showed a strong positive corre-  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Computational model parameter estimates for best-fitting model (Experiment 1). A) Effects of gain/loss amount received on subjective affect (controlling for concurrent reward prediction errors). Gains (red) produced more pleasant subjective affect, and losses (blue) produced more unpleasant subjective affect. Effects were observed both when free-choice trials (darker colours) and in forced-choice trials (lighter colours), though the effect of gains on affect was slightly stronger in free-choice trials. B) Effects of reward prediction errors on subjective affect (controlling for concurrent gain/loss amount). Negative reward prediction errors (i.e., worse-than-expected outcomes; blue) produced more unpleasant subjective affect, but only in free-choice trials. Positive reward prediction errors (red) did not produce credible changes in subjective affect in either trial type. All estimates shown are the means of the group-level distribution for each parameter (presented as median and 95% Bayesian Highest Density Interval), as computed using samples from the joint posterior distribution (histograms).</p><p>lation. As such, one potential concern is that the results of our best-fitting computational model, which included both reward and RPE, may be unreliable because of the strong collinearity between appraisals. In general, it has been shown that Bayesian model-fitting procedures such as ours can be robust to predictor collinearity when they are endowed with appropriately informative priors <ref type="bibr">(Pesaran &amp; Smith, 2019)</ref>. To ensure that this was the case in our data, we conducted several additional analyses (reported in Supplementary Section S13), the results of which indicated that param-eter estimation within our computational models was robust against the presence of predictor collinearity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interim Discussion</head><p>The results of Experiment 1 suggest three important caveats to the proposal that reward prediction errors are the primary cognitive appraisal driving fluctuations in momentary subjective affect. First, we found that the effects of RPEs were smaller than has previously been assumed after accounting for the gain/loss amounts that occur concurrently with RPEs (i.e., when isolating the expectation-violation component of RPEs from the reward component). Second, we found that the valence of RPEs was a crucial factor in determining their effects on subjective affect: in freechoice trials, we only found evidence for a group-level effect of negative RPEs on subjective affect, and no evidence for a group-level effect of positive RPEs. Thirdly, we found that even this effect of negative RPEs was modulated by choice agency: negative RPEs influenced subjective affect only when the preceding choice was made freely by the participant, and there was no evidence for an effect of negative RPEs on subjective affect in forced-choice trials.</p><p>Given the discrepancy between these findings and some previous studies, we next sought to rule out the possibility that our findings were an artefact of the specific experimental design used in Experiment 1. Experiment 2 therefore sought to replicate and extend Experiment 1 using the same basic task design, but with a manipulation of a different aspect of decision context: the presence or absence of concurrent counterfactual feedback.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>In Experiment 2, we sought to determine whether the effects of RPEs on subjective affect differed between trials in which counterfactual information was presented and trials in which counterfactual information was not presented. This experiment was not preregistered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Participants. 150 adult participants (75 men, 75 men; M age = 34.8, SD = 11.3, range 18-65) were recruited to take part in Experiment 2 via Prolific. Participants who completed excluded from Experiment 2; otherwise, all inclusion/exclusion criteria and details of ethics approval were as per Experiment 1. All participants received a base payment of USD $5 upon completion of the experiment, followed by a bonus payment of up to $1 depending on their winnings in the risky choice task (M = $0.77, SD = 0.28).</p><p>Materials, Experimental Design, and Procedure. As in Experiment 1, before starting the behavioural task participants first completed a demographic questionnaire, the MacArthur subjective socioeconomic status scale, and the PERCI questionnaire.</p><p>The behavioural task in Experiment 2 was identical to the task in Experiment 1, but with several crucial modifications. Rather than free-choice versus forced-choices, all choices were made freely in Experiment 2. Instead, the primary experimental manipulation in Experiment 2 was whether counterfactual feedback on the outcome of the unchosen card was presented during the outcome phase (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1C)</ref>. In trials with counterfactual feedback, participants were shown both the outcome of the chosen card and the outcome of the unchosen card; in trials without counterfactual feedback, participants were shown only the outcome of the chosen card. Participants were instructed that they would only receive the points from their chosen card, and received advance information for each trial on what kind of feedback they would receive in the outcome phase (via a single-card or double-card visual icon presented between the two choice options). Participants completed 101 trials with counterfactual feedback, 101 trials without counterfactual feedback, and 10 attention-check trials (without counterfactual feedback) in a randomised order.</p><p>Computational Modelling. The computational modelling approach of Experiment 2 was largely identical to our modelling analyses in Experiment 1. The sole exception was that we formulated three additional families of computational models to account for the effects of counterfactual reward information on subjective affect. Counterfactual reward information was computed as the counterfactual reward difference (outcome of chosen card minus outcome of unchosen card):</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">CRD t = R t (chosen) − R t (unchosen)<label>(6)</label></formula><p>As such, the CRD appraisal took on positive (/negative) values when the outcome of the chosen card was better (/worse) than the outcome of the unchosen card. The additional models incorporating this appraisal were:</p><p>• M5 models (M5-asymm and M5-symm) assumed that subjective affect was produced by the appraisals of gain/loss amount and counterfactual reward difference (difference between actual reward amount and counterfactual reward amount; see Supplementary Section S7)</p><p>• M6 models (M6-asymm and M6-symm) assumed that subjective affect was produced by the appraisals of RPE and counterfactual reward difference</p><p>• M7 models (M7-asymm and M7-symm) assumed that subjective affect was produced by the appraisals of gain/loss amount, RPE, and counterfactual reward difference</p><p>We therefore fit and compared a total of 15 computational models in Experiment 2 (the nine models from Experiment 1 plus the six new models described above). As in Experiment 1, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis using a Gaussian response function rather than a Beta response function.</p><p>Transparency and openness.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Behaviour in Risky Choice Task. Once again, participants engaged well with the task, choosing the objectively correct option on 97.6% of attention-check trials on average. Eight participants (5.3% of sample) who responded inaccurately to two or more of the 10 attention-check trials were excluded from all further analysis. Across the task, participants won an mean of 4504.9 points (SD = 2010.7), equivalent to a mean bonus payment of $0.79 (SD = $0.26). There was no difference in average winnings between trials with versus without counterfactual feedback (t(141) = 0.25, p = .80, paired-samples t-test). There was also no significant difference in winnings on the subsequent trial as a function of whether or not participants received counterfactual feedback on the previous trial (t(141) = 1.55, p = .12, pairedsamples t-test).</p><p>Participants again showed a strong preference for choice options that had higher average payout values: the choice option with a higher mean outcome was chosen on 75.6% of trials on average (β mean = 1.74, p &lt; .001, mixed-effects logistic regression). As in Experiment 1, participants were also somewhat risk-seeking on average, such that the choice option with greater payout variance was chosen on 54% of trials on average across participants (β risk = 0.29, p &lt; .001).</p><p>In addition, we found evidence for a significant interaction between trial type and outcome risk (β = 0.06, p &lt; .05). This interaction was driven by an increased tendency for participants to choose higher-risk choice options on trials in which they knew they would subsequently receive counterfactual feedback (higher-risk option selected on 54.6% of trials) compared with trials in which they knew they would receive feedback only on the chosen option (higher-risk option selected on 53.4% of trials).</p><p>Group-Level Properties of Self-Reported Affect. Participants' average self-reported affect on the probes embedded within the risky choice task was 0.53 (SD = 0.17) on a scale from 0 to 1. Unlike in Experiment 1, this average affect rating was significantly better than the 'neutral' mid-point of the scale, β intercept = .03, p = .01. As in Experiment 1, we found no evidence for a significant effect of time on task on self-reported affect (β time = −.002, p = .53; see Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S2A)</ref>, and there was substantial between-participants variability in the timecourse of subjective affect across the task (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S2B</ref>). We also replicated the quadratic effect of time-on-task on the variance of subjective affect (β time 2 = 0.002, p &lt; .001; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S4</ref>).</p><p>Effects of Reward Amount on Subjective Affect. As in Experiment 1, we first considered whether participants' self-reports of their subjective affect were associated with preceding reward amounts. Once again, we found a significant overall effect of reward on participants' self-reported affect (β gain/loss = 0.65, p &lt; .001; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4A</ref>), and a significant negative interaction between reward amount and time lag (β = −0.14, p &lt; .001; see Supplementary <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S5A</ref>). A) There was a strong positive association between reward amount received on the previous trial and changes in affect. B) There was also a strong positive association between reward prediction error on the previous trial and changes in affect. C) After controlling for reward amount, the strength of the association between reward prediction error and change in affect was markedly diminished. All plots represent the mean ± 95% confidence interval (some very small error bars are obscured by plotted points); the y-axis represents change in subjective affect as a percentage of the length of the response slider (0% = no change since previous affect report).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Reward Prediction Errors on Subjective Affect.</head><p>As in Experiment 1, we found that an apparently large effect of reward prediction errors on subjective affect (β RPE = 0.48, p &lt; .001; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4B</ref>) was revealed to be significantly reduced after accounting for the effects of reward amount (β RPE | gain/loss = 0.08, p &lt; .001; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4C</ref>). As in Experiment 1, after accounting for the effects of reward amount in a stepwise regression, there was a significant effect of previous-trial reward prediction error amount on subjective affect only for negative reward prediction errors, t(141) = −4.57, p &lt; .001, and not for positive reward prediction errors, t(141) = 1.34, p = .18 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4C)</ref>. A similar pattern of effects was observed for the effects of negative but not positive counterfactual information on subjective affect after accounting for reward amount (see <ref type="figure">Supplementary Figure S6</ref>).</p><p>Finally, we once again assessed changes in affect following trials in which there was a sign difference between reward amount and RPE. Results replicated those of Experiment 1: participants' subjective affect improved by an average of 3.3% after trials with a positive reward amount but a negative RPE (t(133) = 5.14, p &lt; .001, one-sample t-test), and deteriorated by an average of -6.3% after trials with a negative reward amount but a positive RPE (t(70) = −4.14, p &lt; .001).</p><p>Computational Modelling. Model Comparison. Results of the model comparison analysis are presented in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. The best-fitting computational model for Experiment 2 was model M7-asymm, in which subjective affect was influenced by three appraisals: gain/loss amount, reward prediction error, and counterfactual reward difference. This model is identical to the best-fitting model from Experiment 1 (M4-asymm), plus an additional effect of counterfactual difference on subjective affect. Otherwise, model comparison results were broadly consistent with the pattern of results observed in Experiment 1.</p><p>Once again, a sensitivity analysis indicated that a qualitatively equivalent pattern of model comparison results was observed if models were fit with a Gaussian response function, rather than the Beta response function that was used in the models described above (see Supplementary Section S10). In addition, simulation-based posterior predictive checks ( <ref type="figure">Figure S8</ref>) indicated that models provided a good absolute fit to data. Moreover, as in Experiment 1, the model comparison results presented in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> were not materially altered when models were solely fit to trials in which reward amount and RPE had different signs (see Supplementary Information, Section S12).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group-Level Parameter Estimates.</head><p>As in Experiment 1, inspection of group-level parameter estimates from model M7-asymm indicated that participants' affect self-reports reports were strongly influenced by the gain/loss amount on each trial (median w reward = 0.11, 95% HDI [0.09, 0.13]; see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5A</ref>). This main effect interacted with trial type (counterfactual information versus no counterfactual information) and outcome valence (gains versus losses), such that affective reactivity to losses was stronger when counterfactual information was present and weaker when counterfactual information was absent (median difference = -0.02, 95% HDI [-0.03, -0.01]). By contrast, there was no difference in affective reactivity to gains between trials with versus without counterfactual feedback (median difference = 0.01, 95% HDI [-0.01, 0.02]).</p><p>As in Experiment 1, the effects of reward prediction error on subjective affect were smaller and more nuanced than the effects of gain/loss amount (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5B)</ref>. When comparing different trial types, we only observed evidence for an effect of negative reward prediction errors on subjective affect, and only when no counterfactual feedback was present (median w − RPE for no-counterfactual trials = -0.03, 95% HDI [-0.04, -0.02]). By contrast, when counterfactual feedback was present there was no credible evidence for an effect of negative reward prediction errors on affect (median w − RPE for counterfactual trials = -0.01, 95% HDI [-0.03, 0.002]). There was no evidence for an effect of positive reward prediction errors on subjective affect in either trial type. Group-level parameter estimates for model M7-asymm are reported in full in <ref type="table">Supplementary Table S3</ref>, and correlations between participant-level model parameters and individual-difference measures are presented in <ref type="table">Supplementary Table  S7</ref>.</p><p>Finally, we again specifically compared model M2-asymm (reward amount only) with model M3-asymm (reward prediction errors only). In line with the results of Experiment 1, this model comparison strongly favoured model M2-asymm (∆WAIC = . Gains (red) produced more pleasant subjective affect, and losses (blue) produced more unpleasant subjective affect. These effects were observed when counterfactual feedback was absent (darker colours) and when counterfactual feedback was present (lighter colours), though the effect of losses on affect was slightly stronger in trials with counterfactual feedback. B) Effects of reward prediction errors on subjective affect (controlling for concurrent gain/loss amount). Negative reward prediction errors (i.e., worse-than-expected outcomes) produced more unpleasant subjective affect, but only when counterfactual feedback was not concurrently presented. Positive reward prediction errors did not produce credible changes in subjective affect in either trial type. All estimates shown are the means of the group-level distribution for each parameter (presented as median and 95% Bayesian Highest Density Interval), as computed using samples from the joint posterior distribution (histograms).</p><p>313.7, SE of difference = 32.5). Once again, this suggests that reward amount was a better predictor of fluctuations in participants' reported affect than reward prediction error amount.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Recent computational models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rutledge et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Eldar &amp; Niv, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Eldar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bennett &amp; Niv, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bennett et al., 2021)</ref> propose that reward prediction errors (RPEs) are intimately linked with subjective emotional states, such that affect becomes more positive following events that are better than expected (positive RPEs) and becomes more negative following events that are worse than expected (negative RPEs). Across two experiments, the present study sought to extend our understanding of this association by appraising how outcome valence and decision context moderated the influence of RPEs on momentary subjective affect within a controlled cognitive task.</p><p>Our findings were twofold: first, we found that after accounting for the effects of concurrent reward amounts (gains/losses of points) on affect, the effects of RPEs were subtler and more nuanced than has been previously appreciated. Specifically, contrary to previous research, we found that only negative RPEs influenced subjective affect within our task, with no discernible effect of positive RPEs. Second, we found that even the effect of negative RPEs on affect was dependent on the decision context within which the RPEs occurred. We manipulated two features of decision context (Experiment 1: free-choice versus forced-choice trials; Experiment 2: trials with counterfactual feedback versus trials without counterfactual feedback) and found that both features of decision context significantly moderated the effect of negative RPEs on subjective affect. In Experiment 1, we found that negative RPEs only influenced subjective affect in free-choice trials, with no effect of negative RPEs in forced-choice trials. In Experiment 2, we similarly found that negative RPEs only influenced subjective affect when counterfactual feedback was absent, with no effect of negative RPEs when counterfactual feedback was present. We unpack and discuss each of these results separately below.</p><p>It is important to note that the risky choice task that we used in both experiments involved presenting participants with repeated decisions from description (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hertwig, Barron, Weber, &amp; Erev, 2004)</ref>. In tasks assessing decisions from description, all necessary information for making a decision is described to participants prior to the choice, and different choice options are presented on each trial. There is no requirement for reward learning in a task such as this because all relevant information about choice options is described to participants, and nothing must be learned from experience. In addition, since different choice options are presented on each trial, there are no consistently presented choice options about which participants can learn. As such, although RPEs as a computational variable are commonly associated with reward learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Niv, 2009)</ref>, in the present study RPEs were elicited within a paradigm within which no trial-by-trial reward learning was expected to take place.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The effect of RPEs on subjective affect depends on valence</head><p>In both experiments, before quantifying the effects of RPEs on subjective affect we conducted a model comparison analysis. Our rationale for conducting this analysis was, first, to identify which aspects of decision feedback had an overall effect on participants' subjective affect and, second, to determine whether these effects were symmetric (equal effect sizes for positive and negative appraisals) or asymmetric (unequal effect sizes). With respect to the first of these questions, in both experiments we found that the best-fitting computational model assumed that participants' subjective affect was driven by both the reward amount on each trial (i.e., the number of points gained or lost) and the associated RPE. This model outperformed simpler models that included only reward amount or only RPE, and also outperformed a field-standard benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rutledge et al., 2014)</ref>. In Experiment 2, the best-fitting model also included an effect of counterfactual reward difference (difference between the outcome that was received and the foregone outcome of the unchosen option), in line with a large body of research on regret and relief (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mellers et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Zeelenberg et al., 1998)</ref>.</p><p>With respect to our second question, we found that the best-fitting models across the board included an asymmetry in the effect sizes of positive versus negative appraisals on subjective affect. Notably, in both experiments this asymmetry was particularly pronounced for the effects of RPEs: we found evidence for a significant overall effect of negative RPEs, but we did not find any evidence that the effect of positive RPEs was significantly different from zero. In other words, worse-thanexpected outcomes had an influence on participants' subjective affect over and above the influence of the concurrent reward amount, but better-than-expected outcomes did not. For instance, a zero-point outcome (neither gain nor loss of points) would be predicted to have a negative effect on subjective affect if it followed a gamble that had a positive expected value (e.g., 50/50 gamble between 0-point gain and a 100point gain; a 0-point outcome creates a negative RPE, which negatively influences affect). By contrast, our modelling results predict that the same zero-point outcome would have no effect on subjective affect if it followed a gamble that had a negative expected value (e.g., a 50/50 gamble between a 100-point loss and a 0-point gain; a 0-point outcome would create a positive RPE, which does not influence affect). These asymmetries between positive and negative RPEs are in line with computational models proposing just such an asymmetry between positive and negative RPEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bennett &amp; Niv, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bedder, 2021)</ref>, as well as with empirical results reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bedder (2021)</ref>. More broadly, the stronger effect of negative RPEs is in line with a large body of literature demonstrating a 'negativity bias' in human affect, such that negative emotions tend have stronger effects on subjective affect and cognition than positive emotions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vaish, Grossmann, &amp; Woodward, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Browning, Holmes, &amp; Harmer, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Joseph et al., 2020)</ref>. Notwithstanding this effect, however, we did not observe a negativity bias in the effect of gain/loss outcomes. We speculate that this effect may be related to the finding that participants were risk-seeking in our behavioural task, rather than being risk-averse, as is more commonly observed.</p><p>Our results contrast with some previous studies of the effects of RPEs on subjective wellbeing, which found a more robust effect of both positive and negative RPEs on subjective affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rutledge et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Eldar &amp; Niv, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Eldar et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rutledge et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Keren et al., 2021)</ref>. We suggest that the primary reason for this discrepancy is that the present study simultaneously modelled the effects of both reward amount and RPE on subjective affect (an approach also taken by other previous studies; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mellers et al., 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mellers et al., , 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mellers, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Villano et al., 2020)</ref>. By contrast, the other previous studies cited above tested for the effects of RPE but not reward amount (though they may have inadvertently captured variance associated with reward amount by including appraisals related to expected value, which is positively correlated with reward amount). Although RPEs and reward amount are in principle separable aspects of decision feedback, in practice for most laboratory tasks they are highly correlated (r = .84 for our task). This strong positive correlation creates the potential for statistical confounding if models of subjective affect do not account for both reward amount and RPE amount. As a consequence, in previous computational models that did not include a reward amount parameter, the RPE model parameter is likely to have absorbed statistical variation in participants' subjective affect that was in fact caused by the reward rather than the RPE. In line with this interpretation, when we deconfounded these two effects in our computational models, we found that RPE effects were substantially smaller than the effects of reward amount (the effect size of negative RPEs was approximately 12% of the effect size of negative reward amounts). Moreover, we also found that changes in subjective affect following trials in which the reward amount and the RPE had a different sign were more strongly aligned with sign of the reward amount than the sign of the RPE (i.e., affect improved after feedback of a positive reward and a negative RPE; affect became more negative after feedback of a negative reward and a positive RPE).</p><p>One of the major aims of this study was to disentangle the effects of gain/loss amount on affect from the effects of RPE on affect. In our analyses of this question, we have tacitly assumed that an appropriate measure of the effects of RPEs on affect should quantify only unique variance explained by RPEs (i.e., variance that is not also explained by reward amount). One possible objection to this approach is that RPEs could be treated as a more fundamental appraisal given the ubiquity with which they are represented in the dopaminergic reward circuits of the brain (see Schultz, 2017 for review). However, we believe that our approach has both theoretical and empirical support. On theoretical grounds, we note that computation of an RPE in the brain itself requires that the reward amount be known: an RPE cannot be computed by the brain if there is no quantifiable reward amount to compare against prior reward expectations. Consequently, the reward amount variable is logically prior to RPEs, and must already be present in the neural system before an RPE can be computed. On empirical grounds, we also addressed this question via model comparison and found that a model with reward amount as the sole appraisal provided a substantially better account of participants' subjective affect than a model with RPE as the sole appraisal. This suggests that more unique variance in participants' subjective affect was accounted for by reward amount than by RPE, in line with our theoretical rationale.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that because of the collinearity of reward amount and RPE, the interpretation of the RPE appraisal-weighting parameter in the model differs according to whether or not reward amount is also included in the model. When reward amount is not included in the model (e.g., models M3asymm and M3-symm), the reward prediction error parameter accounts for variance related to both the effect of reward on affect and the effect of expectation violation on affect. By contrast, when reward amount is simultaneously included in the model, the RPE parameter solely accounts for variance related to expectation violation. Correspondingly, in the best-fitting model for each experiment (each of which included both RPE and reward amount), the RPE parameter estimate quantifies the effect of expectation violation alone, and therefore cannot be directly compared with the effect of RPE parameters in previous research that did not control for the effects of reward amount. Moreover, the distinction between the expectation-violation component of RPEs and the reward component of RPEs may relate to distinctions in the posited neurobiology of 'wanting' versus 'liking', with dopaminergic RPEs posited to be more strongly associated with the former <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Berridge &amp; Kringelbach, 2013)</ref>. Viewed from this perspective, the small overall effect of RPEs within our computational modelling may reflect a relatively minor contribution of dopaminergic signalling to subjective affect and wellbeing (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Nguyen et al., 2021)</ref>, in contrast to the large and welldocumented effects of dopaminergic activity on motivated behaviour (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Niv, Daw, Joel, &amp; Dayan, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In this respect, we note that our results also diverge from one other recent result that was obtained in a more naturalistic setting (momentary subjective affect among university students receiving their exam grades; <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Villano et al., 2020)</ref>. Contrary to our results, Villano and colleagues found that grade prediction error accounted for more variance in participants' subjective affect than grade alone. If we assume that grade amount is an exact proxy for reward amount as conceptualised in our task, there is therefore a discrepancy between these findings that must be explained. One candidate explanation is the difference in the 'stakes' of the outcomes between studies: in the present study, we measured changes in affect in response to relatively low-stakes rewards; by contrast, the exam outcome events studied by Villano and colleagues were likely to be much more personally meaningful to participants. It is possible that this difference might have produced a stronger effect of RPEs in the study by Villano and colleagues. However, this explanation would also accord with the present study in pointing to an additional role of decision context (in this case, outcome stakes) in moderating the strength with which RPEs influence subjective affect, as we discuss below. More broadly, we note that Villano and colleagues found that the best model of participants' affect include both grade and grade prediction error, similar to the best-fitting models from the present study. There is therefore agreement across studies that models including both reward amount and RPE outperform models with only reward amount or only RPE. Future research should assess whether the relative balance between reward amount effects and RPE effects on subjective affect is moderated by other aspects of decision context, such as the overall importance of the outcome to the individual. One way of implementing this would be to repeat the design of our study, but with higher-stakes reward outcomes. Separately, another difference in context is that students receiving their exam grades form expectations over a longer period of time, whereas participants in our studies formed expectations over shorter durations (less than 3 seconds, in most cases). Future research could also investigate the role of duration of expectation as an additional aspect of decision context that might moderate the effects of RPEs on subjective affect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The effect of RPEs on subjective affect depends on decision context</head><p>A second aim of the present study was to investigate whether decision context moderated the effects of RPEs on subjective affect. Across two separate manipulations of decision context, we found strong evidence in favour of this proposition. Taken together, these results provide evidence that decision context alters the effects of RPEs on affect. This result is consistent with appraisal theories of emotion, but in contrast to some recent computational models of affect that do not allow for RPEs to have different effects on subjective affect in different contexts as would be predicted by recent computational models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Rutledge et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Eldar &amp; Niv, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bennett &amp; Niv, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In Experiment 1, we manipulated whether participants were able to choose freely between the two choice options (free-choice trials) or had one of the two options chosen for them (forced-choice trials). Then, since the same choice options were shown in both trial types, we were able to model the effects of equivalently-sized RPEs on subjective affect separately in free-choice trials and forced-choice trials. This analysis revealed that there was a significant overall effect of negative RPEs in free-choice trials, but not in forced-choice trials. This contrasted with the effects of reward amount on subjective affect, which were significant for both gains and losses and for both free and forced-choice trials (with a slightly stronger effect of gain outcomes in free-choice trials). As such, we found that control over outcomes was a significant moderator of the effects of RPEs produced by those outcomes on subjective affect.</p><p>A moderating role for control is consistent with appraisal theories of emotion, which identify the degree of control one has over an event as being a crucial factor in the emotional response one has to that event (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Smith &amp; Ellsworth, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lerner &amp; Keltner, 2000)</ref>. Control is also implicated in a number of other affective and cognitive processes, including the assignation of blame and responsibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Weiner, 1982)</ref>, the harshness of punishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Averill, 1982)</ref>, and the evaluation of success and failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Betancourt, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Weiner &amp; Kukla, 1970)</ref>. Each of these findings implies that the degree control an individual has over an outcome may moderate the effects that other appraisals have on subjective affect, consistent with our findings.</p><p>In addition, the findings of Experiment 1 bear an interesting resemblance to findings reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cockburn, Collins, and Frank (2014)</ref>, who found that the ability to freely choose between options amplified the effects of positive RPEs on reinforcement learning. By contrast, our findings implicated control as an important moderator of the effects of negative RPEs. It is not immediately clear why free-choice conditions might amplify the behavioural consequences of positive RPEs while amplifying the emotional consequences of negative RPEs. However, given that the effects observed by Cockburn and colleagues were specific to gain-domain outcomes (as distinct from the mixed gain-and loss-domain outcomes employed in the present study), one possibility is that the moderating effects of control on RPE processing might further depend on outcome domain (gain versus loss versus mixed). Future research could investigate this question.</p><p>In Experiment 2, we employed a different manipulation of decision context: here, participants chose freely in all trials and we manipulated whether counterfactual feedback was presented during the outcome phase of each trial. In half of trials, participants viewed the outcome of the chosen card only (counterfactual feedback absent); in the other half of trials, they were shown the outcomes of both the chosen card and the unchosen card (counterfactual feedback present). The counterfactual feedback allowed participants to learn what would have happened if they had made a different choice (cf. Palminteri, Lefebvre, Kilford, &amp; Blakemore, 2017), but did not change the magnitude of the RPE, which depends only on the expected value of the chosen card and the outcome of the chosen card <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Rutledge et al., 2014)</ref>. We found that negative RPEs only influenced subjective affect when counterfactual feedback was absent; by contrast, there was no evidence for an effect of negative RPEs on subjective affect on trials in which counterfactual feedback was provided. The presence of counterfactual feedback also did not weaken the effect of the reward amount from the chosen card on subjective affect: in fact, we found that the effect of loss outcomes on affect were significantly stronger in the presence of counterfactual feedback than in its absence. It remains unclear what the underlying psychological explanation of this effect is, though it may be related to previous research showing that the mere presence of salient counterfactual information after negative feedback introduces distortions in outcome memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Petrocelli, Seta, &amp; Seta, 2013)</ref>. More broadly, it is an open question how the effects of counterfactual feedback on subjective affect might be affected by other aspects of decision context, such as a free/forced-choice manipulation like that of Experiment 1. Future research could investigate this question.</p><p>Why might RPEs influence subjective affect only when counterfactual feedback is absent? One recent theory, the Integrated Advantage model of mood , may account for this finding. The Integrated Advantage model assumes that human mood reflects a moving average of an agent's estimates of the 'Advantage' of its recent actions, where Advantage is a quantity from theoretical reinforcement learning defined as the value of an action relative to the value of the state of the world within which the action was taken <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baird, 1994)</ref>. Both counterfactual reward difference (actual minus counterfactual reward) and RPEs can be used to estimate the Advantage of an action, and as such the Integrated Advantage model can account for effects of both appraisal types on subjective affect. However, the Integrated Advantage model also predicts that the relative weight on RPEs should differ depending on whether counterfactual feedback is present or absent, because on average counterfactual reward difference is a more accurate measure of Advantage than is the RPE (see <ref type="bibr">Bennett et al., 2021, pp. 520-521)</ref>. As such, the Integrated Advantage model predicts that the RPE should influence affect more strongly when counterfactual information is absent, in line with the results of the present study. However, it should be noted that the Integrated Advantage model predicts this effect for both positive and negative RPEs, contrary to our findings. As such, although it can in principle account for the interaction between RPE and trial type in Experiment 2, the Integrated Advantage model cannot completely account for the results of the present study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Recent computational theories propose a central role for reward prediction errors in driving subjective affect. In this study, we investigated whether the effects of reward prediction errors on subjective affect differed as a function of their valence or of the decision context in which they occurred. Our results showed that both factors significantly moderated the effects of RPEs on subjective affect. In particular, after accounting for reward amount we found that only negative RPEs influenced subjective affect. Moreover, this effect of negative RPEs was present only in free-choice settings, and only where counterfactual feedback was not presented. These results extend our understanding of the role of expectation violation in subjective emotional responses.
