			<abstract>
				<p>In recent years, the probing of cognitive processes underpinning choice in continuous-outcome space paradigms has attracted the attention of modeling researchers to provide a dynamic decision theory of speed and accuracy. One of the most important of these continuous models is the circular diffusion model (CDM, Smith (2016)) which assumes a noisy accumulation process, described mathematically as a stochastic two-dimensional Wiener process on the interior of a disk. Despite the significant advantages of this powerful model, however, due to its mathematical complexity, very few researchers have used the CDM in their work. Here, we propose a simple and easy-to-use method for estimating the CDM parameters and fitting the model on continuous scale data by simple formulas that can be computed easily and needs neither theoretical knowledge of model fitting nor much programming skills. Despite being simple and easy, we show that the method surprisingly works with precision near the maximum likelihood estimation method. Also, we introduce a robust version of the method that is still simple but is almost immune to the contaminant responses. Finally, the actual use of the method for experimental data is given with an example of using the method, alongside estimation of guess probability in data. It is hoped that this simple approach introduced here can, on the one hand, take a step towards bridging the gap between theory and experimental data falling along a continuum, on the other hand, can encourage cognitive psychology researchers to move their laboratory research toward continuous response paradigms.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Experimental data in cognitive psychology are usually taken from tasks that involve decision-making by subjects of the experiments between a small number of options (most often, sets of 2-3), many alternatives, or along a continuum. Sometimes, the bare choices of the participants in these tasks are not enough for making conclusions about the latent process of interest in the research. For instance, such situations can arise when the research is about some temporal stage of decision making (like the time taken by a specific cognitive process), or when the data is affected by the intrinsic criterion setting controlling the trade-off between speed and accuracy of performance. In such cases, a dynamic cognitive model of the decision-making time course could be of great help.</p><p>Evidence accumulation models (also known as sequential sampling models) are a class of speeded decisionmaking models that consider deciding as a gathering of information over time for possible choice options <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Stone, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Ratcliff, 1978)</ref> and can assess both the response time and accuracy simultaneously. Most successful of these models, consider this information accumulation as a stochastic process, continuous on the evidence space and time. More precisely, in these models stimulus information is continuously sampled, with each sample contributing a quantity of evidence favoring one or more response alternatives. The evidence from successive samples is summed, or accumulated through time until a criterion amount of evidence for one response alternative is accrued, initiating a behavioral response for that alternative. The important influential parameters in these models are the systematic tendency of the stochastic process to approach each alternative (called drift rate) as the relative speed of information accumulation in favor of alternatives, the criterion as the amount of information needed to choose each alternative (called threshold), and all the time taken for processes other than evidence accumulation such as encoding stimulus and executing response (called non-decision time). Many models in the framework of evidence accumulation have been developed for the two alternative decision tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Heath, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Usher and McClelland, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Heathcote, 2005, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Drugowitsch et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hawkins et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Voss et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Tillman et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Shinn et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hawkins and Heathcote, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">MiletiÄ‡ et al., 2021)</ref> which are extensively used in vast areas of clinical and experimental psychology such as evaluating the sustained attention in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Huang-Pollock et al., 2020)</ref>, the role of speed in ADHD-related working memory deficits <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Weigard and Huang-Pollock, 2017)</ref>, the pattern of information processing in children with ADHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Nejati et al., 2022)</ref>, perceptual decision-making in autistic children <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Manning et al., 2022a)</ref>, visual motion and decision-making in dyslexia <ref type="bibr">(Manning et al., 2022b)</ref>, the optimality of decision policies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bogacz et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Drugowitsch et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Evans et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Evans and Brown, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Evans et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Starns and Ratcliff, 2012)</ref>, stop signal paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Matzke et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Matzke et al., , 2017a</ref>, Go/No-Go paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Gomez et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ratcliff et al., 2018)</ref>, learning strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Pedersen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Fontanesi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Sewell et al., 2019)</ref>, attentional choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Krajbich et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Krajbich et al., , 2012</ref>, neural processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gold and Shadlen, 2007)</ref> and so on (interested readers can also refer to these two reviews, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Ratcliff et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Forstmann et al. (2016)</ref>).</p><p>While the two alternative decision tasks (two-choice tasks) are extensively used in the history of cognitive psychological research in laboratory, there has been a growing interest in using tasks that involve deciding among many alternatives or along a continuum (continuous report tasks). Although the two-choice tasks are repeatedly validated, easily implemented, simple enough for participants, have tractable cognitive models with interpretable parameters, sometimes they seem to lack naturality for the specified cognitive process in research, or miss the desired information because of being limited to binary (or even trinary) choices. Recent applications of continuous report tasks represent interesting results that would be very hard or maybe even impossible to deduce by the means of two-choice tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Zhang and Luck, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bays et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fougnie and Alvarez, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bays et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fougnie et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">van den Berg et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Marshall and Bays, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fan and Turk-Brown, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kool et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Swan and Wyble, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">van den Berg et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Ma et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Gunseli et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Green and Pratte, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Preliminary results show that the cognitive processes underlying decision nature actually influence subjects' performance in continuous report paradigms. For example, instruction or reward could change performance traced to be the result of speed-accuracy strategy setting (experiment 8 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ratcliff (2018)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kvam (2019b)</ref>). Alongside different performance in conditions, it is expected to be a difference among individuals in terms of these underlying cognitive processes. So such processes alter the data and should be considered when comparing the performance of different subjects or conditions, demonstrating the need for a computationally tractable dynamic theory of the decision processes like evidence accumulation models in continuous report paradigms.</p><p>In recent years, theories of evidence accumulation class have been developed for continuous decision tasks by quantifying choices and response times in terms of meaningful cognitive variables. To the best of our knowledge, the first and simplest theory is the circular diffusion model (CDM) for a frequently used subclass of continuous decision tasks in which the response is made on a circle (circular decision tasks) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Smith, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Smith and Corbett, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Smith, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kvam, 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Smith et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Zhou et al., 2021)</ref>. The circular diffusion model is based on the same theory of evidence accumulation models but extended to the continuous outcome decisions and has almost the same parameters. It represents information accumulation as a stochastic 2D Wiener diffusion process on the interior of a disk whose bounding circle represents the decision criterion. Another model is the spatially continuous diffusion model which is a more general model in terms of the number of parameters and the inclusion of more underlying cognitive processes in the model <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Ratcliff, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2020)</ref>. Also, other models have been introduced such as the geometric similarity representation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kvam and Turner, 2021)</ref> which is in a sense a synthesis of the previous two models, as well as the multiple anchored accumulation theory  which considers the role of reference points in the stimulus spectrum.</p><p>Despite the significant advantages of these powerful continuous models for explaining the experimental data in continuous scale tasks based on underlying psychological meaningful processes, however, due to their mathematical complexity, very few researchers have used them practically in their work, and the prevalence of these theories in cognitive research to understand the underlying mechanisms has not yet begun in earnest so cognitive researchers still prefer to use experiments with a limited number of options. In fact, with a careful lens, we realized that a major drawback in the popular use of these models amongst psychologists is perhaps the practical difficulties that arise in fitting the model to data and estimating the parameter values that are assumed to generate the data by the model. To overcome this critical challenge, two solutions can be suggested to take the next steps in this field, one is to provide a software package to fit joint distributions of response time and circular response errors, and the other is to provide a simpler but stronger and faster fitting approach. To the best of our knowledge, at the time of writing, no packages are available yet. So we focus on the second approach here.</p><p>Different methods have been used in fitting cognitive models to experimental data. Conventionally, the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) would be a suitable method in terms of the difference between the estimated values and the actual data generating values of parameters <ref type="bibr">(read Stigler (2007)</ref> for the historical story behind the MLE). This method consists of finding the parameter values that the production probability of the observed data by those values (called likelihood function) becomes maximum. However, using this method can be difficult in practice, because in addition to requiring some knowledge about fitting routine and programming skills to some degree which remains the use of this approach for only experts, it would be somewhat challenging to calculate the likelihood function to a desirable precision or to use an effective optimization algorithm to maximize the likelihood. Although in some cases like when the model belongs to the exponential family, the maximum likelihood estimates could be derived from simple equations (see section 2.4 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bishop (2006)</ref>). Another traditionally used estimation technique is the method of moments (the method can be traced back to <ref type="bibr">Pearson (1894)</ref>). In this method, estimates of parameters are obtained by solving a system of equations. Two sides of the equations are the moments of the data and the model. The method is very simple but it is expected to lack ideal accuracy in estimation as it only uses some statistics of data that maybe are not sufficient for accurate estimation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wagenmakers et al. (2007)</ref> used this approach to overcome the challenge of fitting the Ratcliff model <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Ratcliff, 1978)</ref> in two-choice decisions, which is much simpler than the CDM, by introducing a simple approach named the "EZ diffusion model". In the EZ diffusion model, the parameters were calculated from summary statistics of data by quite simple formulas (please see <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Wagenmakers et al. (2008)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wagenmakers (2009)</ref>; van <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Ravenzwaaij and Oberauer (2009)</ref>; van Ravenzwaaij et al. (2017) for more details).</p><p>Here, we introduce a EZ method for estimating the parameters of the CDM, named EZ-CDM, using both of the above methods, i.e. MLE and method of moments, which is very simple, fast, accurate, and easy to implement. We use the MLE whenever we could obtain a simple closed-form formula for the estimation, and when we could not, we turn to the method of moments. This makes the method to be as accurate as it can while sticking to simplicity. However, the problem is that the method may suffer from the lack of accuracy induced by the method of moments part. We analyzed the extent of this problem here. Another problem that the method could suffer from, is the inclusion of some contaminated data. We investigated the problem and proposed a robust version of the method, named robust EZ-CDM, that could deal with the contamination. Also, an example of using the estimation method for the mixed model of the CDM and guess is introduced.</p><p>The rest of the article is arranged as follow: In Section 2, the CDM is briefly discussed. Section 3 involved the method of moments used for CDM parameter estimation to introduce the EZ-CDM. The parameter recovery for the method is given and compared to the MLE in Section 4. Section 5 consists of the analysis for the impact of contaminants on the method. The usage of the method in company with the method for separating guest data is represented in Section 6 on experimental data. The article is ended with a discussion and conclusion in Sections 7 and 8, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Circular Diffusion Model</head><p>As mentioned before, the circular diffusion theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Smith, 2016)</ref> is a member of the evidence accumulation class that models the dynamic process of the decision-making procedure in a circular decision task. In these experimental tasks, the decision alternatives are arranged on a circle from which the participants of the task have to choose one point. So, the nature of the responses in these tasks is of a continuous type that extreme options are naturally bound together (i.e. there is no extreme). Direction, orientation, or color (when represented in wheel) are of this type (for example see tasks in <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Unsworth et al. (2014)</ref>). The performance of participants in each trial could be coded as a couple of the response time with the angle of the response on the circle (or the angular difference between the response and the correct option, if the data are aggregated for different correct options). An example of a color task popular in visual working memory research <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Zhang and Luck, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bays et al., 2009)</ref>, along with the model representation for a single trial, is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The subject is asked to choose the color of the probed square by moving the mouse pointer to a position on the circle. (c) The CDM model assumes that the process of decision making consists of a Wiener diffusion process on the plane with a drift vector v, representing the encoded stimulus in memory. The process runs until it hits the boundary circle of radius a. (d) The hitting point determines the decided color and the response time is determined by the time it takes for the process to hit the boundary plus non-decision time T er . In this model, the belief or evidence space is represented in a two-dimensional plane where each point represents a possible state that the accumulated evidence could be in, during the process of the decisionmaking.</p><p>An important aspect of the CDM is representing the accumulated evidence for all options with a single point which can be thought of as a strong restricting assumption in the form of possible joint amounts of evidence for all options. Following the intuition of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kvam (2019a)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kvam and Turner (2021)</ref> consider this restriction as a similarity function between options which is considered to be the cosine of the angle between two options. Considering this, it would be more convenient to consider the state point in polar coordinate which yields that the accumulated evidence for option Î¸ will be the length of the projection of the current state point on the unit vector of that option (which equals the multiplication of state point length and the similarity function between state angle and Î¸):</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s cos(Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ s ),</formula><p>where s and Î¸ s are respectively the length and angle of the state point. This function has a peak on the Î¸ s with the value of s. So, the angle of the state point can be considered as a representation of the option with the maximum gathered evidence so far, and the magnitude of the point is an indication of the amount of the gathered evidence for this option. See <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for illustration. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>: Relation between the state point and the accumulated evidence for all options following the interpretation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kvam and Turner (2021)</ref>. The plot on the left-hand side shows the evolution of the state point in the plane. The plot on the right-hand side shows the accumulated evidence for all options in some equally spaced times from the start of the process till its end.</p><p>The evidence state starts from an initial point (usually the origin is considered as it's assumed to be no initial evidence or tendency to any option before the start of the process) and changes according to the incoming or processed information over time. The CDM assumes that this new incoming information at each time point changes the state-point location in the plane to a nearby stochastic point. The location change follows a fixed probability distribution that is identical for all time and evidence states and statistically independent of the amount of change in other time points (characteristic properties of the diffusion process). These properties seem to be natural for the evidence accumulated for each option, but it may be somewhat confusing and challenging to attribute these properties to a single point representing the state of the accumulated evidence for all options. Yet, the dynamic of the angle and magnitude of the state-point seems to agree with the above interpretations of them. For instance, the change of the angle is more intense when the magnitude of the point is low, as we expect to have bigger shifts in the best option when its amount of evidence is low, compared to the situation where the option has a high magnitude and evidence support.</p><p>The dynamic of the state point in the real plane is considered to follow a diffusion process. This process can be represented as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X(t) = âˆ’ â†’ v t + Î£W (t),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where X(t) is the state point in the plane at time t, W (t) is a two-dimensional Wiener diffusion process, and âˆ’ â†’ v (called drift rate vector) and Î£Î£ are respectively the mean vector and the variance-covariance matrix of X(t) distribution (Î£ is the transpose of the Î£). Based on the fact that writing the above equation in Cartesian coordinates may help to understand them, it can be rewritten as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">X 1 (t) X 2 (t) = v 1 v 2 t + Î£ 1,1 Î£ 1,2 Î£ 2,1 Î£ 2,2 W 1 (t) W 2 (t) .</formula><p>So, the process in each dimension is a diffusion process. See chapter 10 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Ross (2007)</ref> for an introduction to diffusion process. The responses of the participants in psychological tasks are usually variable (even for the identical trials). To account for this result, the CDM represents this variability in the stochastic nature of the state change over time. It results from the above equation that the mean vector and variance-covariance matrix of location change distribution in time âˆ†t will be âˆ’ â†’ v âˆ†t and Î£Î£ âˆ†t. Since the angular symmetry (which seems natural assumption in most cases) the Î£ is taken to equal ÏƒI where I is the identity matrix. Therefore, the Ïƒ 2 indicates the amount of variability which accumulates over time, independently for two dimensions. Also, the drift rate vector can be considered the representative of the systematic tendency of state change over time. The state point tends to change in the direction of the drift rate direction and to the amount of drift rate length in unit time. So it seems natural to interpret the drift angle (represented as Î¸ v ) as the average noiseless response identity, and consider the drift rate length (represented as v) as the intensity of that response. The relationship between the polar and Cartesian coordinates for drift rate vector is as follow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">v 1 = v cos Î¸ v , v 2 = v sin Î¸ v , ï£± ï£² ï£³ Î¸ v = atan2(v 2 , v 1 ), v = v 2 1 + v 2 2 ,</formula><p>where atan2 function is an arctangent function with two arguments that gives the angle whose cosine and sine ratio and signs are identical to the ratio and signs of the arguments in respective order.</p><p>Considering the interpretation of the state point magnitude, it is natural to take the termination condition of the decision process to be the reaching of the point magnitude to a threshold (represented as a) which means the reach of the accumulated evidence of the best option to a satisfactory level of choosing it <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kvam, 2019b)</ref>. So the termination occurs when the state point reaches a circle of radius a around the origin. The response is predicted to be the angle of the hitting point, and the response time is the sum of the time taken to hit the circle, plus the non-decision time (represented as t 0 ). Please see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> which represents the accumulating evidence on a single experimental trial.</p><p>As a final point, note that the model in its current form lacks parameter identifiability. Since multiplying v, a, and Ïƒ by a constant term, would not change the predictions of the model. To restrict the model, usually, the diffusion coefficient is taken to be constant although other types of restriction could be used when having evidence to do so in the particular situation at hand. Throughout this paper, we consider Ïƒ = 1. For other types of restrictions, the equations should be reconsidered.</p><p>In sum, the circular diffusion model has the following parameters:</p><p>â€¢ Drift angle represented by Î¸ v , with the psychological meaning of the average noiseless inner response identity.</p><p>â€¢ Drift rate length represented by v, with the psychological meaning of intensity of that response.</p><p>â€¢ Threshold represented by a, with the psychological meaning of the satisfactory level of evidence for choosing.</p><p>â€¢ Non-decision time represented by t 0 , with the psychological meaning of the time other than the evidence accumulation process in decision making.</p><p>The specific quantitative values of these parameters will result in a specific joint choice angle and response time pattern.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EZ-CDM</head><p>The practical use of the CDM involves estimating the parameter values of the model, assumed to produce the experimental data. If the data are produced exactly by the model (although this never happens), the maximum likelihood method would be a good choice for estimating the parameters from the data. As mentioned in the introduction, generally, this method requires calculating the likelihood function with a desirable precision and also using an appropriate optimization algorithm on the likelihood function which could be challenging and require mathematical, algorithmic, and programming skills to implement. This is the case also for the CDM. Sometimes, the maximum likelihood estimate could be derived from a closed-form formula of data. For example, the maximum likelihood estimate of a normal model (family of normal distributions), parameterized by its mean and variance, could be derived as the mean and variance statistics of data points (see section 2.3.4 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bishop (2006)</ref>). In such cases, there is no need to calculate the likelihood or use an optimization algorithm. However, generally, the mean and variance of data do not give the maximum likelihood estimate (parameterized by mean and variance of likelihood function), when the model is not normal. Despite this, it still can give roughly good estimates which causes a reasonable accuracy in the performance of the method of moments. In the method of moments, the k parameters of a model are being estimated in such a way that the first k moments of the data and the model become equal (mean of X i is the i th moment).</p><p>In this section, we propose the EZ-CDM that allows the estimation of the CDM parameters from some simple statistics of the data (mean of choice angle (M CA), variance of choice angle (V CA), mean of response time (M RT ), and variance of response time (V RT )). To do so, we try to construct a system of 4 equations by using the possible closed-form MLE and the method of moments. We build our first two equations using MLE on choice angle data and the next two equations are based on using the method of moments on the response time data. Then we solve the equations for the parameters of the model (drift rate angle Î¸ v , drift rate magnitude v, threshold a, and non-decision time t 0 ) which completes the parameter estimation procedure.</p><p>The likelihood function for the CDM is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Smith (2016)</ref> as an infinite series that when written in the form of polar coordination, becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">P r(Î¸, t) = 1 2Ï€a 2 exp va cos(Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ v ) âˆ’ v 2 (t âˆ’ t 0 ) 2 Ã— âˆž i=1 j 0,i J 1 (j 0,i ) exp âˆ’ j 2 0,i 2a 2 (t âˆ’ t 0 ) ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Î¸ and t are choice angle and response time, J 1 is the first-order Bessel function of the first kind and j 0,i is the i th zero of the zero-order Bessel function of the first kind. The equation above can be rewritten as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P r(Î¸, t) = 1 2Ï€I 0 (av) exp va cos(Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸ v ) Ã— I 0 (av) a 2 âˆž i=1 j 0,i J 1 (j 0,i ) exp âˆ’ (t âˆ’ t 0 ) 2 (v 2 + j 2 0,i a 2 ) ,</formula><p>where I 0 is the first kind modified Bessel function of order zero. The first term is a probability function (integrates to one) and depends only on the Î¸ (not t), and the second term depends only on t (not Î¸). Therefore the first and second terms are respectively the marginal probability of Î¸ and t. Hence, we can write as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">P r(Î¸, t) = P r(Î¸) Ã— P r(t),</formula><p>which yields that the choice angle and response time are independent. So the coincide of them is not important and we treat the choice and response time data separately. The marginal probability of choice angle, makes a family of distributions called von Mises (see Section 3.5.4 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mardia and Jupp (1999)</ref> for more information about this distribution) whose likelihood has the form: P r(Î¸) = e Îº cos(Î¸âˆ’Âµ) /2Ï€I 0 (Îº), which Âµ and Îº are mean and concentration (acts as inverse of dispersion) parameters. So the relation between parameters of the CDM and von Mises is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Âµ = Î¸ v , Îº = av.</formula><p>It is known that the maximum likelihood estimate of von Mises parameters should satisfy the equations (see Section 5.3.1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mardia and Jupp (1999)</ref></p><formula xml:id="formula_8">): ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ Âµ = atan2 1 N N n=1 sin Î¸ n , 1 N N n=1 cos Î¸ n , 1 âˆ’ I 1 (Îº) I 0 (Îº) = 1 âˆ’ 1 N N n=1 cos Î¸ n 2 + 1 N N n=1 sin Î¸ n 2 ,</formula><p>where I 1 is the first kind modified Bessel function of order one, N is the number of data points, and Î¸ n is the choice angle in the n th trial. The right side of equality in the first equation above is called the circular mean of data. Also, the right side of equality in the second equation is called the circular variance of data (see Chapter 2 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mardia and Jupp (1999)</ref>). The left side of equalities in the equations above shows the circular mean and variance of the von Mises distribution (see Section 3.5.4 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mardia and Jupp (1999)</ref>). So in a sense, MLE for the von Mises family of distributions is equivalent to the method of moments and like the Normal model in data on the real line, in angular data, the maximum likelihood estimates for the von Mises model (when parameterized by its mean and variance), equals to the mean and variance of data.</p><p>Replacing the von Mises parameters with the CDM parameters will yield our first two equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ Î¸ v = atan2 1 N N n=1 sin Î¸ n , 1 N N n=1 cos Î¸ n , 1 âˆ’ I 1 (av) I 0 (av) = 1 âˆ’ 1 N N n=1 cos Î¸ n 2 + 1 N N n=1 sin Î¸ n 2 .</formula><p>Now we need two more equations to be able to solve for our 4 parameters. For this, we will turn into the response time data and build equations by using the first two moments of the model and data. The marginal probability of response time is the first passage time of a Bessel process of order two depending on a non-zero drift rate length (plus the non-decision time t 0 ) (see Section 4.6 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Borodin and Salminen (2002)</ref> for information about the Bessel process). This distribution has the moment generating function (Laplace transform) (see Appendix C in Smith (2016)) that if we add t 0 , will be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">E[e âˆ’Î»t ] = e âˆ’Î»t0 I 0 (av) I 0 a âˆš 2Î» + v 2 .</formula><p>This function can help to derive formulas for moments of response time (read Section 2.3 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Casella and Berger (2001)</ref>). The first moment will be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">E[T ] = âˆ’ d dÎ» E[e âˆ’Î»t ] Î»=0 = t 0 + a v I 1 (av) I 0 (av) ,</formula><p>where we have used the fact that ( d /dx)I 0 (x) = I 1 (x). Also, the second moment will be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">E[T 2 ] = d 2 dÎ» 2 E[e âˆ’Î»t ] Î»=0 = 1 I 4 0 I 4 0 t 2 0 + 2 a v I 3 0 I 1 t 0 + 2 a v 3 I 3 0 I 1 âˆ’ a 2 v 2 I 4 0 + 2 a 2 v 2 I 2 0 I 2 1 ,</formula><p>where all Bessel functions are calculated at av and superscripts are exponents. Also it should be noted that we used the fact that</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">( d /dx)I 1 (x) = I 0 (x) âˆ’ I 1 (x)/</formula><p>x in the above calculations. Usually, researchers are more comfortable with the mean and variance, instead of the first two moments (although the two values, can be calculated from the other two values). So we convert the formulas to mean and variance. The mean equals the first moment and the variance can be calculated from first two moments as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">E[T 2 ] âˆ’ E[T ] 2 = a 2 v 2 I 2 1 (av) I 2 0 (av) + 2a v 3 I 1 (av) I 0 (av) âˆ’ a 2 v 2 .</formula><p>So, the estimation procedure will begin by calculating these statistics of data (mean of choice angle (M CA), variance of choice angle (V CA), mean of response time (M RT ), and variance of response time</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(V RT )): ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ M CA = atan2 1 N N n=1 sin Î¸ n , 1 N N n=1 cos Î¸ n , V CA = 1 âˆ’ 1 N N n=1 cos Î¸ n 2 + 1 N N n=1 sin Î¸ n 2 , M RT = 1 N N n=1 t n , V RT = 1 N N n=1 t n âˆ’ 1 N N n=1 t n 2 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where t n is the n th response time data point. Then, these values will be passed to the system of equations:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ Î¸ v = M CA, 1 âˆ’ I 1 (Îº) I 0 (Îº) = V CA, t 0 + a v I 1 (av) I 0 (av) = M RT, a 2 v 2 I 2 1 (av) I 2 0 (av) + 2a v 3 I 1 (av) I 0 (av) âˆ’ a 2 v 2 = V RT.</formula><p>Note that Îº = av. Now we try to solve this system of equations for the parameters of the CDM. The first equation gives directly the Î¸ v . We try to solve the second equation for Îº. First, It's more convenient and easier to work with a statistic called mean resultant length instead of circular variance. The mean resultant length (represented by R) is a concentration parameter that equals to one minus the circular variance (see section 2.3.1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mardia and Jupp (1999)</ref>). So the second equation becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">I 1 (Îº) I 0 (Îº) = 1 âˆ’ V CA = R.</formula><p>An approximate solution for this equation is given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banerjee et al. (2005)</ref> as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">Îº 0 = R(2 âˆ’ R 2 ) 1 âˆ’ R 2 .</formula><p>This approximation is not accurate enough for our purpose here, so we use the Newton-Raphson iteration as suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banerjee et al. (2005)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">Îº 1 = Îº 0 âˆ’ I1(Îº0) /I0(Îº0) âˆ’ R 1 âˆ’ I 2 1 (Îº0) /I 2 0 (Îº0) âˆ’ I1(Îº0) /Îº0I0(Îº0) .</formula><p>One iteration is satisfactory for our use here as the ratio of the estimate to the exact solution of the equation is between 0.995 and 1 + 10 âˆ’15 and we have checked that this magnitude of error has no considerable effect on the parameter recovery of the method. Now we rewrite the forth equation with respect to v, by replacing the a with Îº1 /v, and I1(av) /I0(av) with R:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">v 4 = 1 V RT Îº 2 1 R 2 + 2Îº 1 R âˆ’ Îº 2 1 ,</formula><p>which will give v, and a could be computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">a = Îº 1 /v.</formula><p>Then the t 0 can be calculated from the third equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">t 0 = M RT âˆ’ a v R.</formula><p>To summarize, the estimation starts with calculating statistics by Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_15">3</ref>and doing the following calculations in the given order:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ Î¸ v = M CA, R = 1 âˆ’ V CA, Îº 0 = R(2 âˆ’ R 2 ) 1 âˆ’ R 2 , Îº 1 = Îº 0 âˆ’ I1(Îº0) /I0(Îº0) âˆ’ R 1 âˆ’ I 2 1 (Îº0) /I 2 0 (Îº0) âˆ’ I1(Îº0) /Îº0I0(Îº0) , v = 4 1 V RT Îº 2 1 R 2 + 2Îº 1 R âˆ’ Îº 2 1 , a = Îº 1 /v, t 0 = M RT âˆ’ a v R.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>The tutorial for implementing the method is available in the link presented at the end of the article (Section 8).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Parameter Recovery</head><p>In this section, we will examine the performance of the proposed approach in recovering the parameters that generate data. To do so, we choose a range of parameter values, simulate data from them, estimate the parameters from that data, and look at the amount of difference between actual data generating parameter values and the estimated values. Because of the probabilistic nature of the model (different parameter values can generate the same data), this difference can not be zero. So, to have a reference for comparing the performance, the parameters are also recovered by maximum likelihood estimation which is expected to have almost the best possible accuracy in recovering parameter values.</p><p>A wide range for drift length and the threshold is considered that covers the previous estimates of the CDM on experimental data <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kvam, 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Smith et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Zhou et al., 2021)</ref> and also, contains the reasonable possible joint choice angle and response time distributions. Variation for drift angle is not considered as the changing of drift angle by âˆ†Î¸ v , will only rotate all choice data by this amount, which adding this quantity to Î¸ v in likelihood function (Equation (2)) will cancel the change, resulting in the MLE for all parameters will be the same except that the drift angle will be shifted by the amount of âˆ†Î¸ v . Also, this will happen for the EZ-CDM as only the value of M CA will change by âˆ†Î¸ v in Equation (3) which will only affect the calculation of the Î¸ v in Equation (4) which will shift it by the same amount of âˆ†Î¸ v . The same happens with the non-decision time. The change in data-generating non-decision time value will only shift all the response time data by this amount of change, and adding this to t 0 in likelihood (Equation (2)) will cancel the change. Also, this change will only affect mean response time M RT in Equation (3) which will only affect t 0 in Equation (4) which will shift it by the amount of change in generating non-decision time.</p><p>Here, 10,000 parameter sets are generated by taking samples from the uniform distribution in the range [.5, 4.5] for drift length and another sample independent from the previous, from that distribution for threshold. Based on what was said in the previous paragraph, the drift angle and non-decision time are taken to be zero. For each parameter set, two data sets with 100 and 1000 trials (representing the common and practically maximum number of trials in experiments) have been simulated. Simulation is done by running a random walk approximation of the stochastic process given in Equation (1):</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">âˆ†X 1 (t) = vâˆ†t + Î¾ 1 âˆš âˆ†t, âˆ†X 2 (t) = Î¾ 2 âˆš âˆ†t,</formula><p>where subscripts indicate coordinated components and Î¾ is a sample of standard normal distribution. We used âˆ†t = 0.001 seconds. The absence of the drift component in the second equation is because we take the drift vector to lie on the horizontal axis (drift angle equals zero), having zero component on the vertical coordinate. The random walk stops when it crosses the threshold circle and its angle and time (non-decision time is zero) from the simulated trial.</p><p>The EZ-CDM is easily fitted to each data set by the procedure given in the previous section. Maximum likelihood estimation is carried out using Equation (2) . One problem with this formula in MLE is that when the t âˆ’ t 0 becomes small, the term inside the exponential decreases slowly by increasing i which makes the summands converge to zero slowly. In this situation, for accurate calculation of the likelihood, the sum has to be calculated for many terms. This becomes severe for bigger values of threshold. Another problem is that when drift magnitude and the threshold become large, the first exponential increases which require the calculations in the formula to be done with higher precision. We calculated the sum to 200 terms and forced the resulting values to zero when they were calculated negative or when the last summand was nonzero in double precision form. Also, the calculations are carried out in double precision. We checked that in the range of parameters we use here, this is enough for dealing with the two problems described above (although problems start to be evident for a little bigger values of v and a). The Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm is used to find the maximum of the likelihood function (actually minimum of negative log-likelihood) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Nelder and Mead, 1965)</ref>. For each data set, the algorithm has run 20 times with random initial simplexes. Results show that in most of the cases the algorithm converges to the same optimal point (16 out of 20 on average) which shows the robustness of the optimization procedure. So we implemented the MLE with the almost highest precision.</p><p>The fit results are represented in plots alongside the quantitative report of the root mean squared error (RMSE). Mean squared error is an indication of the accuracy (actually, the technical term in statistical science is efficiency) in the performance of an estimator. This indicator incorporates both the bias of estimation (distance between the true value of the parameter and the average estimated value) and the variance (the spread of the estimated parameter value):</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">MSE = E (Î¸ âˆ’ Î¸) 2 = E (Î¸ âˆ’ E[Î¸] + E[Î¸] âˆ’ Î¸) 2 = E (Î¸ âˆ’ E[Î¸]) 2 + 2E Î¸ âˆ’ E[Î¸] (E[Î¸] âˆ’ Î¸) + (E[Î¸] âˆ’ Î¸) 2 = Var(Î¸) + Bias 2 (Î¸).</formula><p>In the above equation, Î¸ is the data generating parameter value, andÎ¸ is the estimated parameter value. Note that when there are varying generating parameters (drift length and threshold) the calculated MSE could be thought of as the average mean squared error over the whole range of generating parameter value. (see Chapter 20 in <ref type="bibr">Dekking et al. (2005)</ref> for introduction to efficiency and mean squared error). The square root of the mean squared error will be more illuminating, indicating the standard deviation of the estimated parameter values around the true data generating parameter value. So we will report the root mean squared error for parameter recoveries.</p><p>Simulations (generating random numbers) and calculating likelihoods are carried out using the NumPy 1.20.1 library <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Harris et al., 2020)</ref> and optimize.minimize in the SciPy 1.7.1 library <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Virtanen et al., 2020)</ref> is used for optimization. All calculations are implemented in Python 3.8.12 <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(vanRossum, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The results for parameter recovery of drift length for the MLE and EZ are plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. For the MLE, results show no considerable bias in the whole range. In particular, variability in recovery is lower when there are more data points. However, variability increases by an increase in generating value of v. On the other hand, the EZ is similar in performance as it has no evident bias and no great increase in variability compared to the MLE in the whole range of drift length and two possible data set sizes.</p><p>Besides, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref> contains recovery results for drift angle. The recovered values for drift angle by the MLE and EZ are the same (except for a negligible difference that is resulted from the optimization algorithm convergence criteria). This is because the only effect of drift angle is on choice angle data which we used the maximum likelihood estimation formula for deriving its parameters. Apparently, estimations seem unbiased and the variability is lower for larger datasets.</p><p>Moreover, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref> illustrates the recovery results for the threshold. The EZ performs similarly to the MLE, both showing no considerable bias and an increase in variability for higher values of generating threshold and for the smaller data set size.</p><p>The recovery results for non-decision time are given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref>. The MLE shows no bias and a lower variability for the bigger data set size. The same holds also for the EZ, but it has higher variability in recovery to some degree. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>: Parameter recovery results for drift length. Plots in the first row are for data sets of 100 trials and the second row is for 1000 trial data sets. Each point represents the recovered value against the data generating values of the parameter for a single data set. The first column shows the results for the maximum likelihood estimation method and the second column is for the EZ-CDM. The black line is the identity line y = x. The root mean squared error is represented in each plot.</p><p>From the other point of view, one other aspect of a reliable estimation method is that the estimation in one parameter is not affected by changes in other parameters (e.g. when two groups of subjects have only different drift lengths, the method detects the difference only in drift length and not other parameters). To give a better understanding of the performance of the proposed approach, this issue will be examined here in detail. As described earlier, the change in drift angle and non-decision time will only change the estimated values of the equivalent parameter. Now, we investigate the behavior of the EZ-CDM in recovering the parameters when the drift length and threshold change. For this, we plot the estimated values for other parameters for different values of drift and threshold. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 7</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> show the results when the drift length and threshold change. The plots show no evident bias in recovery which yields the desired property for the EZ-CDM. Additionally, variability in drift angle decreases with an increase in drift length and threshold. Also, variability in non-decision time decreases with an increase in drift length and a decrease in the threshold. These patterns are also present in maximum likelihood estimates. The increase in variability tells us that it will require more data to be able to detect differences in the parameter, but still, it is unlikely to incorrectly attribute changes in other parameters to a difference in this parameter as the recoveries show no bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Contaminant Responses</head><p>One problem that often arises when working with experimental data, is that the data is not completely the result of the process of interest in the study, and is contaminated to some degree by other effective processes. Meanwhile, in decision-making tasks, factors like fast guessing instead of trying to participate in the demanded trial or momentary lapse of attention can be considered as some of the contaminant data sources. Some of these contaminants can be detected and removed from data by cutoffs because their response pattern is disjoint from the main uncontaminated data. However, the problem arises when the contaminants are intermixed with the rest of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Ratcliff and Tuerlinckx, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The contaminated response time data could be a problem for the EZ-CDM if it has a severe effect     Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Ratcliff and Tuerlinckx (2002)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ratcliff (2008)</ref> on analyzing contaminants effect, we took the data sets in Section 4, and added a uniformly selected number from [0, 2] seconds to the response time for 5 percent of trials (5 trials in 100 trial data sets and 50 in 1000 trial data sets). The recovery of the EZ-CDM is compared to the recovery of the MLE for original uncontaminated data in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9a</ref>. Also,  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 9b</ref> shows the result for the more severe case of 10 percent contamination (10 trials in 100 trial data sets and 100 in 1000 trial data sets). Apparently, by looking at these figures, it can be seen that the EZ-CDM shows underestimation and increased variability for drift length recovery, especially for higher values of generating drift length. Furthermore, paying attention to these figures we observe that recovery of drift angle is identical for the MLE on uncontaminated data as the contamination only affected the response time, not choice angle data which the estimation of drift angle is based on. Besides, there is overestimation and increased variability in recovering threshold in the whole range. As the final look at the results obtained, we can see that the underestimation and increased variability are also evident in the recovery of non-decision time. All problematic patterns are more severely evident when the ratio of contaminant data increases from 5 percent to 10.</p><p>The origin of this poor performance can be traced to the sensitivity of the values of statistics in Equation (3) to contaminants. The additive nature of contamination in these data makes the mean and variance of response time larger and by looking at the formulas for estimation of EZ-CDM in Equation (4), this increased response time variance decreases the estimation of drift length by the fifth equation and this decreased estimated drift length, results in an increased estimated value of threshold by the sixth equation. These patterns decrease the estimation of non-decision time by the seventh equation, although this effect is alleviated by increased mean response time.</p><p>A more robust choice for statistics of central tendency and dispersion would be the median and interquartile range. Considering the response time distribution to be normal, it would be reasonable to take the median of data as an estimate for the mean of the distribution. Also, the interquartile range of data is expected to demonstrate the length between the first and third quartiles of a normal distribution which equals to iqr Ã— Ïƒ, where Ïƒ is the standard deviation of distribution and iqr is the interquartile range of the standard normal distribution (iqr â‰ˆ 1.349). So we can replace the statistics of response time data in  Equation (3) and Equation (4), i.e. M RT and V RT , with the following statistics:  where IQR is the interquartile range.</p><formula xml:id="formula_26">ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ median {t n } N n=1 , IQR {t n } N n=1 /iqr 2 ,<label>(5)</label></formula><p>First, we need to analyze the new method performance in parameter recovery of uncontaminated data (identical to Section 4). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows the recovery results of the robust EZ-CDM on datasets from Section 4. Generally, the robust EZ-CDM performed similarly to the MLE in variability except for increased variability in non-decision time and a little in drift length and threshold. The estimates for drift angle are the same for the two methods since we only changed the statistics for response time and not the choice angle in the robust version of the EZ-CDM. In terms of bias, the method overestimates the drift length  and underestimates the threshold. Meaning, that the exact value of the parameters will be estimated by an error but more importantly, the differences will still be detected with nearly the accuracy of the MLE as the bias is the same in the whole range. So the increased root mean squared error is expected to be because of bias and not much result of increased variance in estimation. Also, the sensitivity of the estimation of the robust EZ-CDM to changes in the drift length and threshold is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. Note that the varying drift angle and non-decision time will not be problematic as the change in the data-generating drift angle will only shift the estimated drift angle to the amount of the change, and changing the data-generating non-decision time will only shift the median of the response time and this will only shift the estimation of the non-decision time to the amount of the change in generating non-decision time. The results show that it is unlikely to wrongly attribute the change in one parameter to other parameters. Now, we investigate the performance of the robust EZ-CDM on recovering parameters for the same contaminated data. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> represents the results. The performance seems extraordinarily satisfactory. This good performance is the result of the robustness of the response time statistics to the contamination. The nature of the median and interquartile range is such that for a considerable change in them, a large proportion of data is required to be affected by contamination.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Experimental Data Containing Guess</head><p>Some important applications of circular experimental tasks are in situations where the paradigms are designed in a way that a considerable deal of data is the result of guessing alongside the main cognitive process <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Zhang and Luck, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Green and Pratte, 2022)</ref>. For example in the context of visual working memory, such guess data are claimed to be produced when the stimulus is not in the memory and this could give information about the capacity of the working memory. In such situations, it is critical to estimate the proportion of data coming from guessing. Actually, it would be beneficial if we could also estimate the CDM parameters of the main cognitive process besides the guess proportion. In the following, we try to give a method for doing this in detail.</p><p>A clear indication of guess data is that the choice is independent of the correct answer, so the distribution  of choices will be uniform over angles. This enables the capturing of the guess proportion by fitting a mixed distribution of uniform and a modal distribution (often considered von Mises distribution) over choices.</p><p>To use the CDM in this situation, it is necessary to identify the guess data and exclude them such that only the data relevant to the main decision process, take part in the CDM fitting. However, the problem is that guess trials are mixed with main trials, especially in region of high accuracy. In such situations, to separate two types of data, the model can be extended to include guess response time, but the challenge is that to the best of our knowledge there is no coherent and general model for guessing (till now) that includes response time. This means there is no indication of guessing in response time that we know of. So using the CDM in these situations needs a pre-assumption about the dynamic of guess data production. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Zhou et al. (2021)</ref> modeled guessing with the CDM that has zero drift. In another work, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Smith et al. (2020)</ref> modeled it with the CDM that has the same parameter values as the main process, which results in identical response time distributions for the guess and main decision process.</p><p>Here, at first, we give an example of using the EZ-CDM when we have an assumption about the guess response time, and then, we will give a method that requires no assumption about guess response time. For this purpose, we illustrate the use of the EZ-CDM on data from Smith et al. (2020) (the condition with high chromatic noise as it contains heavy-tailed choice angle data which is assumed to be the result of guessing) with this assumption that enables us to include all response time data to fit the EZ-CDM. The data is for a circular color task taken from 4 subjects (For more details about the experiment as well as the subjects, please see <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Smith et al. (2020)</ref>).</p><p>The assumption that the guess has the same response time distribution as the main decision process, results that the response time data having no information to separate guesses from main process data. So we look at only choices to separate guesses. As frequently used, we can fit a mixed model of uniform and von Mises on these data that will give the proportion of guess data and also the parameters for von Mises distribution. The mixed model can be fitted by the maximum likelihood estimation method. Worthy of being explained here, the likelihood of the mixed model is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_27">P r(Î¸) = p 2Ï€ + (1 âˆ’ p) e Îº cos(Î¸âˆ’Âµ) 2Ï€I 0 (Îº) ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where p is the probability of guessing. Here, the three parameters of p, Âµ, and Îº that maximize the likelihood of observed data, are found using the Nelder-Mead algorithm. The fits of the mixed model with these parameters are given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>. Also, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> contains the estimated parameter values of the mixed model. The fits are reasonable and parameter values are consistent with differences in the response pattern of subjects. The data for subject 3 shows a little heavier tails compared to other subjects and has a larger value of estimated guess proportion (p). There is not much evident angular bias in data for subjects and the low values of Âµ are consistent with this. Also, the data for subjects 3 and 4 seems more compact and concentrated than the other two subjects and the values of Îº agree with this pattern. Now that we have Âµ and Îº, we can put them in Equation (4) and do the calculations to get to values of v, a and t 0 by ignoring the first four equations in this system of equations. Note that similar to what we discussed here, it can be clearly seen that can use the robust version of the EZ-CDM. In both cases, we use statistics of all response time data.</p><p>The response time data and fit of the models are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>. The data contains some extremely big response times (not shown in plots). So we can expect that the simple EZ-CDM would fail to have appropriate fits, but the robust EZ-CDM and simple EZ-CDM on data after a cutoff of 4 seconds, produce more reasonable fits. Note that all will have identical fits on choice angle data, as they have equal The parameter values along with the negative log-likelihood (as an indicator of fit quality) are given in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref>: Histogram of response time data and fits of the model. The orange curve is the fit of the simple EZ-CDM, green is the fit of the robust EZ-CDM, and red is the fit of the simple EZ-CDM after data cutoff. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>: Parameter values of the CDM and negative log-likelihood (nll) for the 4 subjects. We assigned the minimum probability of 0.05 in calculating the likelihood of data points to decrease the effect of outliers in the reported values. As discussed previously, there is no reliable and general assumption about the guess response time. So, we give a method based on the EZ-CDM to estimate the parameters of the model without considering any assumption about the guess response time distribution family.</p><p>Let us suppose that the main cognitive process has a response time distribution (e.g. T 1 ) with a mean and variance of M RT 1 and V RT 1 , and also consider M RT 2 and V RT 2 as the mean and variance of guest response time distribution (e.g. T 2 ). If the two distributions are mixed with the probability of the guess being q, then the mean and variance of the mixed distribution T will be:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ E(T ) = tP (T = t) = t (1 âˆ’ q)P (T 1 = t) + qP (T 2 = t) = (1 âˆ’ q)M RT 1 + qM RT 2 , V (T ) = E[T 2 ] âˆ’ E[T ] 2 = t 2 P (T = t) âˆ’ E[T ] 2 = t 2 (1 âˆ’ q)P (T 1 = t) + qP (T 2 = t) âˆ’ E[T ] 2 = (1 âˆ’ q)(V RT 1 + M RT 2 1 ) + q(V RT 2 + M RT 2 2 ) âˆ’ [(1 âˆ’ q)M RT 1 + qM RT 2 ] 2 = (1 âˆ’ q)V RT 1 + qV RT 2 + q(1 âˆ’ q)(M RT 1 âˆ’ M RT 2 ) 2 .</formula><p>Now if we get the mean and variance of the mixed distribution in two regions of high and low accuracy, we could solve the resulting equations for the means and variances as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">ï£± ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£² ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£´ ï£³ M RT 1 = q (2) E (1) âˆ’ q (1) E (2) q (2) âˆ’ q (1) , M RT 2 = (1 âˆ’ q (2) )E (1) âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ q (1) )E (2) q (1) âˆ’ q (2) , V RT 1 = q (2) V (1) âˆ’ q (1) V (2) q (2) âˆ’ q (1) âˆ’ q (1) q (2) (M RT 1 âˆ’ M RT 2 ) 2 , V RT 2 = (1 âˆ’ q (2) )V (1) âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ q (1) )V (2) q (1) âˆ’ q (2) âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ q (1) )(1 âˆ’ q (2) )(M RT 1 âˆ’ M RT 2 ) 2 ,<label>(7)</label></formula><p>(superscripts are for two regions) and then, putting M RT 1 and V RT 1 in Equation (4) will give the parameters of the model. To do so, we split the experimental data into two regions of high and low accuracy that contain an equal number of trials (look at <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref>). This is done by finding the range centered at the circular mean that contains half of the data (the range length will be 2 times the median of absolute values of choice angle data minus drift angle). If this range is of length r, then knowing that the total guess proportion is p, this will result that the proportion of guess inside this range will be pr/Ï€ because the probability of guess in this region is pr/2Ï€ and the total probability of region is 1/2. A similar argument will demonstrate that the guess proportion in the low accuracy region will be p(2Ï€ âˆ’ r)/Ï€. Putting these two values as q in the above equations alongside the means and variances of response time data for each region will yield the mean and variance of the main decision process response time distribution (All calculations are provided in a tutorial. The link for this tutorial is available in Section 8). If we suppose that the guess has a response time distribution of the CDM family then we can find the CDM parameters for the guess by doing the calculation in Equation (4) for M RT 2 and V RT 2 and plot the resulting response time distribution of the mixed model. The results are given in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 16</ref>. Note that this is just for plotting purposes as we need to assume a distribution for guess to plot, but we did not use any assumption about guess response time for estimating the CDM parameters for the main decision process.</p><p>As a final point, note that we calculated the mean and variance of two high and low accuracy regions on response time data with a cutoff of 4 seconds to alleviate the effect of outliers. Also, we could use the robust statistics instead of the mean and variances in Equation (5) and then carry out the rest of the calculations on these values.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Discussion</head><p>We argued some of the benefits and the necessity for using the evidence accumulation models to provide a more accurate characterization of the underlying psychological process in continuous report paradigms. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref>: The response region is split into two categories of high and low accuracy. The region between two vertical black lines contains half of the data points considered as high accuracy. The distribution of response in each region is an intermix of guessing (in red) and the main decision process (in green). The reader may have also other reasons in mind. Many of these reasons are those that make researchers extensively use the evidence accumulation models on two alternative decisions. Despite this motivation, the works that applied these models to continuous report paradigms could be counted on the fingers of two hands. We think that a major reason for this could be the hardship of the implementation of these models which consists of fitting the model on the experimental data and estimating the interpretable parameters, as unlike models for two-choice experiments, reliable and easy to use methods and software packages for parameter estimation are not developed for continuous decision models so far.</p><p>To alleviate this hardship, here we proposed a simple procedure for estimating the parameters of the circular diffusion model and showed that besides being simple, it performs nearly like the MLE in terms of accurate estimating. The only exception was the non-decision time which the variability in the EZ-MLE estimates was higher than the MLE. So if the non-decision time is important for the research purpose and the estimates of the EZ-CDM do not give significant information, there is a possibility that using other methods of estimation be helpful. The results demonstrate that the EZ-CDM is also able to detect differences in conditions and groups. The parameter recovery results can be compared with the possible range of parameter values for individuals to get a rough estimate of the number of trials and subjects in experiments sufficient to test the proposed hypothesis.</p><p>The small deficiency of the EZ-CDM compared to the MLE can be from two sources. One is that the statistics we used for response time data, do not contain sufficient information about the whole dataset. The other source is that we fitted the choice angle data with the maximum likelihood, but the maximum likelihood method on both choice angle and response time data does not necessarily perform identically as maximum likelihood in only choice angle data. This means that the EZ-CDM fits the choice angle data a little better than the MLE but at expense of a little misfit in response time data, compared to the MLE.</p><p>One point worth mentioning is that in practice, the MLE is not suitable to use on experimental data as it is extremely sensitive to contaminant and outlier data. For this reason, other adjustments of the method are being used like using the MLE on partitions of the response space instead of single responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Ratcliff, 2018)</ref>, assigning a minimal value for the probability of data points that have a very small probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Smith et al., 2020)</ref> or using MLE on mixed models with contaminants <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Ratcliff and Tuerlinckx, 2002)</ref>. These methods are expected to have poorer performance than the MLE and they are the real rivals of the simple and robust version of the EZ-CDM, but we compared the simple EZ-CDM with the MLE and robust EZ-CDM on contaminated data with the MLE on uncontaminated data. We showed that the robust EZ-CDM is not much affected by a specific type of contaminant response time but looking at the nature of the statistics used in the method, the method is expected to be robust against other types of contamination. Also, there is no need to exclude extreme data points. But still, the presence of some kind of contaminants in choice angle data could be problematic for the EZ-CDM. Some robust methods for estimating von Mises distribution parameters have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kato and Eguchi, 2016)</ref> that can be replaced with the maximum likelihood method used in the first part of the EZ-CDM in case of need.</p><p>We also proposed a method for fitting the mixed model of the CDM and guess. The method needs no assumption about the guess response time and the estimates of the parameters are expected to converge to the data generating values of parameters with enough data, no matter what the guess distribution is. A pitfall in the method is that it does not use the coupling information of the choice angle and response time in an ideal manner. This coupling is important and contains the necessary information for separating guesses from main decision process data, but the method only uses the coupling associated with two regions of choice angle (high and low accuracy) and not the coupling of single data points. There is a possibility for enhancing the method to use the coupling at the level of single data points.</p><p>A common way of extending the evidence accumulation models is adding trial-to-trial variability to the parameters of the model. For the case of CDM, this variability is considered for all 4 parameters in previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Smith et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Zhou et al., 2021)</ref>, some resulting in better fits and some making not much improve in fits on particular data. The EZ-CDM in its current form does not consider these variabilities. Generally adding these variabilities will increase the fit quality but at the same time, increase the complexity of the model. Previous works on the diffusion decision model of two-choice tasks show that the simpler model without considering variability on parameters, could perform better in detecting the differences in parameter values than the complex model that considers the variability, even when the true data generating model is the complex one <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(van Ravenzwaaij and Oberauer, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2017)</ref>. However, we did not analyze this here for the CDM and it may be considered in future works.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a simple method for estimating the parameters of the circular diffusion model. The method consists of calculating some statistics of data (circular mean and variance of choice angle, and mean and variance of response time) by Equation (3) and then using these values in formulas to estimate the parameters by Equation (4). Also, a robust version of the method was introduced which uses statistics in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_26">5</ref>that are less affected by contaminants. We tried to build trust in these methods by comparing the recoveries in a vast range of parameter values with the maximum likelihood method. The results were favorable.</p><p>We also gave a method for estimating the mixed model of CDM and guess which needs no assumption on the guess response time distribution. The method consists of fitting the mixed model on choice angle data by maximizing the likelihood function in Equation (6) which will yield the parameters of choice angle distribution, and then, separating the response time data by the accuracy of choice angle and using Equation (7) to get statistics of the response time data for the main decision process. Putting these in Equation (4) will give the desired parameter values.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The CDM model in one trial of a circular decision task.
