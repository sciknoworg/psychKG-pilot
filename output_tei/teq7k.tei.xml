<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="50">Years of Anchoring: A Meta-Analysis and Meta-Study of Anchoring Effects</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Each day, people estimate how long it will take to get to work, calculate how much to offer for a used car, guess how many others might be traveling to the airport, or consider the magnitude of various quantities. But, how do people decide how much they might be willing to pay for a bottle of whiskey, or what the wait time might be for entry into a concert venue, or how fast the newest Bugatti model might be? On what do people base their estimates? Contrary to a normative decision-making process in which individuals assign specific weights to informational inputs, carefully search their memory for all relevant information and potential numbers, and disregard incidental numbers, hundreds of studies suggest people in fact will incorporate clearly uninformative numbers when making numeric estimates.</p><p>The anchoring effect -the observed assimilation of judgments toward numbers present in the environment -has been a quintessential, highly studied example of bias in human judgments for half a century (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>. The prevalence of research on the anchoring effect is due to its ubiquity in a vast array of judgment domains.</p><p>Past examples include general-knowledge questions <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Jacowitz &amp; Kahneman, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Turner &amp; Schley, 2016)</ref>, real-estate appraisers evaluating home prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Northcraft &amp; Neale, 1987)</ref>, prices for consumer products <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ariely, Loewenstein, &amp; Prelec, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Green, Jacowitz, Kahneman, &amp; McFadden, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Simonson &amp; Drolet, 2004)</ref>, first-offers in negotiations <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Galinsky &amp; Mussweiler, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Loschelder, Stuppi, &amp; Trötschel, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Mason, Lee, Wiley, &amp; Ames, 2013)</ref>, risk perceptions and probability judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Chapman &amp; Johnson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Plous, 1989)</ref>, advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Rader, Soll, &amp; Larrick, 2015)</ref>, and even legal judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Englich, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Glöckner &amp; Englich, 2015)</ref>. As is evidenced by the myriad of domains where the anchoring effect has been studied, its impact has extended far beyond its origins in psychology, into economics, marketing, management, law, medicine, among many more.</p><p>Despite the ubiquity of anchoring phenomena across a wide array of domains, there is no consensus about what the relevant moderators and boundary conditions are alongside numerous non-overlapping theories occupying the literature. In the current manuscript we aim to provide some organization to this important and expansive literature. In pursuit of this goal, the current investigation synthesizes predictions from the seven existing theories, offers a framework for categorizing existing mechanisms and moderators, meta-analyzes existing effect sizes, conducts a meta-study to evaluate conclusions from the meta-analysis, and offers directions for future research in this domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Paradigms of the Anchoring Effect</head><p>The original anchoring paradigm, which we refer to as "paradigm one", asked participants to judge whether a target quantity was greater or less than a random number.</p><p>In the canonical demonstration, experimenters presented participants with a spinning wheel that was rigged to land on the number 65 or 10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>.</p><p>Depending on the outcome of the pseudo-random process, participants were asked to answer whether the percent of African nations in the United Nations was greater than or less than 65% or 10%. Subsequently, participants provided a numerical estimate about the percentage of African nations in the United Nations. Results indicated an "anchoring effect," such that participants' median judgment was 45% when presented the 65%-anchor and 25% when presented the 10%-anchor.</p><p>One subset of the literature moved away from having participants explicitly evaluate the anchor and studied whether incidentally presented numbers would similarly influence estimates. We refer to this paradigm as "paradigm two". These numbers were entirely divorced from the target judgment. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Wilson, Houston, Etling, and Brekke (1996)</ref> presented participants with numeric strings (i.e., the anchors), in a presumably unrelated task, before participants completed a numeric judgment. Related, <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Critcher and Gilovich (2008)</ref> had participants estimate the menu prices at a restaurant named "Studio 17" versus a restaurant named "Studio 97'. In both cases, the only thread linking the anchors to the target judgment was temporal proximity (i.e., the numbers were presented moments before the focal judgment.</p><p>Other subsets of the literature instead examined cases for which the anchor has contextually diagnostic information (i.e., the anchor is normatively diagnostic for that decision context). We refer to this paradigm as "paradigm three". For example <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">, Englich and Mussweiler (2001)</ref> found that judges' sentencing decisions were longer when prosecutors made longer sentencing requests (i.e., the anchor). Importantly, prosecutors do not select their sentencing requests at random. Quite to the contrary, these requests are typically informed by the case. Thus, using diagnostic information should be seen as normative. 1 Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Northcraft and Neale (1987)</ref> found that real-estate agents estimates of home prices were higher when homes had higher listing prices (i.e., the anchor) than when they had lower listing prices. Again, sellers have diagnostic information relevant to the decision (e.g., conditions of the housing market, interest rates, similar recent sales) and imbue their listing prices with that normatively useful information.</p><p>Despite paradigms two and three being quite different from the canonical example from paradigm one, authors self-identify these as anchoring effects because the studies contained two elements common to paradigm one: 1) a numeric stimulus that appears before the judgment and 2) a pattern by which participants' judgments assimilated in the direction of these numeric stimuli. This very broad inclusion criteria is both what makes this literature highly impactful and generalizable but also conceptually complex.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Brief Review of Existing Theories</head><p>The anchoring effect has accumulated at least seven different theories proposing underlying mechanisms that drive anchoring effects. 2 While there are a number of theoretical accounts that could be applied to anchoring (e.g., E. J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Johnson, Häubl, &amp; Keinan, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Schwarz, 1994)</ref>, we focus on those that self-identify as distinct theories of anchoring effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anchoring-and-Adjustment.</head><p>The core proposition of the original Anchoring-and-Adjustment theory is that when attending to an anchor stimulus, decision-makers begin with that anchor and adjust away from that value <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>. For example, in the context of judging percentage of African countries in the United Nations, people start at the 10% anchor then iteratively adjust the estimate upward, stopping periodically (e.g., at 20%) to evaluate whether that interim value is within the realm of plausible values.</p><p>The adjustment process ends via one of two mechanisms. The first mechanism supposes that adjustment is effortful, and decision-makers run out of their willingness to exert effort before adjusting all the way back to the true value <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2001</ref>. For example, a decision-maker may adjust up to 20% then reconsider whether this value is an appropriate guess about the percentage of African nations in the U.N. If the estimate is still too low, they repeat this process. Because this process is effortful, decision-makers may stop this adjustment prematurely ending at an estimate that is assimilated in the direction of the anchor stimulus.</p><p>The second mechanism asserts that decision-makers have some knowledge about the true value for the judgment and this knowledge is implied by a range of plausible values <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Quattrone, Lawrence, Finkel, &amp; Andrus, 1984)</ref>. When anchors are outside of that plausible range, decision-makers adjust until they reach the boundaries of that plausible range. Because the decision-maker stops at the first value within this range, that first value is more likely to be closer to the starting anchor stimulus than to the middle of the range.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Numeric Priming.</head><p>Numeric Priming <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Critcher &amp; Gilovich, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Reitsma-van Rooijen &amp; Daamen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Wilson et al., 1996)</ref> contends that any stimulus activated in the environment can be encoded into short-term memory, and the activation of that stimulus can influence in subsequent judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Fazio, Sanbonmatsu, Powell, &amp; Kardes, 1986)</ref>. As such, numbers encountered in the decision environment, whether they are directly attended to via a comparison or indirectly as background features of the environment, become accessible in short-term memory and are then conflated when evaluating a target stimulus. In short, the anchor stimulus has a disproportionate salience in memory and thus contaminates the focal judgment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selective Accessibility Hypothesis.</head><p>The Selective Accessibility Hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Chapman &amp; Johnson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Mussweiler &amp; Strack, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997)</ref> suggests that when presented an anchoring question (e.g., "Is the Mississippi River greater than or less than 1,500 miles"), the decision-maker engages in a confirmatory hypothesis test about the possibility that the anchor is equal to the true value. When engaging in any confirmatory search, decision-makers selectively search for information that is consistent with the query <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Klayman &amp; Ha, 1987)</ref>. Because this anchor-consistent knowledge is now in short-term memory due to this confirmatory search, that anchor-consistent knowledge biases judgments in the direction of the anchor value. 3</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attitudinal Perspective.</head><p>The Attitudinal Perspective applies the tenets of the elaboration likelihood model <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986)</ref> to the anchoring effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Wegener, Petty, Blankenship, &amp; Detweiler-Bedell, 2010)</ref>. This theory contends that decision-makers can engage with anchors via a more deliberative central-route process whereby they engage in a process somewhat analogous to the Selective Accessibility Hypothesis (i.e., confirmatory reasoning about why the anchor is related to the true value). Alternatively, decision-makers can process anchors via a less-deliberative, peripheral-route process in which the stimulus acts as a prime analogous to the process described in the Numeric Priming account.</p><p>Additionally, this is the only account that explicitly argues that anchors can serve as diagnostic cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(Schwarz, 1994)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scale Distortion Theory of Anchoring.</head><p>Rather than anchors changing decision-makers' perception of a focal stimulus, the Scale Distortion account suggests that anchors affect the internal scale decision-makers use to map their knowledge onto a numeric response (S. W. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Frederick &amp; Mochon, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b129">Mochon &amp; Frederick, 2013)</ref>. When making any numeric judgments, decision-makers have mapping knowledge (e.g., knowing that the Mississippi River is shorter than the width of the U.S. but longer than the height of the U.S.) and metric knowledge (e.g., knowing the major rivers tend to be longer than 1,000 miles, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Brown &amp; Siegler, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b183">Smith &amp; Windschitl, 2015)</ref>. That is, decision-makers can retrieve exemplars from memory that provide information about the ordinal position of a target stimulus relative to other comparable exemplars in memory (i.e., mapping knowledge) and exemplars that provide information about the cardinal quantity of that target stimulus (i.e., metric knowledge).</p><p>Scale Distortion argues that anchoring occurs not via mapping (e.g., a low anchor about the length of the Mississippi River should not make decision-makers think of the river as shorter relative to other rivers) but via a shift in the metric knowledge (i.e., a low anchor changes what numbers decision-makers will use to express the length of rivers in miles).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extremeness Aversion.</head><p>According to Extremeness Aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Lewis, Gaertig, &amp; Simmons, 2019)</ref>, like in Anchoring-and-Adjustment, decision-makers begin at a presented anchor value and adjust away from the anchor. The authors propose an additional stopping mechanism to the two specified above: decision-makers stop adjusting when they feel that their adjustment from the anchor is too extreme (i.e., far away from the anchor).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Noise Theory.</head><p>The Noise Theory is centrally focused on the plausible range of values decision-makers evaluate when responding to an anchor (C.-Y. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Lee &amp; Morewedge, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The amount of noise in a decision-maker's representation maps onto how wide that range is. For a given anchor, any increase in noise in the representation will increase the anchoring effect. For example, higher magnitudes have greater noise, which translates into larger anchoring effects. Further, those with higher knowledge have less noisy representations, which reduces anchoring effects.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Interim Review: The Distribution of Phenomena and Theories</head><p>The above sections highlight several important qualities about this diverse literature. The first is in terms of the phenomenon itself. The anchoring literature appears to amalgamate a wide array of distinct phenomena under the umbrella of "anchoring" despite the fact that the psychological processes involved in incidental primes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Critcher &amp; Gilovich, 2008)</ref> almost completely differ from the processes involved in more deliberative decision contexts (e.g., judges decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Englich &amp; Mussweiler, 2001)</ref>. For the sake of this review, we incorporate this very wide and conceptually blurring categorization of anchoring, but we discourage readers from assuming that the different types of paradigms necessarily have common psychological antecedents.</p><p>The second insight pertains to our brief review of the theoretical landscape. The persistence of such a wide array of theories is likely because the theorists implicitly or explicitly recognized the above point -that there are different fundamental processes underlying different types of anchoring phenomena. And as such, different theories emerged to accommodate fundamentally different phenomena.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theory-Based and Exploratory Moderators</head><p>The above section suggests that different paradigms and contexts were used to study different theories. For example, studies testing the anchoring-and-adjustment perspective involved largely different moderators than studies testing numeric priming (e.g., incentives versus mood). As such, the collection of moderators across the whole literature appears disjointed. In this section we attempt to offer a framework for categorizing the different design features across this wide literature. While some moderators within the literature pertain to specific cognitive processes (e.g., selective retrieval of anchor-consistent knowledge from memory) others moderators are not rooted in theoretical processes but are intended to be phenomenological (e.g., robustness of anchoring to the presence of incentives). Note, in our earlier discussion of the three general paradigms of anchoring we argued that similar patterns of behavior might reflect distinct processes. Because the goal of the meta-analysis is to integrate past literature, we treat paradigms two and three as moderators (i.e., primed/incidental anchors and contextualized diagnostic anchors, respectively) below rather than as separate meta-analyses and discuss their partitioning further in the General Discussion. Furthermore, paradigms two and three both include the same inclusion criteria for both the independent and dependent variables.</p><p>We categorize the different mechanisms from existing theories into four general sets of features that broadly integrate the existing theories: Salience, Inference Making, Memory Retrieval, and Depth of Information Processing. Note, Salience and Depth of Information Processing are not processes in of themselves, but act to change the amount (e.g., extent of elaboration) or type of (e.g., may increase/decrease the relative attention to the anchor stimulus compared to other features in the decision environment) information being processed. An overview of these four components, which moderators pertain to each, and which theories make predictions of which moderators is provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Salience</head><p>One common feature of existing theories is the role of perceptual salience of the anchor in the judgment. 4 For example, Numeric Priming <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">(Wilson et al., 1996)</ref> and the Attitudinal Perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Wegener et al., 2010)</ref> suppose that attending, albeit incidentally, </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">↓ NA/↓ ↓ NA Delay 0 0/↓ Inference Comparison Used ↑ Different Stimulus/Dimensions ↓ ↓ Transparently Random Anchors 0 0 Contextualized Diagnostic ↑ Directional ↓ ↓ Precision ↑ Debiasing ↓ Memory Extremity ↑/0 ↑/0 ∩ ↑ ↑ Knowledge ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ Self-Generated Depth of Information Processing Incentives ↓ ↓ ↑ Cognitive Load ↑ ↑/↓ 0 ↑ Mood ↑ Note.</formula><p>↓ Indicates that the theory explicitly predicts a decrease in the magnitude of the anchoring effect in the presence of the moderator. ↑ indicates the theory predicts an increase in the anchoring effect. "0" indicates that the theory predicts explicitly that the moderator will not influence the magnitude of the anchoring effect. "NA" indicates that the theory predicts that an anchoring effect should not emerge under the conditions of that moderator (i.e., effect size = 0). ∩ indicates an inverse U-shaped relationship between moderator and size of the anchoring effect. If there are more than one symbol in a cell, this implies that different articles within that literature make conflicting predictions.</p><p>to anchors results in the anchor being active in working memory at the moment of the focal judgment. Anchoring-and-Adjustment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Quattrone et al., 1984)</ref> and Extremeness Aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Lewis et al., 2019)</ref> require attention to the anchor value for adjustment to begin.</p><p>That is, the adjustment process is effortful, so it requires deliberate attention to the anchor as a starting point. And, the Selective Accessibility Hypothesis (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997)</ref> requires the anchor to be attended to for there to be a confirmatory-hypothesis-testing process. Thus, the existing theories provide some consensus that anchoring effects must operate, in part, via attentional processes and features that alter attention (or the amount of information derived when attended to) should influence anchoring effects. One key difference between theories is in how much attention is required, and as such, moderators that influence the salience of the anchoring stimulus offer differential predictions. In the section below, we discuss relevant moderators.</p><p>Primed/Incidental Anchors. Incidental/Primed anchors (i.e., paradigm two) are anchors with no explicit relationship to the target judgment. For example, whether a restaurant is named Studio 17 or Studio 97 should not be diagnostic of its meal price.</p><p>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Wilson et al. (1996)</ref> presented participants with numeric strings, in a presumably unrelated task, before participants completed a numeric judgment. The Numeric Priming account supposes that increased exposure increases anchoring from these incidental anchors <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">(Wilson et al., 1996)</ref>. 5 While the authors of the Attitudinal Perspective do not specify it, we will assume that anchoring effects occurring via the central route (i.e., standard anchors) will on average be larger than anchoring effects via the peripheral route (i.e., basic anchoring/incidental anchors) because persuasion is, on average, stronger via the central route than via the peripheral route <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986)</ref>. However, Scale Distortion argues that incidental anchors should not influence responses because they do not change the response scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b129">(Mochon &amp; Frederick, 2013)</ref>. Similarly, the mechanisms for Anchoring-and-Adjustment are incompatible with incidental anchors as people need explicit anchors from which to adjust.</p><p>Temporal Delay. A temporal delay between the anchor and focal judgment may reduce the accessibility of an anchor in memory and thus its salience <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Estes, 1955;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Kahana, 2012)</ref>. This delay may be achieved through minor changes such as a page break separating the presentation of the anchor stimulus and the target judgment to longer delays over the course of multiple days (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Blankenship, Wegener, Petty, Detweiler-Bedell, &amp; Macy, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Mussweiler, 2001)</ref>. Selective Accessibility contends anchoring will endure this delay due to self-generation of knowledge underlying anchoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Mussweiler, 2001)</ref>. Similarly, the Attitudinal Perspective argues anchoring has an even more persistent effect when occurring without (vs. with) cognitive load due to greater potential processing depth <ref type="bibr">(Blankenship et 5</ref> The Selective Accessibility Hypothesis assumes a confirmatory hypothesis test which implies some deliberation on the the anchor <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Mussweiler &amp; Strack, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997)</ref>. At the same time, one of the original authors has also published evidence of subliminal priming of anchors  which they argued was in line with the Selective Accessibility Hypothesis. We are unable to reconcile the explicit deliberation of the confirmatory-hypothesis-testing mechanism with the type of information processing involved in subliminal priming studies. As such, we have accounted for this apparent inconsistency in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> with "NA" (i.e., no anchoring) to reflect the predictions implied by <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Strack and Mussweiler (1997)</ref> and ↓ to reflect the predictions from <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Mussweiler and Englich (2005)</ref>.</p><p>al., 2008), though both cases exhibited anchoring effects after a week.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inference Making</head><p>Decision-makers must process not only the focal stimulus, but the implied context by which a stimulus is presented. A canonical example of this is the attribute framing effect, where beef described as 75% lean leads to different favorability judgments than when it is described as 25% fat <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Levin &amp; Gaeth, 1988)</ref>. The difference in judgments is produced not by the focal number (i.e., 75 vs. 25) but instead by the inferences the decision-maker can derive from the context <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Hilton, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Schwarz, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b176">Sher &amp; McKenzie, 2006)</ref>. The Attitudinal Perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Wegener et al., 2010)</ref> explicitly discusses the role of anchors being interpreted as inferential cues for the judgment. But, other accounts imply some inferential processes whereby decision-makers learn something from the anchor value. For example, in the Scale Distortion Theory, anchors inform decision-makers about how to map their knowledge from their own internal scale to a numeric response. And in the Selective Accessibility Hypothesis, the anchor provides information about where decision-makers should engage in a hypothesis test. This role of inference-making is also implicit in past anchoring researchers' attempts to create transparently random anchors <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ariely et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">S. Frederick, Mochon, &amp; Savary, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>: the need for transparently random anchors is intended to minimize the likelihood that decision-makers are, or should be, actively learning from the anchor. The moderators in this section can be thought to influence the perceived informativeness of the anchor such that the context of the anchor signals whether decision-makers should or should not use the anchor value <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Grice, 1975)</ref>.</p><p>Comparison Question. Despite the original experimental setup attempting to present an uninformative anchor(e.g., spinning wheel of fortune <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>, some have argued that conversational norms are still inferred by decision makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Grice, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Schwarz, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b203">Wegener et al., 2010)</ref>. Directing attention to a random number and having participants compare that number to the target judgment (e.g., is</p><p>[TARGET] greater than or less than [ANCHOR]?) might signal that the number is in fact meaningful. If not conversational inferences directly, others have argued that these comparison questions can differentially activate information consistent with the anchor's value <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Chapman &amp; Johnson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997)</ref>. That is, people may elaborate on an anchor as a function of considering the comparison question, which makes the anchor salient according to Numeric Priming. What is common to these points is a potential impact of explicitly asking participants to engage in this comparison question before making the focal numeric judgment. 6 Different Stimulus/Dimensions Diagnositicity. This moderator changes whether the anchor concerns the target judgment or an irrelevant/different judgment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Harris &amp; Speekenbrink, 2016)</ref>. In the simplest case, the anchor is about the width of Brandenburg gate while the judgment is about the height of the gate <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">(Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997)</ref>. Here the anchor and the target concern the same item (i.e., the gate), are on the same dimension (i.e., meters), but different attributes of the item (i.e., height vs. width).</p><p>A slightly more pronounced version of this is where the target item changes. For example, the anchor is about the time it takes to bake chicken and the target judgment is about the time it takes to bake brownies. Here, the only common element is the dimension (i.e., minutes). Another case is when the dimension changes. For example, participants were presented an anchor as a percent of account balance to pay, but made judgments about the amount to pay off in dollars instead of a percentage <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Harris &amp; Speekenbrink, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Selective Accessibility argues any of these stimulus/dimension mismatches reduce the magnitude of anchoring because anchor-consistent knowledge is less relevant to other <ref type="bibr">6</ref> Notice that the only theory with a prediction in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> is Numeric Priming. This is because while Selective Accessibility and the Attitudinal Theory both discuss how attention to the comparison question facilitate anchoring, they do not make explicit comparisons between conditions with and without the comparison question. Conversely, <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Wilson et al. (1996)</ref>'s Numeric Priming account makes explicit predictions in Study 2 whereby conditions without the comparison question operate via the Numeric-Priming mechanism and exhibit a small anchoring effect, and the condition with the explicit comparison question operates via activation similar to selective accessibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Chapman &amp; Johnson, 1999)</ref> and produces larger anchoring effects.</p><p>targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">(Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997)</ref>, and Scale Distortion similarly suggests, due to scaling effects, anchors only influence responses when the anchor and target are on the same dimension (S. W. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Frederick &amp; Mochon, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Transparently Random Anchors. As mentioned above, a number of studies have implemented cues to deter decision-makers from inferring that there is implicit diagnostic information <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ariely et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">S. Frederick et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974</ref>). For example, some studies explicitly tell participants the anchors are random <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">(Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997)</ref>. Others visually demonstrate randomness (e.g., rigged wheel of fortune such that participants would observe a seemingly random number being generated by the wheel, <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>. Anchoring-and-Adjustment was first found using transparently-random anchors. Selective Accessibility argues that, even if anchors are transparently random, as long as they are on a relevant dimension, people will engage in confirmatory hypothesis testing that leads to anchoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">(Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Contextualized Diagnostic Anchors. While anchors were initially conceptualized as transparently uninformative (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>, within paradigm three some operationalizations are necessarily imbued with decision-relevant information that decision-makers might pick up on. For example, it is logical for real-estate agents and prospective buyers to infer a home's value from the list price of the house (i.e., sellers do not set list prices at random <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Northcraft &amp; Neale, 1987)</ref>. The Attitudinal Perspective would argue anchors from more reliable sources should produce stronger anchoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Wegener et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Directional Anchors. Directional anchors provide explicit instructions about which direction decision-makers must adjust to arrive at a numeric estimate <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">(Simmons, LeBoeuf, &amp; Nelson, 2010)</ref>, and as such reduce uncertainty around how to use the anchor, increasing its informativeness. 7 For example, telling participants that the number of African nations in the United Nations is greater than 10% could provide more information than asking them whether the correct answer is above or below 10% because the direction implies a communicative signal from the experimenter to participant -this could be seen as a manifestation of demand effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Orne, 1962)</ref>. According to Anchoring-and-Adjustment, and by proxy Extremeness Aversion, directional anchors should decrease anchoring because they lower uncertainty about the correct direction of adjustment. This reduction enable adjustment in one direction that would feel less extreme and less effortful with respect to ascertaining how far to go since participants no longer need to do decide in what direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Lewis et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Simmons et al., 2010)</ref>. However, there are also higher-order interactions with directionality that are beyond the scope of this meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2005</ref>.</p><p>Precise Anchors. Anchors can occur with varying levels of precision such as the number of significant digits or with rounded or non-rounded values (e.g., 3500 miles vs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Janiszewski &amp; Uy, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Jerez-Fernandez, Angulo, &amp; Oppenheimer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Loschelder et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Mason et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Zhang &amp; Schwarz, 2013)</ref>. This effect has been argued through two separate mechanisms: scale granularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Janiszewski &amp; Uy, 2008)</ref> and conversational inferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Jerez-Fernandez et al., 2014)</ref>. According to the scale granularity account, because adjustment is effortful <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2001</ref>, if decision-makers adjust away from the anchor by X steps, precise anchors make the decision-maker's internal scale more granular, resulting in each adjustment step being smaller than in the case when the anchor is round. Thus, for a given X steps, the precise anchor will result in less total adjustment. The conversational inference explanation argues that anchors carry implied diagnostic information with them <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Cialdini, Kallgren, &amp; Reno, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Grice, 1975)</ref>.</p></div>

Considerable effort has been made toward debiasing anchoring, though there is mixed evidence as to whether debiasing can fully attenuate (or even directionally reduce) the anchoring effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr">Y.-H. Lee et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Simonson &amp; Drolet, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Zhao, 2012)</ref>. While there are different iterations of debiasing interventions in the literature, in general, many of these debiasing approaches encourage the decision-maker to consider alternative inferences for the judgment. In principle, a debiasing manipulation that, for example, warns participants about the anchoring effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">(Wilson et al., 1996)</ref> or encourages them to consider alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Mussweiler, Strack, &amp; Pfeiffer, 2000)</ref> imply to the decision-maker something about how the anchor should be interpreted (i.e., changing the decision-maker's inferences about the anchor).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision-Maker's Memory</head><p>A decision-maker's memory is either explicitly or implicitly relevant to anchoring for most existing theories. For example, in Anchoring-and-Adjustment, decision-makers start at the anchor and iteratively adjust away until they reach the boundary of their range of plausible values <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Quattrone et al., 1984)</ref>. These plausible values are likely exemplars stored in memory. The Selective Accessibility Hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">(Mussweiler &amp; Strack, 2000b</ref>) is predicated on the retrieval of anchor-consistent exemplars from memory. The Noise Theory (C.-Y. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Lee &amp; Morewedge, 2022)</ref> assumes that decision-makers have noisy representations of judgments in memory and the anchoring effect is driven by the amount of noise. The moderators in this section can be thought to influence the amount and type of information retrieved from memory when making judgments in the presence of anchors.</p><p>Anchor Extremity. Anchor extremity implies that, for a given level of anchor-relevant knowledge, anchor values further from the median belief will, on average, be perceived to be more extreme. For example, an anchor about the Chicago Bears scoring greater than or less than 85 points during the entire 2007 regular football season might seem reasonable to a non-football fan but might feel extremely low to an avid football fan with more judgment-relevant exemplars in memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">(Smith, Windschitl, &amp; Bruchmann, 2013)</ref>. We categorize this under memory because the perception of extremity is derived by the decision-maker evaluating the anchor against values in their memory. If the anchor value is outside a plausible range (i.e., perceived to be too extreme), then it may be discounted for failing to match existing memory representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Quattrone et al., 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b205">Wegener, Petty, Detweiler-Bedell, &amp; Jarvis, 2001)</ref>. Extant theories mostly have predictions for this moderator. Anchoring-and-adjustment argues that more extreme anchors may increase anchoring as long as the anchors are within the decision-maker's range of plausible values. Once anchors are outside that range, people will adjust estimates back into the range <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Quattrone et al., 1984)</ref>. The Attitudinal Perspective, by contrast, suggests extreme anchors will be discounted and will produce weaker effects, yielding an inverse-U shape by which anchoring is less effective when the low and high anchors are extreme relative to not <ref type="bibr" target="#b205">(Wegener et al., 2001)</ref>. Extremeness Aversion contends people will cease adjustment when they feel they have moved too far, which leads to larger effect sizes as anchor extremity increases. Finally, according to he Noise Theory, higher magnitudes, which may be achieved at more extreme values, should widen the range of plausible values and thus increase anchoring.</p><p>Knowledge. Experts may have their own heuristics, schema, and background information <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alba &amp; Hutchinson, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Payne, Bettman, &amp; Johnson, 1993)</ref>, which may inform either the use of the correct answer <ref type="bibr">(Wilson et al., 1996, Numeric Priming)</ref> or what values are considered within the range of possible values (Anchoring-and-Adjustment and Selective Accessibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Mussweiler &amp; Strack, 2000a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Quattrone et al., 1984)</ref>. Even if they do not know the exact answer, experts (relative to non-experts) might have a tighter (i.e., less noisy) distribution of plausible values (C.-Y. <ref type="bibr">Lee &amp; Morewedge, 2022, Noise Theory)</ref> or might use irrelevant anchor information less because they have a sufficient amount of information already to make the judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">(Smith et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Turner &amp; Schley, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Self-Generated Anchors. In the early 2000s, <ref type="bibr">Gilovich (2001, 2006)</ref> argued that self-generated anchors were fundamentally different from experimenter-provided anchors. In these setups, participants may adjust to a final estimate from an internal anchor retrieved from their own memory. For example, when judging when George Washington became president of the United States, individuals may start from 1776, the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and then determine how many years later Washington was elected. 8</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Depth of Information Processing.</head><p>The moderators in this section can be thought to influence the amount and type of information processing. The Numeric Priming account presumes anchoring effects occur via relatively effortless processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">(Reitsma-van Rooijen &amp; Daamen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Wilson et al., 1996)</ref>, whereas Anchoring-and-Adjustment require an iterative (i.e., elaborative/effortful) decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2001</ref>. The Attitudinal Perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Wegener et al., 2010)</ref> explicitly separates out anchoring via more and else deliberative processes.</p><p>Together, this implies that anchoring involves different processes (or that the consequences of a given process are different) under different levels of elaboration on the anchoring task.</p><p>Incentives. The impact of incentives is a popular moderator, particularly in the economics literature due to its substantive implications <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Camerer &amp; Hogarth, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Hertwig &amp; Ortmann, 2001)</ref>, as there is variability in the extent to which decision-makers are motivated to provide "accurate" judgments. Researchers have applied explicit monetary incentives to motivate accurate judgments -with mixed evidence regarding whether monetary incentives reduce anchoring effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Wright &amp; Anderson, 1989)</ref>. However, in principle, incentives may motivate effortful adjustment and decrease anchoring according to Anchoring-and-Adjustment. According to Numeric 8 Subsequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Simmons et al. (2010)</ref> argued that the idiosyncrasies of self-generated anchors were not due to them being self-generated, but rather due to the fact that such anchors were directional (e.g., knowing the true answer for George Washington question was later than the signing of the Declaration of Independence).</p><p>Priming, incentives should decrease the anchoring effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b207">(Wilson et al., 1996)</ref>. The Attitudinal Perspective makes the opposite prediction because it conceives as anchors as persuasive messages and attitudes/beliefs formed via more central (i.e., elaborative) processes are stronger than those via more peripheral processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Wegener et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Cognitive Load. While anchoring has been demonstrated in cases where decision-makers could allocate only minimal attention to the numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">(Reitsma-van Rooijen &amp; Daamen, 2006)</ref>, with some recent exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Röseler et al., 2021)</ref>, it nevertheless necessitates some processing resources on behalf of the decision-maker. We amalgamate two conceptually related moderators: cognitive load (e.g., keeping a string of letters in working memory while completing the task) and time pressure under the label "cognitive load" as both types of tasks reduce the extent to which decision-makers can utilize more deliberative processes. Anchoring-and-adjustment contends load should decrease effortful adjustment and thus increase anchoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2006)</ref>. The Numeric Priming account argues cognitive load could increase anchoring if it diminishes consideration of alternative inputs and not the anchor itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">(Reitsma-van Rooijen &amp; Daamen, 2006)</ref>. The Selective Accessibility Hypothesis suggests this boundary might change response times but not influence anchoring as long as confirmatory hypothesis-testing occurs <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Englich, Mussweiler, &amp; Strack, 2005)</ref>. Finally, the Noise Theory posits that cognitive load increases noise and thus anchoring (C.-Y. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Lee &amp; Morewedge, 2022</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mood.</head><p>In some anchoring paradigms, researchers manipulate participants' mood.</p><p>There are conflicting predictions. For example, Anchoring-and-Adjustment suggests that the greater processing depth induced by negative moods increases motivation to adjust from the anchor, decreasing the anchoring effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Inbar &amp; Gilovich, 2011)</ref>. Conversely, the Selective Accessibility Hypothesis suggests that sad moods induce greater processing depth <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bodenhausen, Sheppard, &amp; Kramer, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Englich &amp; Soder, 2009)</ref>, and this greater processing increases the accessibility of anchor-consistent knowledge in working memory, producing larger anchoring effects.</p></div>

However, we did not include judgments beyond the first one made when there was one anchor for multiple judgments about the same target (e.g., the value, initial offer, and willingness-to-pay in <ref type="bibr">Wu, Cheng, &amp; Lin, 2008, Study 1)</ref>.</p><p>When studies included exactly three different anchor levels (e.g., low, medium, and high) aside from a no-anchor control, we excluded all "medium" anchor conditions, opting to include only the lowest and highest anchor conditions (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bartels, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Dogerlioglu-Demir &amp; Koçaş, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Dowd &amp; Artistico, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">M. H. Jung et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Ma, Li, Shen, &amp; Qiu, 2015)</ref>. These "medium" anchor conditions occurred rarely. However, in cases with multiple levels of low/medium/high (e.g., extremely low, low, high, and extremely high), we created comparisons between low and high, and between extremely low and extremely high. For example, in O'Conor, Johannesson, and Johansson (1999), we paired starting bids $100 and $100,000, $1,000 and $50,000, $5,000 and $20,000, and $10,000 and $15,000. Because of the above inclusion criteria, cases with, for instance, a high and very high anchor, but no low or no-anchor conditions, were excluded (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Mussweiler &amp; Strack, 2000b, Study 4)</ref>.</p><p>We used effect sizes from either the question level or from an index across questions.</p><p>Notably, several anchoring studies contain multiple anchoring questions that are occasionally averaged into a standardized index before analysis. When possible, we tried to acquire the results at the question-level <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">(Smith et al., 2013)</ref>; however, in other cases we had to use the index due to data availability (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Wegener et al., 2001, Study 1a)</ref>. We also excluded any studies that presented coefficients from a regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b147">(Nunes &amp; Boatwright, 2004</ref>) as these coefficients would not translate for effective comparison to the other effect sizes in the meta-analytic database.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Outlier Exclusions</head><p>After the literature search, open call, and requests to authors, and filtering via out inclusion criteria, we had 1306 effect sizes in our meta-analytic database. There were several empirical strategies for outliers. The primary approach we report in the main text excludes observations with a Cook's distance greater than (4/n − 2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Cook, 1977)</ref>. This resulted in the exclusion of 23 effect sizes, constituting 1.76% of observations in our focal database. This left 1,283 effect sizes. Further, concurrent with running data analyses, the authors also verified that the effect sizes from the top five and bottom five percentiles had been correctly calculated. In Online Appendix B, we also provide analyses (1) without exclusions, (2) excluding the bottom and top 2.5% of effect sizes, and (3) excluding effect-sizes from the large replication papers (Collaboration, 2015; R. <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Klein et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> R.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Additional Databases</head><p>The early demonstrations of anchoring involved comparing judgments in the presence of high versus low anchors. But over the years, researchers have broadened their investigations to several other experimental setups. In the main text we will present our meta-analysis of the common high-versus-low anchoring effects. In the Online Appendices, we provide three additional meta-analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High/Low versus control.</head><p>The most obvious extension are cases whereby the high and/or low anchor judgment is compared to a no-anchor control condition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Cervone &amp; Peake, 1986)</ref>. We decided against amalgamating these high/low versus control effect sizes with the high versus low effect sizes because it is not necessarily the case that the control condition represents the midpoint between the high and low anchors in the primary database. As such, we believe it to be more prudent to separate the high/low-versus-control database from the primary high-versus-low database. We note that studies that had high, low, and control conditions were included in both meta-analyses. Given our Cook's distance criterion, we excluded 24 (4.5%) of the 537 effect sizes, leaving 513 effect sizes in 107 studies in this database.</p><p>Estimates of the average effect size and related analyses can be found Online Appendix C;</p><p>Moderator analyses can be found in Online Appendix F.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Correlations between anchors and judgments.</head><p>We also separately analyzed studies that used a range of anchors (e.g., the last two digits of a social security number or phone number) and correlated that distribution of anchors with the distribution of judgments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ariely et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Simonson &amp; Drolet, 2004)</ref>. While it is possible to collapse such study designs into a high versus low dichotomy (e.g., around 50 if from 0-100, <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Simonson &amp; Drolet, 2004)</ref>, that would require assumptions about the distribution of anchors, and more importantly, the distributions of responses. We calculated effect sizes in r when analyzing these continuous-anchor database, with Fisher's z adjustment, as this metric best represented the data (i.e., the relationship between anchor value and estimate value). This database had seven observation excluded (3.0%) based on Cook's distance (leaving 228 effect sizes in 40 studies). Estimates of the average effect size and related analyses can be found Online Appendix D; Moderator analyses can be found in Online Appendix G.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anchor-estimate gaps.</head><p>Finally, we also coded studies that used anchor-estimate gaps in which there was an explicit, experimenter-provided, or implied, anchor against which an estimate could be compared <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Inbar &amp; Gilovich, 2011)</ref>. Studies using the anchor-estimate gap measured the dispersion of judgments around the anchor rather than the influence of the anchor on mean judgments. We coded studies that either intended to study the anchor-estimate gap or provided individual-level comparisons of the subjects' estimates against the implied or provided anchor. While it is possible to subtract the anchor from the condition mean and label the resulting value as an anchor-estimate gap for studies that did not do this, that process makes untenable assumptions about the distribution of responses. Within those studies that used anchor-estimate gaps, 380 provided the raw deviations between the anchor and participants estimates and 204 provided standardized deviations. It is not straightforward to compare raw absolute deviations to standardized values because raw values, by definition, will have no values less than 0 whereas approximately half of standardized values will be less than 0. As such, we had to separate these effects into two separate databases and provide analyses for each individually. Given our Cook's distance criterion, we excluded 5 (1.3%) of the 380 effect sizes (leaving 375 in 44 studies) for the raw-anchor-estimate-gap database and none of the 204 effect sizes in 15 studies in the standardized-anchor-estimate-gap database. Because there is no baseline value for anchor-estimate gaps (i.e., they are used in the literature predominantly to evaluate anchoring moderators), we do not conduct an analysis of an average effect size for these databases but report moderator analyses in Online Appendix H.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coding</head><p>The papers were divided among four coders, two of whom were the authors. At the time of coding, the coders ranged from a masters student to an associate professor. The authors worked with the other two coders to develop the coding sheet. The coders first began with a set of 9 training studies and feedback was provided directly after. Then, to establish reliability (see Online Appendix A for details) coders evaluated 16 studies with 53 observations (median κ = 0.662); a few variables with insufficient agreement were dropped.</p><p>The two authors had a median agreement of 1. In September 2021, the two authors reviewed all coding done and resolved any and all discrepancies, and coded six additional moderators in Spring 2024. Reliability for new moderators was established on 48 observations and reached sufficient levels (median κ = .803). The research team coded two types of moderators: theory-based moderators and exploratory moderators. The procedure for each coding, and the corresponding dummy variables are organized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, which also includes the counts for each variable level as superscripts. Priming/Basic Anchoring Whether or not studies used basic anchoring, in which a number is primed subliminally (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">Reitsma-van Rooijen &amp; Daamen, 2006)</ref> or superliminally (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Brewer &amp; Chapman, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Critcher &amp; Gilovich, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b207">Wilson et al., 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Not Priming/ Basic Anchor 1146</p><p>Priming or Basic Anchoring 137</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison Question Used 970</head><p>No Comparison Question 313</p><p>Different Dimensions Whether or not the anchor came from an irrelevant dimension or source to the current (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997, Study 1)</ref> or was from a different scale (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Harris &amp; Speekenbrink, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Wong &amp; Kwong, 2000)</ref>. Note, our coding in the meta-analysis included all incidental anchors as different dimensions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Critcher &amp; Gilovich, 2008)</ref> because by definition the anchor concerns a different stimulus than the target judgment. However, to ensure we could separate these cases from incidental anchors, prior to analysis we recoded cases of priming=1 to have values of 0 for different stimulus/dimension coding.</p></div>

For example, in paradigm one, participants evaluate if some target (e.g., the Mississippi river) is longer or shorter than an anchor before the numerical estimate of interest (i.e., the Mississippi river's length), which means participants can adjust upwards or downwards from the anchor. However, in many self-generated anchors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2005)</ref> and some experimenter-provided anchors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b177">Simmons et al., 2010)</ref>, there is a clear direction (i.e., upwards or downwards) to adjust.

This included observations whereby the original authors defined the anchor as "extreme" or "implausible", or when there were other anchor levels that were more moderate.

To account for correlations among data as studies sometimes contained either multiple observations per person (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Smith &amp; Windschitl, 2011)</ref> or multiple conditions orthogonal to anchoring (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Blankenship et al., 2008)</ref>, data were analyzed using a three-level nested random effects models in which effect sizes were nested within study <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Cheung, 2014)</ref>. 9</p><p>Note, a standard random-effect meta-regression is considered two level because the variance is decomposed into variance within and variance between effect sizes. Further nesting the variance between-effect sizes within study (e.g., a given study used had multiple anchoring tasks) then adds a third layer. This is slightly different from the convention of "levels" in multilevel modeling with standard regression. Details with other model specifications (e.g., fixed effects, random effects without nesting, nesting with effect sizes at which errors are clustered at the study level) are available in Online Appendix B but yielded similar results.</p><p>We analyzed moderators using all univariate models, multivariate models controlling for all other theoretical and exploratory moderators, and univariate models among studies that contained variation on a moderator 10 . We also conducted moderator analyses controlling for publication bias methods (described below) and performed multiple other robustness checks under different model nesting structures (see Online Appendix E).</p><p>9 Dependence between any given effect size can be due to either/both 1) common-method bias from authors of the individual studies and/or 2) correlation induced by our sampling as the meta-analyst. For common-method bias, consider a given research team has a systematic bias in their methods/data collection. That bias will show up as a correlation between all of the effect sizes produced by that team. For meta-analytic sampling bias, if effect sizes are disproportionately sampled from papers that use a limited set of anchoring experimental settings (e.g., anchoring studies about the Mississippi River), the common study feature (i.e., Mississippi River) can produce correlation in the observed effect sizes. The three-level meta-analytic model aims to partition out these other types of study-level heterogeneity from the effect-size-level heterogeneity of interest.</p><p>10 These models are technically bivariate because they include an intercept and a single slope coefficient. We refer to them as univariate out of convention within the meta-analytic literature unpublished studies from reaching out to listservs and authors of the 200 we e-mailed who were asked for unpublished work. In total, we had 233 documents (180 in the high vs. low dataset).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overall Effect Size</head><p>After our inclusion criteria and aforementioned outlier deletions, the literature search for high versus low anchors ultimately resulted in papers with studies and effect sizes (median number of effect sizes per study: 2). Overall, we observed a robust effect of anchoring when comparing high against low anchors (d = 0.824, 95% CI[0.765, 0.883], z = 27.428, p = &lt; .001; Q = 19277.896, p = &lt; .001); 55.03% of the total variation was between studies (τ 2 3 = 0.276) while 38.61% was within (τ 2 2 = 0.194) indicating that our three-level model accounted for approximately 93.64% of the variation in effect sizes.</p><p>We found similar or larger results when analyzing the data with a fixed effects model without weighting or nesting, a fixed effects model with weighting of the average effect size (but still without nesting), or a two-level random effects model (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table 3</ref>). This table includes the overall effect size, 95% confidence intervals, and associated heterogeneity statistics (I 2 ) for each of these models.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publication bias.</head><p>We employed numerous methods to address publication bias concerns that might emerge from such sources as selective reporting (i.e., only significant studies become published) and small-study effects (i.e., studies with smaller samples have larger effect sizes than those studies with larger samples) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Coburn &amp; Vevea, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Harrer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Peters, Sutton, Jones, Abrams, &amp; Rushton, 2008)</ref>. For the sake of parsimony, we provide a coarse description of our methods here in the main text, with additional details in subsequent footnotes and in Online Appendix B. First, as stated above, we solicited unpublished data to directly compare effect sizes in published data to those in unpublished data <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bediou et al., 2018)</ref>. The key assumption is that the effect sizes from unpublished data (16.4% of the database) are approximately representative of the pertinent study features of the published data. To test this, we added a single moderator based on whether a given effect size came from a published study (coded as 0) or an unpublished study (coded as 1). Results If the true effect size is non-zero, then studies with large sample sizes should deviate from the true effect relatively little and both those with smaller and larger effect sizes are likely to be published (i.e., because there is sufficient statistical power to have a significant p-value with a small effect size). But, studies with small samples have an asymmetry.</p><p>Those with smaller (vs. larger) effect sizes likely do not have the statistical power to have a significant p-value and thus will be unlikely to be published. We test for this asymmetry by plotting the distribution of effect sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Begg &amp; Mazumdar, 1994)</ref> on the x-axis against the standard error on the y-axis, where smaller standard error (i.e., larger sample sizes) values are higher on the axis. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> presents this contour-enhanced funnel plot, where the contours indicate areas where a given study's effect size and standard error should be nonsignificant, marginally significant, p &lt; .05, or p &lt; .01 <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Palmer, Sutton, Peters, &amp; Moreno, 2008</ref>). Next we evaluated asymmetries in the distribution of effect sizes using the <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Begg and Mazumdar (1994)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Palmer et al., 2008)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary: Overall Effect Size.</head><p>The above analyses highlight several important points. The first is that anchoring effect is large and robust, regardless of model specification (see 3. There is some evidence of publication bias, such that the effect sizes reduces by as much as half depending on which assumptions of publication bias we make (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). This large overall effect is present across literatures, and even in unpublished datasets (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Table 4</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Moderator Analyses</head><p>A key with the numeric coding of each moderator is provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> to facilitate interpretation of subsequent results. All dummy variables are coded 0 for the level of the moderator that was most prevalent in the literature. For example, most studies (i.e.,1146 effect sizes) do not use priming whereas a relatively smaller subset do (i.e., 137 effect sizes).</p><p>This way, all multivariate analyses can be interpreted with regard to the "average" empirical result in the literature. Overviews of the moderator analyses are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Tables 5 and 6</ref>. For the sake of parsimony we present a limited set of results here. Detailed analyses and results, as well an exploration of publication bias in moderator results can be found in Online Appendix E. and univariate models (second two columns). The left-most column presents our primary 3-level random effect model with effect size nested within study. We applied an additional step in our moderator analyses. Standard error calculations are based on assumptions of the dependence structure between effect sizes. This is often unknown and heterogeneity in that dependence structure can greatly increase Type-1 or Type-2 errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b194">(Tipton, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Recent developments encourage the use of robust variance estimation for calculating standard errors on meta-analytic coefficients <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Pustejovsky &amp; Tipton, 2022)</ref>. This is particularly important when considering moderators whose effect sizes are idiosyncratically nested within different subsets of the literature. All theoretically relevant moderator dummy variables were included simultaneously in this model so that the effect of a given moderator can be assessed controlling for the influence of other moderators. <ref type="bibr">13</ref> The next column includes all of the theoretical moderators plus the exploratory moderators as controls. The last two columns are univariate analyses in which effect size is regressed on each moderator individually. In the first of the two univariate columns, each model estimates the effect of the moderator using the full 1,283 effect sizes. Many studies only include a single level of a given moderator. As such, in the last column we subset the data to those studies which included both levels of a given moderator (i.e., the moderator was experimentally manipulated within that study) -sample sizes for those subsets are included in <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 6</ref>. 14 In <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 6</ref>, we calculated the results of the univariate models in the two righthand columns of <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref> in terms of their effect size for each level of the dummy variables. For each univariate model we took the intercept to reflect the anchoring effect when that <ref type="bibr">13</ref> In our primary meta analysis here, there were no observations with self-generated anchors, as such it will not be included in the subsequent analyses. These effects are primarily studied in paradigms using the anchor-estimate gaps (see Online Appendix H) moderator is coded 0 and the coefficient on the moderator term to be the change in the effect size for a one-unit change in the moderator. For example, because moderators were coded as 0 and 1, the coefficients in <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 6</ref> can be interpreted as the change in Hedges' g between the levels of that moderator. Note the intercepts in these models are all different and not directly interpretable in the case of the multivariate models. The first column the primary three-level model with effect size nested in study which is nested within paper. The second column is controls for the exploratory moderators. The following column presents results for a series of univariate models with the three-level random effect nesting structure. Each univariate analysis has only a single moderator as the predictor in that model, meaning that each model has its own intercept. The last column repeats the univariate models, but rather than utilizing the total database in each model, it instead subsets the data to only include studies that had both levels of a given moderator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Salience.</head><p>Priming/Basic Anchoring. Results indicated substantially smaller effect sizes for primed/basic anchors compared to the majority of anchoring studies with coefficients ranging between -0.72 and -0.89 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 6</ref> presents the results of the univariate models from   <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">(Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997)</ref> or implies some diagnostic cue to the participant <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">(Schwarz, 1994)</ref>, the literature has prioritized the use of these comparison questions as the delivery system for anchors in 73.7% of our database. Understanding the moderating impact of this comparison question is difficult because this variable correlates with several other variables. Both multivariate models indicate a sizeable reduction in the effect size when the anchor is presented as transparently random (β's -0.27 and -0.31). Surprisingly, both the univariate models did not indicate moderation. We would caution from interpreting the univariate model in column 4 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref>. Despite transparently random anchors being used in 22.2% of our primary database, we only found 8 effect sizes in total where this highly prevalent feature of the anchoring literature was manipulated within a study.</p><p>Contextually Diagnostic Anchors. We found no reliable difference for contextually diagnostic anchors (β's -0.16 to 0.28). Similar to the previous case, we would discourage interpretation of the results of the univariate subset analysis because we only had 4 effect sizes where the anchor was manipulated to be more diagnostic. The rest of the results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref> suggest that contextually diagnostic anchors produce smaller anchoring effects than anchors rendered non-diagnostic through transparent randomness or different dimensions. This appears contradictory to the above results in this inference-making section -where reducing the relevance of the anchor by having it on a different dimension as the target or making it transparently random reduces the anchor, making it more relevant by it being in a diagnostic context should increase the size of the anchoring effect. This result can be interpreted in one of two ways. Either there exists some inverse U-shaped relationship with inference making, or there exists some potential omitted variable bias related to paradigm three such that there are other features of studies (i.e., the other contextualizing information in the study design separate from the anchor value) that reduce the effect size that are not included in this meta-analysis. when anchors are precise than when they are round (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Janiszewski &amp; Uy, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Mason et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Zhang &amp; Schwarz, 2013)</ref>, meta-analytic evidence suggests only weak and inconsistent when the anchor is precise compared to round. The wide confidence intervals on these estimates reflects the relatively few observations of anchor precision in the database -there are considerably more in the anchor-estimate-gap database reported in Online Appendix H.</p><p>Debiasing. Meta-analytic results indicate consistent decreases in the magnitude of the anchoring effect for studies where a debiasing manipulation was applied (β's -0.37 to -0.17). This is consistent with a range of judgment and decision-making biases that are reduced by debiasing strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Morewedge et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Memory.</head><p>Extreme Anchors. Results consistently revealed little evidence (β's -0.02 to 0.09) of extreme anchors influencing the effect size. This null result could be interpreted in two ways: that the extremity of the anchor does not impact the psychological processes involved in anchoring, or our coding of extremity -which is based on authors' implied or explicit labeling of the anchors as extreme in their text -does not sufficiently capture the latent construct of extremity.</p><p>Knowledge. Meta-analytic results indicate a small and relatively consistent decreases in the magnitude of the anchoring effect for cases where participants were more knowledgeable about the target judgment (β's -0.21 to -0.14). Note from <ref type="table" target="#tab_16">Table 6 that</ref> while anchoring effects are smaller for those who are more knowledgeable (e.g., experts in a target judgment domain), the coefficients are still quite large and reliable among knowledgeable decision-makers implying that anchoring still persists among both non-experts and experts -though to varying degrees.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Depth of Information Processing.</head><p>Incentives. Meta-analytic results indicate consistent decreases in the magnitude of the anchoring effect for studies where an incentive was applied to decision-maker's accuracy (β's -0.24 to -0.23).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive-Load.</head><p>We observe little evidence (β's -0.06 to -0.02) of cognitive-load on the magnitude of the anchoring effect. Results were consistent for this moderator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mood.</head><p>Results were relatively consistent across models (β's -0.35 to -0.15), though estimates had relatively wide confidence intervals due to the few observations of this particular moderator. Note, we code all negative emotions within this moderator, so the weak evidence of an attenuation should not be interpreted with regard to any other emotion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Publication Bias in Moderator Analyses</head><p>Publication bias has been explored in estimates of aggregate effect sizes (for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">McShane, Böckenholt, &amp; Hansen, 2016)</ref>, but limited attention has been paid to corrections of estimates of moderators(for an initial overview, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Coburn &amp; Vevea, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>This makes sense given that most meta-analyses are not large enough to engage in a thorough exploration of the moderator space. In contrast, our meta-analysis provides a sufficient quantity of observations and diversity of moderators to engage in an analysis of publication bias of each moderator. We adapted existing selection-model techniques to all of the models presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_13">Table 5</ref>, but using only a 2-level versions of the models as higher-level models are not equipped to handle these publication-bias tools. We then applied two versions of single-step <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(McShane et al., 2016)</ref>, and four versions of multi-step <ref type="bibr" target="#b202">(Vevea &amp; Woods, 2005</ref>) selection models to account for publication bias. Overall, the results for publication-bias corrections were largely consistent with the uncorrected parameters -suggesting that our above results are unlikely the consequence of selective reporting based on p-value. Full methodological detail and results are outlined in Online Appendix E.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Summary: Moderator Analyses.</head><p>As stated above, we avoid the dichotomization of null hypothesis testing and rather focus on a quantitative assessment of relative effect sizes. Results of salience-related moderators suggest that in general there is some evidence that decreased attention to the anchoring stimulus -either because the stimulus was presented as a prime/incidentally or via a time delay between presentation of the anchor and the judgment -likely reduces the magnitude of the anchoring effect. Notably, primed/incidental anchors are the only moderator that potentially eliminates the anchoring effect. Said another way, priming anchors, if they produce anchoring effect, result in negligible or very small impacts on judgments. Across the different inference-making-related moderators, results are mostly consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Schwarz (1994)</ref>: anchors might have conversational cues to decision-makers who interpret the anchors as diagnostic to the focal judgment. Reducing the diagnosticity of these cues was associated with reduced effect sizes. While we did not observe any consistent evidence of anchor extremity on the magnitude of the anchoring effect, we caution that this may be due to the limited ability to code for extremity across the papers because the majority of papers do not provide calibration information to interpret the extent of extremity. Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">Smith et al. (2013)</ref>, decision-makers who were more knowledgeable about the target judgment exhibited smaller anchoring effects. For information-processing-related moderators, we find that only incentives reliably reduce the anchoring effect, but acknowledge some systematic reductions for negative-emotion studies that warrant further investigation. More extensive moderator analyses and publication bias details can be found in Online Appendix E. Moderator analyses for the other meta-analytic databases can be found in Online Appendices F-H.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Meta-Study</head><p>To supplement our review and synthesis of the anchoring literature, we also conducted a meta-study (for reviews on meta-studies see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Baribault et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">DeKay, Rubinchik, Li, &amp; De Boeck, 2022)</ref>. While meta-analysis is a powerful tool for efficiently summarizing the literature, 1) it is correlational in nature, 2) it can lack orthogonality and comparability across effect sizes, and 3) it faces concerns with publication bias.</p><p>Meta-studies offer an environment for testing orthogonal moderators, and a pre-registered meta-study eliminates the concern of publication bias.</p><p>Anchoring provides a strong opportunity to test moderation of the effect of interest.</p><p>Meta-studies begin with a core design around the effect of interest. In this case, our core design will be the manipulation of high versus low anchors for a set of general knowledge questions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Jacowitz &amp; Kahneman, 1995)</ref>. We then manipulate each of these moderators across this core design. These moderators are embedded as a micro-study within a singular large orthogonal structure. Moderators are included as within-or between-participant factors in the meta-study design. The procedure, participants, experimental design and primary statistical analyses were pre-registered and can be found at (AsPredicted #141242) https://aspredicted.org/Y51_336. All meta-study materials, data, analyses, as well as additional robustness checks are provided in Online Appendix I on the manuscript's OSF page:</p><p>https://osf.io/9yduf?view_only=2f433256dd404a5ca83d703c1e1b4d99).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants.</head><p>We recruited 2001 U.S. adults from Prolific in August 2023 in exchange for ($1.60) and randomly assigned them to condition (see Method section below for experimental design). We excluded 33 responses who failed any one of three pre-registered attention checks. The final sample included 1,968 US adults (M age = 40.71 years, IQR = 20, 825 female, 1098 male, 37 non-binary/third gender, and 8 preferred not to specify).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure.</head><p>Participants completed eight anchoring questions in a random order (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">Table 7</ref>).</p><p>In the meta-study, for each of the eight items, participants first saw a numeric anchor, then saw an image containing the anchoring item's text for their numeric estimate. This image was intended to reduce the probability that participants searched for the answer online by copying and pasting the question text. Then, lastly, participants indicated their subjective knowledge from 1 (not at all knowledgeable) to 7 (extremely knowledgeable) on a subsequent page. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Design</head><p>We included as many moderators as possible based on which moderators could operate independently of each other. Meta-studies are predicated on an assumption that the effects of any given moderator are independent of other moderators in the study design <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baribault et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">DeKay et al., 2022)</ref>. This assumption limits the potential anchoring moderators that could be included. We incorporated moderators within-or between-participant if they were unlikely to violate independence across the other conditions of the meta-study. For instance, it would be difficult to manipulate anchor stimulus and directionality orthogonal to whether the anchor is a primed anchor or not.</p><p>That is, while some moderators could easily be applied to standard anchoring tasks, it is not straightforward how to apply these moderators across numeric primes.</p><p>Within-subjects we manipulated whether anchors were more precise (i.e., had a .00 at the end of the number or not), and anchor extremity (whether the participants saw the 3rd/97th, 15th/85th, or 30th/70th percentiles). That is, across the eight different anchoring questions, participants could see more or less extreme, high or low, and more or less precise anchors. We also measured subjective knowledge for each question.</p><p>Between-subjects we manipulated the presence of cognitive load (i.e., whether or not a load task requesting retention of a letter string was present), debiasing instructions (i.e., whether or not participants were told at the start of the study and before each judgment to avoid anchoring), incentives (i.e., whether or not participants learned they could receive a $0.50 bonus for being within the 10% closest on a randomly-selected judgment), delay (i.e., whether or not there was a page break between the numeric anchor and estimate), directional anchors (i.e., whether the anchor was in a comparative question to which the participants responded, or stated the target value was greater or less than the anchor), and diagnosticity in terms of different target stimulus (e.g., asking the anchor in the context of brownie-baking or chicken-cooking prior to a numeric estimate about brownie-baking). Full details of the experimental design, including how each moderator was operationalized, can be found in Online Appendix I.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Meta-Study Analysis and Results</head><p>In line with our pre-registration, for each anchoring question we winsorized the data at the 95th percentile (i.e., the bottom and top 2.5% of responses). 15 Responses for each anchor item were z-scored within item to equate different scales across judgments (e.g., numbers of calories will have responses much greater than number of U2 studio albums released), such that the mean of each anchoring question in <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">Table 7</ref> is 0 with a standard deviation of 1. All binary moderator variables were dummy coded then mean-centered, such that the intercept reflects the average level of the two conditions. Anchor extremity was coded with a linear-effects coding such that the less extreme anchors (i.e., 30th and 70th percentiles) were coded -0.5, the moderate anchors (i.e., 15th and 85th percentiles) were coded 0, and extreme anchors (i.e., 3rd and 97th percentiles) were coded 0.5. Additionally, we included a quadratic coding for extremity as well (i.e., -0.66, 0.33). Knowledge was treated as a continuous variable but median split only for graphical purposes.</p><p>Because conditions of the meta-study are manipulated orthogonally to the anchor item, we can take the z-scored responses (scaled within anchor item) and compute the average scaled estimate for the low and high anchor conditions for each condition of the meta-study design. In <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, we present the mean estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the low anchors -the points lower than 0 -and high anchors -the points higher than 0. The dashed lines represent the average estimates for the low and high anchors across all moderators of the meta-study. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scaled Estimates</head><p>Note. The horizontal dashed lines represent the average estimates in the low and high anchor conditions. All values below 0 correspond to the low-anchoring condition and those above 0 are the high-anchoring condition. For each moderator, we provide the mean and 95% confidence intervals for low and high anchors in that particular condition. Thus, moderation of the anchoring effect would be reflected by the gap between the low and high anchors becoming greater or smaller between levels of the moderator.</p><p>In line with our pre-registered analysis plan, participants' responses were submitted to a mixed-effect linear regression. We begin with the following base model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Y ij = α i + β 1j • Anchor + k β k x k α i = γ 00 + u 0i β 1j = γ 10 + u 1j<label>(1)</label></formula><p>In Equation 1, α is the average response for all participants i and micro-study j;</p><p>where microstudy is simply an index of which cell of the between-participant factors that observation corresponds to (for details on this type of specification, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">DeKay et al., 2022)</ref>. We allow for random intercepts u 0i for participants. Additionally, we estimate a random slope u 1j on the anchoring-effect parameter to allow for variation in the anchoring effect across microstudies. 16 Anchor-item-level variability is accounted for in the x k term.</p><p>The x k term includes 7 anchor-item dummies to account for variability due to the particular anchoring questions in <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">Table 7</ref>, the 10 coefficients for the 9 moderators (anchor extremity has a linear-coded predictor and a quadratic coded predictor -hence why there is one extra coefficient), and 10 interaction terms between the moderator variables and the  Note.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Below we discuss the consistencies and inconsistencies between the meta-study results and those of the meta-analysis.</p><p>Results consistent with the meta-analytic results. Overall, we observed six consistent findings between the two approaches on delay, different dimensions, directional anchors, precision, debiasing, and knowledge. We provide this categorization for efficiency but caution treating the results as definitively consistent or inconsistent. For example, while delay had a negative coefficient in the meta-analysis and a positive coefficient in the meta-study, both estimates included zero in their confidence intervals. Further, we recognize that although the meta-analysis examined knowledge in terms of objective knowledge differences, the meta-study employed subjective knowledge. Though these two may diverge <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alba &amp; Hutchinson, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Carlson, Vincent, Hardesty, &amp; Bearden, 2009)</ref>, their relationship with the magnitude of anchoring was consistent in this context.</p><p>Results inconsistent with the meta-analytic results. Overall, we observed three clearly inconsistent findings between the two approaches (i.e., extremity, incentives, and cognitive load). Whereas the meta-analysis indicated little moderation by extremity, results of the meta-study indicated a large increase in the anchoring effect when the anchors were more extreme. One important consideration is that the coding of extremity in the meta-analysis was based on the authors' explicit or implicit characterization of extremity.</p><p>Most studies in our meta-analysis had no explicitly-declared calibration pretest to evaluate the extent of an anchor's extremity for their sample population. Further, even within the meta-study, our characterization of the 3rd and 97th percentiles might not reflect the same magnitude of extremity as those used in the studies within the meta-analysis. Next, unlike the meta-analysis, in the meta-study we did not observe incentives attenuate the anchoring effect. It is possible that the presence of incentives gave no new strategies for addressing anchoring but instead only increased motivation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Arkes, 1991)</ref>. Finally, cognitive load may have increased effect sizes in the meta-study but not the meta-analysis because of mono-operation bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Shadish, Cook, &amp; Campbell, 2002)</ref> whereby our particular operationalization of cognitive load might increase anchoring effects, but this may not be the case for the myriad of different types of cognitive-load manipulations present across the anchoring literature that were all coalesced under our cognitive-load variable.</p><p>Overall, the meta-study provided some results that support the meta-analytic findings and other results that appeared inconsistent, which might reflect two possibilities.</p><p>The first possibility is that the meta-study was not representative of the studies in the literature. For instance, we used a memory-load task to induce cognitive load, whereas some studies in the literature used time pressure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b178">Simonson &amp; Drolet, 2004)</ref>. In this way, the meta-study may also suffer from a mono-operation bias in which it only adopts one manifestation of a given manipulation, and thus its conclusions may be limited to the approaches we adopted <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Shadish et al., 2002)</ref>. Another dimension of representativeness could be that the online participants in the meta-study were substantially different than those across the literature, which included a mixture of field, laboratory, and online participants. In the Online Appendix E we report coefficients for the exploratory moderators from the meta-analysis and do see significant moderation as a function of whether the study was run with an online panel or in-person participants.</p><p>The second explanation for the inconsistencies could be a combination of publication bias along with other non-reporting biases relevant to the meta-analytic database. That is, incomplete reporting of nonsignificant moderation in published studies (i.e., collapsing over levels of a moderator when reporting results), suppression of failed replications, or other findings that contradict existing theories could all lead to an artificial inflation or deflation of effect size differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Coburn &amp; Vevea, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b201">Vevea, Coburn, &amp; Sutton, 2019)</ref>. The advantage of meta-studies is that they give every moderator equivalent opportunity under the assumption of equivalent operationalization of the manipulations. This means that results cannot be due to publication incentives or outcome/moderator reporting bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>How do people make numeric estimates? Whether wondering how much to bid in an eBay auction, contemplating how many people will support a policy, or assessing how long the commute to work will take, these estimates have important implications for numerous decisions. The anchoring literature offers one answer: people use recently-encountered numeric stimuli as an input to these judgments. Despite the generality of this literature, there remain numerous unanswered questions.</p><p>We caution that while our meta-analysis and meta-study are the most comprehensive exploration of moderators of the anchoring effect to date, the results are by no means definitive. Anchoring is an extremely broad research area, both conceptually and substantively. Given the breadth of the anchoring literature, it is necessary to be cautious about assumptions of generality from studies that involve only a particular anchoring stimulus and a particular operation of a moderator. As such, we encourage researchers and practitioners to use the current manuscript as starting-point for future lines of anchoring research rather than as the catalog of the "average effect size" for each moderator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>What is an Anchoring Effect?</head><p>While the anchoring effect is an exceptionally large literature that spans the behavioral, and related, sciences, its theoretical space is quite fragmented. After 50 years of research on this phenomenon, there is no one theory that provides a parsimonious explanation of all of the latent drivers that produce this seminal effect -and there may not need be one (see below). We suggest that the features of this literature that have facilitated its proliferation are also what has prevented it from reaching theoretical clarity in terms of clearly differentiated characteristics for the categorization of an anchoring effect.</p><p>The range of what counts as anchoring is extremely wide. In the current manuscript, we operationalized anchoring effects as cases where decision-makers are presented a single number before making a numeric judgment. Across the literature, we argue that there are three major paradigms of anchoring that vary in how informative the anchors are intended to be, across which we tested the impact of non-diagnostic (vs. diagnostic) anchors. In paradigm one, people make a numeric estimate following a comparative question (i.e., higher or lower) against a randomly-determined number. In paradigm two, people make a numeric estimate following exposure to incidental (e.g., primed) numbers in the environment. In paradigm three, anchors are presented in contexts in which they may have normative value (e.g., a list price of a house). 17 While the literature has an inclusive structure for characterizing anchoring effects, we suggest that it may be more beneficial for scientific advancement and practical utilization of anchoring effects to instead characterize anchoring as a class of effects rather than as an individual phenomenon. As an example, consider two cases: anchoring on general knowledge questions such as the length of the Mississippi River (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Jacowitz &amp; Kahneman, 1995)</ref> and anchoring on the list price of a house when making housing-price judgments (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Northcraft &amp; Neale, 1987</ref>) (i.e., paradigms one and three). These paradigms both involve assimilation in the direction of the anchoring values, but the underlying processes driving these effects likely differ substantially.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evaluating Existing Theories</head><p>In <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> in the introduction, we outlined the predictions for each of the seven existing theories within the anchoring literature. We should note a few important points.</p><p>First, most theories do not speak explicitly to all of the moderators in the anchoring literature. Anchoring-and-Adjustment, the oldest account, is tied with Selective Accessibility for the most explicit predictions at eight, whereas newer accounts such as Noise Theory only make explicit predictions about three moderators. It's not pragmatic to count winners and losers because there is a potential trade-off between how accurate each theory is and how much theoretical space it covers with explicit predictions. For example,</p><p>whereas Anchoring-and-Adjustment is incorrect about some moderators (e.g., directional</p><p>anchors, transparently random anchors), Noise Theory and Scale Distortion have accurate, but more limited, predictions. Adjudicating theoretical breadth versus accuracy is likely quite difficult and not the intended goal of the current manuscript. Additionally, it is arguable that the two most recently-proposed accounts, Noise Theory and Extremeness Aversion, may serve as addenda to the initial Anchoring-and-Adjustment theory rather than as stand-alone theories, and as such make the same predictions as</p><p>Anchoring-and-Adjustment for most moderators.</p><p>As another reason to avoid merely counting number of predictions, we caution that some theories have received far more attention than others or may have other relevant process tests. For example, the Selective Accessibility Hypothesis has been applied in a much broader set of paradigms and moderators than other, newer theories, and has assessed its mechanisms with additional reaction-time measures. Further, even though the Selective Accessibility Hypothesis made many correct predictions (e.g., delay), it is not always internally consistent. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Strack and Mussweiler (1997)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Mussweiler and Englich (2005)</ref> argue that something far more incidental like a subliminal prime does activate anchor-consistent knowledge. Another reason for not picking winners is that some theories use process evidence that is not mutually comparable across theories and uses alternative measures such as reaction time (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Mussweiler &amp; Strack, 2000b)</ref>. However, we should note that some of this process evidence has failed to replicate in high-powered replication attempts <ref type="bibr">(Harris et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Even within a given moderator, the exact operationalization might yield meaningfully different results. For example, some of the inconsistent empirical results between the meta-analysis and meta-study may reflect differences in how a moderator was operationalized (i.e., mono-operation bias in the meta-study). Within the meta-analysis, some moderators received little attention in the literature or had minimal variability in the studies, which we discuss in the future directions later. Other moderators had the opposite problem and were so inconsistent across studies that inference is limited. For example, because most studies using extreme anchors did not include a calibration study, the particular amount of extremity was likely sampled from the researchers' own intuitions. Another challenge is that existing theories were not developed to accommodate the numerous moderators in the literature, which is evidenced by the number of blank cells in  <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Gholson &amp; Barker, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>We do not intend for the above discussion to disparage existing theories. Instead, we recognize that the challenge of theorizing about the anchoring effect is inherent in the fact that the operationalization of the anchoring effect is both vague and extremely domain general. That is, one reason for the proliferation of theory around this phenomenon is due to the lack of clarity in defining the conceptual boundaries for the effect. In the following sections, we aim to provide guidance both for the conceptualization of the phenomenon and the defining of theoretical structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Guidance for Theory Development</head><p>In the sections below we begin by offering recommendations about how to improve testing existing theories. Afterwards, we integrate insights from the current review to recommend how future theories should attempt to encapsulate anchoring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Salience.</head><p>In terms of salience, while there has already been sufficient work regarding incidental anchoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Brewer &amp; Chapman, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">R. A. Klein et al., 2018)</ref>, there has been far less attention on temporal delays between the anchor and judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">(Mussweiler, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Yoon &amp; Fong, 2019)</ref>, optimal exposure time to anchors, and the role of competing information in the decision environment. More experimental investigations that test the degree of delay between the anchor presentation and the target judgment could be useful for disentangling existing theories. These existing theories differ in their reliance on lower-level versus higher-level cognitions. For example, in terms of lower-level cognitions, Many existing studies may direct attention to the anchor via a comparison question (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Jacowitz &amp; Kahneman, 1995)</ref> while others have the anchor embedded along with other numeric and textual information (e.g., list prices were embedded among a whole portfolio of relevant information for real-estate appraisals <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Northcraft &amp; Neale, 1987)</ref>. What types of competing information detract from versus enhance the salience and impact of anchors?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Inference.</head><p>How and when people draw inferences across contexts remains a key direction for future research. Numerous instructions and manipulations have aimed to separate anchoring from a conversational inference interpretation <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Grice, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">Schwarz, 1994)</ref> by signaling explicitly or implicitly that the anchor lacks diagnostic information. But, the argument for inference making is that decision-makers use inferential cues because more often than not, information is presented for a reason <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Grice, 1975)</ref>. While there is extensive research in social psychology about how individuals derive inference, we encourage anchoring researchers to start with the minimalist hypothesis proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">McKoon and Ratcliff (1992)</ref> to explain how decision-makers generate the minimal necessary inferences to bridge a coherence gap. That is, when there is a logical step missing in a sequence, the mind will seek to fill that gap with the simplest explanation to make the sequence coherent. For example, when judging the length of the Mississippi River and considering the comparison question about whether the river is greater than or less than 3,500 miles, there is a gap about why that 3,500 is part of the question. The minimal inference is that the 3,500 miles number has some relevance to the true answer.</p><p>Existing moderators aim to fill this gap by, for example, telling/showing participants explicitly that the 3,500 was derived randomly (i.e., transparently random anchors). Other do so implicitly by warning against anchors (i.e., debiasing) or reducing the decision-relevance of the anchor (i.e., diagnositicity stimulus/dimension). In the current meta-analysis, we did not have enough precision in the literature to tease apart the exact roles of the anchor stimulus/dimension, but encourage further exploration. In particular, how similar/different <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Evers, Imas, &amp; Kang, 2022)</ref> does the anchor need to be to generate an inference that it is a diagnostic cue for the judgment?</p><p>These inferences also likely differ between the reviewed anchoring paradigms. For paradigm one, there are likely not a wide array of inferences because the paradigm is controlled and simplistic. Thus, for paradigm one, we encourage researchers to explore how the inference affects beliefs both about the central tendency of the anchor and the distribution of possible true values <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Turner &amp; Schley, 2016)</ref>. This is relevant to a range of anchoring theories. For example, according to the Attitudinal Perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Wegener et al., 2010)</ref>, anchoring occurring via central route processing should influence the strength of that belief which should present itself as having a tighter distribution of potential values.</p><p>This range of potential values is also relevant to Anchoring-and-Adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">(Quattrone et al., 1984)</ref>, Extremeness Aversion <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Lewis et al., 2019)</ref> For paradigm three, which contains anchors embedded in a contextualized environment (e.g., legal settings, real estate prices), we expect to see a much wider range of inferences. For example, past work has looked at signals of confidence or accuracy imbued with precise anchors <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Jerez-Fernandez et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b181">Smith &amp; Marshall, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Zhang &amp; Schwarz, 2013)</ref>. Similarly, does the extremity of the anchor change the perceived credibility of its source? As another example, consider the case of first offers in negotiations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Galinsky &amp; Mussweiler, 2001</ref>). Depending on other contextual cues, the anchor could be seen as the starting point for the seller, or the lowest reasonable offer they are willing to take, or the seller's belief about the highest price the buyer may be willing to pay. Thus, for paradigm three, theories can better attempt to accommodate the range of potential inferences derived from anchors in each decision context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Memory.</head><p>There exist far more potential moderators in the space of memory that have yet to be explored. So far, anchoring research has mostly considered the perceived anchor extremity (e.g., comparing the anchor against exemplars already within memory) and decision-maker's certainty in their judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b185">(Smith et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Turner &amp; Schley, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Both of these factors serve as inputs to the range of plausible values for a target judgment (C.-Y. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Lee &amp; Morewedge, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Lewis et al., 2019)</ref>. However, there is a difference between the total information about a target judgment stored in the associative network within memory and what is retrieved/activated via spreading activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Collins and Loftus (1975)</ref>.</p><p>And, what gets activated is logically important for how decision-makers construct their judgments (The Selective Accessibility Hypothesis and the Activation Account <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Chapman &amp; Johnson, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b189">Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997)</ref>. While our meta-analysis provides evidence that the amount of total knowledge someone has about a target judgment reduces the magnitude of the anchoring effect, does the particular type of knowledge in memory matter <ref type="bibr" target="#b191">(Tannenbaum, Fox, &amp; Ülkümen, 2017)</ref>? Epistemic uncertainty is a case where, for example, information about the length of the Mississippi River is unknown to the decision-maker but is knowable via an internet search. Conversely, aleatory uncertainty is a case where, for example, the true value of a house price is unknown to the decision-maker and is not knowable via search -rather the eventual selling price for a house is due in part to stochastic processes. This differentiation is likely relevant to Noise Theory (C.-Y. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Lee &amp; Morewedge, 2022)</ref> and would also impact perceptions of what anchors are perceived as extreme values <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Lewis et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Mussweiler &amp; Strack, 2001a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b160">Quattrone et al., 1984)</ref>.</p><p>If all theories agree that the anchor is providing/activating knowledge to some extent, then understanding decision-maker's prior knowledge is pertinent for understanding the theoretical mechanisms by which judgments shift in the presence of the information being provided by the anchor. We strongly encourage future research to better catalog not just how much knowledge decision-makers have about a target judgment, but what types of knowledge. For instance, there is a long tradition of differences in activation and use of episodic (i.e., experienced) versus semantic (i.e., general knowledge) exemplars in memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b195">(Tulving, 2002)</ref>. As an illustration of these possibilities, consider an anchor in the context of Seattle's highest summer temperature. The impact of a high anchor may have a stronger impact on someone who has lived through a Seattle summer (i.e., episodic) relative to someone with only semantic knowledge of Seattle's weather.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Depth of Information Processing.</head><p>If anchors are non-diagnostic cues that get conflated into subsequent judgments (at least in paradigms one and two) then in what ways do slower, more deliberative, regulatory aspects of cognition (e.g., System 2 processing) play into their use <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Evans, 2008</ref> understanding what is the minimal amount of processing required to observe an anchoring effect. For example, investigators might explore a continuum of no, low, moderate, and high load rather than just no load versus high load.</p><p>One greatly overlooked aspect of depth-of-information-processing is whether increasing/decreasing processing capacity influences attention to the anchoring stimulus (i.e., Salience), what information is derived from the anchor (i.e., Inference), and what information from long-term memory is accessibility at the moment of the judgment (i.e., Memory). Said another way, a given moderator related to processing capacity may impact any/all of the other components, and thus experimental approaches will need to more carefully dissociate, via controls and measurement, exactly where the information-processing-capacity manipulation is operating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Updating Existing Theories and Introducing New Theories.</head><p>As evident from table 1, existing theories do not encapsulate all current moderators, let alone some new moderators proposed above. To move our understanding of anchoring effects forward, existing theories will need to be updated to be more comprehensive, or replaced by newer, more comprehensive theories. Below we lay out recommendations for updated and new theories of anchoring:</p><p>1) Tie theories to paradigm: As discussed in the introduction, paradigms one, two, and three likely reflect three analogous patterns of results but are likely produced by distinct psychological processes. Most current theories were developed primarily using studies that employ paradigm one, but have been generalized to explain phenomena using paradigm three. We recommend that updated and new theories should situate themselves within paradigm one or paradigm three. Only after validating the mechanisms within that paradigm can that theory be extended to apply to other paradigms. For example, it may be that the best theory for paradigm one may not be appropriate for explain outcomes from paradigm two or paradigm three.</p><p>2) Specify theories with regard to each anchoring component: Our review of the literature highlights that existing theories and past moderators correspond to four components of anchoring: salience, inference making, memory, and depth of information processing. While we do not believe that anchoring theories need to be able to make predictions across paradigms, within a paradigm, theories should be comprehensive about how anchors operate based on boundaries and processes outlined by all of the four components. This is necessary for theory testing as it allows for direct comparison of predictions across theories. Additionally, this completeness enables potential falsification of theories. If there are likely many separable inputs into an anchoring effect, then specifying, measuring, and controlling for other processes is necessary for testing the validity of a focal hypothesized process.</p><p>3) Process evidence and individual differences: Once theories have been properly specified within each component, collecting process evidence for a given theory becomes more straightforward. For example, if researchers wanted to explore the range-of-plausible-values-mechanism within Anchoring-and-Adjustment, simply asking participants for this range would not be sufficient for identifying theoretical mechanisms because this judgment is likely the consequence multiple processes. But, having defined how this range relates to decision-makers' memory and the depth of their information processing should facilitate measurements of unique processes that should make theories more falsifiable. For example, if there is an "adjustment" mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Epley &amp; Gilovich, 2001</ref>), there should be direct evidence of incremental iterations in the judgment. Similarly, if the anchor activates information consistent with the anchor value, either spontaneously via the comparison question <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Chapman &amp; Johnson, 1999)</ref> or through a confirmatory hypothesis test <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">(Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997)</ref>, this difference should be evident in decision-makers' memories for how they formed the judgment. And as discussed above with regard to inference making, what makes decision-makers infer a particular anchor as extreme <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Lewis et al., 2019)</ref> or feel more or less certain about the judgment task (C.-Y. Lee <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">&amp; Morewedge, 2022)</ref> likely depends on the specific inferences they derive.</p><p>Related to process evidence, another avenue greatly understudied within this literature is the role of individual differences. However, we caution that instead of connecting individual differences to the extent of anchoring directly. Ideally the literature would thread individual differences through each of the four component processes that contribute to anchoring. Individuals differ in the extent to which they attend to numbers in a decision environment (i.e., influencing the salience <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Fagerlin et al., 2007)</ref>, the likelihood they engage in inference making <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">(Uleman, Adil Saribay, &amp; Gonzalez, 2008)</ref>, how and how much they retrieve from memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">(Miller &amp; Unsworth, 2018)</ref>, and the depth of information processing applied to a judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Petty &amp; Cacioppo, 1986</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4) Refine and formalize theories:</head><p>To date, there have been limited attempts to mathematically model anchoring effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Lieder, Griffiths, M. Huys, &amp; Goodman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b196">Turner &amp; Schley, 2016)</ref>. If anchoring is as pervasive and influential as the introductions of many anchoring papers purport, then an eventual goal of theory should be prediction.</p><p>Numeric anchoring involves a quantitative anchor and a quantitative final judgment/estimate. Qualitative theories are a good starting point. But, anchoring is well equipped for formal models for theory testing and prediction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodological implications for researchers.</head><p>The present research also offers insights for how researchers may approach running anchoring studies. For example, researchers may use the estimated effect sizes from the meta-analysis as a baseline when determining sample sizes for future studies. Moreover, for study design, one big issue alluded to earlier is the limited number of papers explicitly running calibration studies prior to the main experiments. To know whether an anchor is high, low, extreme, or plausible, it is necessary to evaluate decision-maker's pre-existing knowledge about a given decision domain in addition to the range of knowledge in the population. This calibration is a necessary step for internal validity of anchoring studies, particularly when attempting to develop and test theories. We would also strongly encourage greater stimulus sampling, including from different anchoring values and questions, in subsequent research to be able to fully map anchoring effects across its "myriad of domains" highlighted in the introduction of many anchoring papers.</p><p>We also provide some caution in how researchers choose their dependent variables for anchoring. As discussed in the meta-analytic methodology, there exist multiple types of anchoring-effect dependent variables that were not possible to be coalesced into a single meta-analytic database such as high versus low and high/low versus control. The most common dependent variable in this literature is the traditional numeric estimate typically following exposure to either a low or high anchor. This pairing has the most interpretable treatment effect as it represents the relative difference in judgment as a function of the level of the anchor, whereas versions comparing an anchor to a no-anchor control only represent half of the effect (see Online Appendix C). Using correlations has been useful when anchors are sampled from a distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ariely et al., 2003)</ref>. However, given the above discussion about the necessity of calibration studies, and that the correlational studies do not use them, said studies become difficult to interpret. Moreover, in our analysis of the literature, we found that the anchor-estimate gap is the most problematic for inference. First, each gap's overall magnitude is not meaningful. That is, the gap only indicates relative increases or decreases in the magnitude of the effect as a function of an orthogonal moderator.</p><p>Additionally, results using this dependent variable were the most different from those presented here in the main text (see Online Appendix H). Lastly, recent evidence suggests that the construct validity of the anchor-estimate gap is, at best, weakly correlated with anchoring, and at worst, strongly negatively correlated with anchoring [Blinded for review, 2025]. Given the above limitations, we would encourage future research to mostly focus on the high versus low and the high/low versus control experimental setups.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Guidance for Practitioners</head><p>Beyond establishing the robustness of anchoring across domains (e.g., law, management, economics, and marketing), the results on boundary conditions in this manuscript suggest three recommendations for practitioners who may attempt to use anchors in managerial settings. The first direction concerns finding "optimal" values to use in policy and firm settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Goswami &amp; Urminsky, 2016)</ref>. That is, despite the prevalence of anchoring, there is very little research attempting to quantify the effect so that practitioners can select optimal anchors <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Turner &amp; Schley, 2016)</ref>. This question of optimal anchor values relates to anchor extremity: at what threshold do anchors no longer lead to assimilation? In the meta-analysis we found no consistent moderation of extremity but found an increase with more extreme anchors in the meta-study. To understand the role of extremity a more effective study design requires assessing anchor values at each level of a baseline distribution -rather than at just the 3rd/97th, 15th/85th, and 30th/70th</p><p>percentiles. This would offer a fuller picture by mapping the extremity continuum and identifying optimal anchor values.</p><p>Second, we would also encourage practitioners to explore which features of their particular decision-making context make an anchor appear more or less diagnostic.</p><p>Moderators related to dimension and transparent randomness had some of the largest impacts on effect sizes in the meta-analysis and meta-study. If these moderators have the large potential impact for organizations and policy agents, then understanding how these moderators operate and their boundary conditions are necessary for developing effective anchor-based interventions.</p><p>Third, we should offer a cautionary observation about the potential risks of using anchors. It was rare to observe a negative impact of anchoring (i.e., a reversal), suggesting that employing anchors might not immediately backfire. However, in the primary meta-analysis of high-versus-low anchors 7.5% of the sample had negative effect sizes. It would be prudent for practitioners to be cognizant of under what conditions those negative effects could occur. For example, in line with the inference-making portion of our above anchoring framework, there is the potential for decision-makers to make an inference that the firm is using the anchor in a coercive manner, potentially leading to consumer reactance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>50 years ago, researchers asked participants about the percentage of African countries in the United Nations <ref type="bibr" target="#b198">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>. Since that investigation, there has been thousands of investigations across domains, at least seven theories proposed, multiple replications, and likely countless classroom demonstrations. This manuscript organizes the theoretical underpinnings of numeric anchoring effects with a large-scale empirical test of canonical theoretical moderators, and proposes a new framework of underlying components and paradigms of anchoring effects. As anchoring research continues, it must be mindful of both the way it describes the processes of interest and the full theoretical space it occupies. Else, anchoring can apply to almost everything per its status as a robust class of effects yet fail to describe anything alone adequately.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>, each impressive in their own right.

Additionally, this coding correlated r = -0.20 with transparently random anchors, r = 0.28 with contextually diagnostic anchors, and r = 0.40 with directional anchors. As such, the small and non-significant results of the multivariate models reflect the residual influence of the comparison question, controlling for these other correlated predictors. Results both of the multivariate and univariate models provide highly consistent results: compared to the common case when a comparison question is used (dummy = 0), the anchor effect is sizeably smaller when there is no comparison question (β's -0.16 to -0.50).Different Stimuli/Dimensions. Results were extremely consistent for this moderator across analyses: anchors on about different targets or on different dimensions (e.g., S.

As an additional complication, we note that even when a theory could be applied to a moderator, there may still be ambiguity about how each theory's mechanism(s) may operate under different conditions or what the baseline conditions are assumed to be. For example, cognitive load may either lead to increased anchoring effects or decreased anchoring effects according to Numeric Priming. That is, if load prevents consideration of alternative numeric inputs or responses, there may be greater anchoring. However, if load hinders processing of the anchor by commanding the decision-maker's attention, there may be less anchoring. In short, theory testing and pruning becomes infeasible when theories are not completely clear about the boundaries of the mechanisms within the theory</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

On the other hand, Selective Accessibility requires higher-level cognitions through hypothesis testing, and Extremeness Aversion involves an intermediary judgment of what makes something "extreme." In principle, different amounts of delay manipulate the salience of the anchor in decision-makers' percept. Further, while evidence from the meta-analysis suggests that anchoring effects do not appear reliable with incidental/primed exposure, what is the minimum amount of exposure/salience needed to produce a reliable effect? Is there a plateau for exposure? Finally, researchers should experiment with richer environments with information from competing attributes that could reduce the relative salience of the anchor.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
