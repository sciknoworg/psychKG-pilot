			<abstract>
				<p>Although mouse-tracking has been taken as a real-time window on different aspects of human decision-making processes, whether purely semantic information affects response conflict at the level of motor output as measured though mouse movements is still unknown. Here, across two experiments, we investigated the effects of semantic knowledge by predicting participants&apos; performance in a standard keyboard task and in a mouse-tracking task through distributional semantics, a usage-based modelling approach to meaning. In Experiment 1, participants were shown word pairs and were required to perform a two-alternative forced choice task selecting either the more abstract or the more concrete word, using standard keyboard presses. In Experiment 2, participants performed the same task, yet this time response selection was achieved by moving the computer mouse. Results showed that the involvement of semantic components in the task at hand is observable using both standard reaction times (Experiment 1) as well as using indexes extracted from mouse trajectories (Experiment 2). In particular, mouse trajectories reflected the response conflict and its temporal evolution, with larger deviation for increasing word semantic relatedness. These findings support the validity of mouse-tracking as a method to detect deep and implicit decision-making features. Additionally, by demonstrating that a usage-based model of meaning can account for the different degrees of cognitive conflict associated with task achievement, these findings testify the impact of the human semantic memory on decision-making processes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Introduction</head><p>In the last decade, mouse-tracking has seen enduring and rising popularity across several branches of cognitive science, mainly because of the methodological and theoretical advantages this approach carries <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Stillman, Shen, &amp; Ferguson, 2018)</ref>. As compared to reaction times, indeed, mouse-tracking has been revealed to be particularly reliable in isolating the dynamics of response conflict, by quantifying the relative directness with which participants make their decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Freeman, 2018)</ref>. That is, using mouse-tracking it is possible to quantify the stages by which the decision process unfolds (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Kieslich et al., 2019)</ref>. Accordingly, mouse-tracking has been successfully used across a large number of domains such as language <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lins, &amp; Sch√∂ner, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Spivey et al., 2005)</ref>, social cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Freeman et al., 2016)</ref> and memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gatti et al., 2022a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Papesh, &amp; Goldinger, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Papesh et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Briefly, in mouse-tracking tasks, participants are required to move from a starting point position (i.e., typically placed in the middle-bottom part of the screen) to select either of the alternatives presented in the two upper corners of the screen. On the assumption that mouse movements (i.e., hand movements) are executed in parallel with the decision that participants are required to make (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Freeman, &amp; Ambady, 2010)</ref>, mouse-tracking packages allow to quantify the conflict of the choice and its evolution, which cannot be directly assessed using only reaction times <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Stillman et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The magnitude of the decision conflict is generally quantified by computing the maximum deviation from the direct path (i.e., the furthest point on the actual trajectory from the idealized straight trajectory between the starting point and the selected stimulus), while the decision evolution is quantified by means of sample entropy, which measures the degree of movement irregularity and unpredictability (for a complete discussion on other possible indexes see, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Stillman et al., 2018)</ref>. More specifically, the greater the deviation from a straight path or the trajectory irregularity, the greater the decision conflict. In addition to this, mouse-tracking provides a precious real-time window into the temporal sequence of the processes subserving the conflict, being informative about the time at which the decision takes place.</p><p>Although mouse-tracking has been employed to investigate different cognitive functions, including the language domain, the decision conflict subserving word meaning processes are still largely unknown. Insofar, evidence for an effect of word meaning on response selection has been mainly observed in priming tasks, hence focusing mostly on reaction times. For instance, in lexical priming tasks, the response to a target word (e.g., dog) has been systematically shown to vary as a function of the preceding linguistic context (i.e., the prime word; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Meyer &amp; Schvaneveldt, 1971)</ref>. Typically, the target word elicits a faster response after a meaning-related prime word (e.g., cat) as compared to PREDICTING HAND MOVEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTICS: EVIDENCE FROM MOUSE-TRACKING when it is presented after an unrelated word (e.g., pen). Similar evidence has been gathered from a previous mouse-tracking study, in which participants were asked to indicate which target word, among two possible alternatives, was more associated with a preceding cue word <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hindy et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> but for other studies on lexical decision see also: <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barca &amp; Pezzulo, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dale, et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dale, et al., , 2007</ref>.</p><p>Results showed that the response conflict, as indexed by the maximum deviation, was smaller for more semantically associated correct cue-target pairs as compared to less semantically associated pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hindy et al., 2009)</ref>. This is compatible with the view of an automatic contextual binding of actions and verbal information (for a review: <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Garc√≠a &amp; Ib√°√±ez, 2016a)</ref>, according to which various details of an action's unfolding are revealed by kinematic variables that cannot be thus simply accounted by classical reaction-time tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Garc√≠a &amp; Ib√°√±ez, 2016b</ref>; but see also: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Afonso et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Garc√≠a-Marco et al., 2019</ref>). Yet, in the study by Hindy and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hindy et al., 2009</ref>) semantic relatedness was operationalized on a dichotomous basis (i.e., by comparing weakly associated with strongly associated words) and participants' performance was directly predicted by this very same dimension (i.e., participants had to select the target word most semantically related to the cue). In contrast, here we aimed at predicting mouse tracking performance based on a continuous semantic index.</p><p>Here, building upon this evidence, we take advantage from distributional models (DSMs) to explore semantic involvement in decision making using mouse tracking. DSMs induce words meanings from large databases of natural language data, representing them as high-dimensional numerical vectors.</p><p>More critically, DSMs are thought to well capture the structure of semantic memory, in which word meanings would be conceived as distributed representations populating a continuous mental space <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(G√ºnther, Rinaldi &amp; Marelli, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Jones et al., 2015b)</ref>. On these grounds, DSMs may be considered the ideal tool to probe whether word meanings affect not only the processes driving reaction times, but also the programming and execution of (hand) movements. Accordingly, previous studies have shown that word relatedness measures extracted from DSMs can predict lexical priming effects at the item-level <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(G√ºnther et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">see also: Jones et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mandera et al., 2017)</ref>. In these studies, word meaning was indeed operationalized as a quantification of a word distribution over linguistic contexts from large corpora of natural text.</p><p>In the present study, participants were therefore shown several word pairs and were required to indicate the more abstract one (or the more concrete one, depending on the experimental condition).</p><p>In Experiment 1, participants answered using the keyboard (i.e., in a standard keyboard task), while in Experiment 2, a different sample of participants was asked to perform the task by moving the PREDICTING HAND MOVEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTICS: EVIDENCE FROM MOUSE-TRACKING mouse. We then predicted participants' responses in a two-alternative forced choice task using the degree of semantic relatedness between the two words as extracted from DSMs. Hence, although word relatedness was not a primary dimension for performing the task, we nevertheless expected this dimension to influence participants' performance.</p><p>Building on seminal body of work, the present study extends it in four different ways. Firstly, in this study we predicted participants' behavior in a mouse-tracking paradigm on a continuous scale (i.e., semantic relatedness extracted from DSMs), while previous works only employed categorical predictors (e.g., weakly associated vs. strongly associated words; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dale et al., 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dale et al., , 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hindy et al., 2009)</ref>, with our approach more reliably reflecting recent models of semantic memory conceiving word meanings as distributed representations populating a continuous mental space <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Jones et al., 2015b)</ref>. Secondly, and differently from previous studies, the task is not explicitly focusing on semantic similarity, but rather on concreteness judgements, thus investigating the (semantic) processes involved at an implicit level. Thirdly, it should be noted that the semantic relatedness metric employed here is not derived from human-based ratings (which in turn were employed in previous research), but it is an independent-source index extracted from natural language regularities, with the architecture of word-embeddings being consistent with relatively simple, psychologically-grounded associative learning mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(G√ºnther et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Rinaldi &amp; Marelli, 2020)</ref>. Supporting this choice, recently it has been indeed argued that, in order to improve our knowledge of the cognitive processes underlying an experimental task (and to avoid explanatory circularity), studies should strive to employ predictors built from sources independent from human-based ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Westbury, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">and</ref> for an example of this effect on semantic fluency see: <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Jones et al., 2015a)</ref>. Consistent with this, our approach allows to predict participants' behavior in the task at hand starting from independent models that replicate the structure of semantic memory by applying a learning mechanism to environmental regularities (i.e., word co-occurrences). Finally, by performing the same task with two different procedures (i.e., keyboard vs. mouse), the present study could provide evidence regarding how different methods allow to distinctively detect deep and implicit features of human behavior. In particular, we predict that the higher the semantic relatedness between the words to be judged, the higher the response conflict. This should be reflected in the specific profiles of hand movement trajectories, with a higher maximum deviation from the direct path as a function of increasing semantic relatedness between the two words presented.</p></div>

All participants were native Italian speakers, had normal or corrected to normal vision and were na√Øve to the purpose of the study. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before the experiment. The protocol was approved by the psychological ethical committee of the University of Pavia (Italy) and participants were treated in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Distributional semantic model</head><p>Vector representations for the words used in this study were extracted from a DSM obtained via the application of neural networks, and in particular the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) method, an approach originally proposed by <ref type="bibr">Mikolov and colleagues (2013)</ref>: when using CBOW, the obtained vector dimensions capture the extent to which a target word is reliably predicted by the contexts in which it appears. The model, released by <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Marelli (2017)</ref>, was trained on itWaC, a free Italian text corpus based on web-collected data and consisting of about 1.9 billion tokens (semantic relatedness values are available online via the SNAUT database: http://meshugga.ugent.be/snaut-italian-2/). The model is set on the following parameters: 5-word co-occurrence window, 400-dimension vectors, negative sampling with k = 10, subsampling with t = 1e -5 . This set of parameters defines the learning procedure used to induce word vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>. Co-occurrence window size indicates how large the considered lexical contexts are; in our case, a 5-word window indicates that we estimated predictions concerning 2 words on the left and 2 words on the right of the target word. The obtained vectors were used to estimate the degree of semantic relatedness (SRel) between word pairs by simply considering the cosine of the angle formed by them: the higher the SRel value (i.e., the closer the vectors in the multidimensional space), the more semantically related the words are expected to be.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Stimuli</head><p>The stimuli used in the present study were built starting from the words included in the Italian ANEW database <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Montefinese et al., 2014)</ref>. In this study, a large number of participants had been asked to rate Italian words on different scales, including concreteness (ranging from 1, abstract, to 9, concrete).</p><p>First, we retrieved from the ANEW database all the words included and generated all possible pairs, obtaining for each pair the difference in concreteness (i.e., by subtracting the word with the lower PREDICTING HAND MOVEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTICS: EVIDENCE FROM MOUSE-TRACKING 7 value of concreteness from the word with the higher value). Then, in order to allow participants in our study to easily discriminate the more concrete/abstract of the two words, we removed pairs with small difference in concreteness (i.e., concreteness difference &lt; 2.5). For each of the remaining word pairs, we extracted a SRel index based on the cosine of the angle formed by their corresponding vectors (see the previous section for a description of the DSM used). Finally, we selected 120 wordpairs guaranteeing almost uniformly distributed SRel values (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref> for SRel distribution and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref> for the distribution of concreteness difference for the word pairs selected).</p><p>In particular, in the final set of 120 word-pairs the concreteness difference ranged from 2.6 for the pair "poesia -penna" ("poetry -pen"), respectively with concreteness = 5.85 and = 8.45; to 5.4 for the pair "spirito -specchio" ("spirit -mirror"), respectively with concreteness = 3.15 and = 8.55.</p><p>SRel varied from very low (SRel = .007, e.g., "idrante -intelletto"; "hydrant -intellect") to relatively high values (SRel = .39, e.g., "musica -violino"; "music -violin"). To have an idea of how SRel increases, while keeping constant and high the concreteness difference (to allow participants to detect the more concrete or abstract item easily), in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> we report several examples of word pairs (translated in English) included in each .1 step of SRel. SRel and concreteness difference showed a small correlation, r = -.17. In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> we report the psycholinguistic characteristics of the word pairs included.  </p></div>

Sample entropy is thus obtained computing the negative natural logarithm of the conditional probability that this window remains similar across the trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hehman, Stolier, &amp; Freeman, 2015)</ref>. Initiation RTs is computed as the time elapsed between the click on the START button and the first hand-movement, while MDtime indexes the time at which the trajectory reaches the MD. These two dependent variables are considered to measure two different time windows of decision-making, with the former (initiation RTs) indicating the time at which the decisional process starts and the latter (MDtime) indicating the time at which a decision is finally achieved (see for a complete discussion regarding mouse-tracking variables: <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Stillman et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, overall RT is computed as the time elapsed between the click on the START button and the final click on the selected stimulus. This variable is therefore necessarily influenced by MDtime, in those trials in which the decision occurs later (i.e., higher MDtime) will also result in higher overall</p><p>RTs.</p><p>All the dependent variables were computed only on the trials in which participants answered correctly, using the mousetrap package <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kieslich, et al., 2019)</ref>. All trajectories were normalized into 101 time-steps and remapped symmetrically in order to allow for direct comparison of trajectories which differed in duration and number of data points. Initiation RTs, MDtime and overall RTs were all log-transformed.</p><p>The statistical analyses were performed using R-Studio (RStudio Team, 2015). We estimated five separated linear mixed models (LMMs), one for each dependent variable, with the lme4 R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref>. Pseudo-R¬≤ were computed using the summ function from the jtools R package <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Long, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>As for Experiment 1, for each LMM, we included SRel, concreteness difference, frequency difference and length difference as continuous predictors, while subjects and items were included as random intercepts in all the models estimated. To account for multiple comparisons, since we estimated five models with as dependent variable indexes emerging from the same set of behaviors, we set Œ± = .01 (i.e., Œ± = .05/ number of indexes tested).</p><p>PREDICTING HAND MOVEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTICS: EVIDENCE FROM MOUSE-TRACKING</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>Non-accurate trials (151 trials on a total of 4800 trials) and trials in which overall RTs were faster than 300 ms or slower than 3000 ms (306 additional trials on a total of 4800 trials) were excluded from the analysis. Aberrant movements (i.e., trials in which the mousetrap R package was unable to compute the trajectories or in which MD was ¬± 3SD from the mean of the participants) were detected in 236 of the 4343 remaining trials and were discarded. Overall participants' accuracy was very high (M = .97, SD = .03). Descriptive statistics for the five variables are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 3</ref>.</p><p>The correlation matrix between the five dependent variables is reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>. Overall, the correlations ranged from very low, as the one between MD and MDtime (r = -.04), to high, as the one between overall RTs and MDtime (r = .67). As discussed previously, this latter correlation corroborates the fact that overall RTs is necessarily influenced by MDtime, since trials in which the decision occurs later (i.e., higher MDtime) will also result in higher overall RTs. Note that the correlations were computed on raw data, hence on a total of 4107 trials.  The model on MD had Pseudo-R¬≤ (total) = .26, Pseudo-R¬≤ (fixed effects) = .005. Results showed that the effect of SRel was significant, t(112) = 2.56, p = .01, b = .17, while the effects of concreteness, t(112) = -1.06, p = .28, b = -.01, frequency, t(112) = -.39, p = .69, b &lt; -.01, and length, t(111) = 1.45, p = .14, b &lt; .01, were not significant. See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> for a graphical representation of the actual trajectories collapsed as a function of three different levels of SRel.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Discussion</head><p>In the present study, we investigated the impact of word meaning on decision-making processes during a two-alternative forced choice concrete-abstract judgement task with. In Experiment 1 participants responded using standard keyboard presses, while in Experiment 2 we adopted a mousetracking approach. In particular, we combined data from distributional semantic models and from a mouse-tracking task to shed light on the response conflict driving word meaning processing. In both experiments, participants were shown several word-pairs and were required to indicate the more abstract word (or more concrete one) using the keyboard or the computer mouse. The semantic relatedness between the two words was manipulated in order to ideally test its possible influence on decision-making processes.</p><p>PREDICTING HAND MOVEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTICS: EVIDENCE FROM MOUSE-TRACKING</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>16</head><p>Across both experiments, our findings indicate that participants' judgements were affected by the semantic relatedness of the two words, although this was not a dimension directly involved in the task at hand. That is, in Experiment 1, the effect of semantic relatedness was significant, with slower response latencies for word pairs semantically more related. This was replicated and extended in Experiment analyzing data extracted from mouse trajectories across several different dependent variables. These results indicate that semantic relatedness can affect human behavior well beyond processing speed, testifying its influence also on online response conflict at the level of motor control.</p><p>The present study extends previous findings showing that the association strength between a cue and a target word can affect participants' performance in a mouse-tracking task <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hindy et al., 2009</ref>). Yet, in this previous study the semantic predictor was operationalized on a dichotomous basis (i.e., strongly associated vs. weakly associated pairs) and only limited to the relationship between the cue and the (correct) target word. In striking contrast, here the semantic relatedness between the two words was operationalized as a continuous variable. This represents a clear advantage, as such an operationalization would more reliably reflect the complex structure of the mental lexicon, especially considering that recent models of semantic memory conceive word meanings as distributed representations populating a continuous mental space <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Jones et al., 2015b)</ref>.</p><p>While the impact of semantic relatedness as extracted from DSMs on reaction times has been already established (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gatti et al., 2022b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">G√ºnther et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">see also: Jones et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mandera et al., 2017)</ref>, our study is the first to report its effect also on mouse-tracking variables. Indeed, previous studies have shown that semantic relatedness facilitates participants' reaction times, with faster responses occurring for more semantically related word-pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(G√ºnther, et al., 2016)</ref>. Here, we found a similar pattern for the overall reaction times, an index that takes into account the overall time window (i.e., from the movement initiation to the selection of the target word), hence also being possibly affected by the conflict arising during the evaluation process. Indeed, the other variables considered (namely, MD and MDtime) were particularly informative of decision-making processes.</p><p>That is, the results of the maximum deviation index suggest that the conflict increased with increasing semantic relatedness, as the furthest point on the actual trajectory was farther from the idealized straight trajectory for larger semantic relatedness values <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Freeman, 2018)</ref>. Overall, these findings can be interpreted by assuming that participants' choice is affected by the overlap between the positions of the two to-be-compared word-vectors (which account for the distributional pattern of these words in linguistic contexts and, thus, their meaning). Accordingly, participants would rely on their semantic memory structure to solve the task at hand and the more the vectors representing the two words would overlap (i.e., the more they would be semantically similar), the larger the cognitive conflict (i.e., the more the decision to be reached would be difficult).</p><p>Notably, regarding the time course of participants' decisions, our findings also show that the effects of semantic relatedness was relevant only in the online component of the choice (i.e., on MDtime) and in the overall reaction times. Indeed, MDtime results suggest that the time at which a decision occurred was delayed for more semantically similar words. Such an effect may have likely determined also the difference observed in terms of overall reaction times, a variable that is necessarily influenced by MDtime (i.e., trials in which the decision occurs later will also result in higher overall reaction times), as also observed in the moderate correlation between them. On the contrary, no effect was detectable on initiation reaction times: this indicates that, at this initial stage, the participants did not yet elaborate the two stimuli in terms of semantic relatedness. A possible explanation could be that the conflict observed between the meanings of the two words in the task at hand emerges at later stages of the decision process, thus allowing to fully observe it with higher reliability when analyzing data originating from mouse trajectories.</p><p>Our findings also contribute to the debate on decision making processes and, more specifically, on the possible influences between action and decision. Indeed, seminal theories proposed a serial view of the decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Newell &amp; Simon, 1972)</ref>. That is, according to these serial models, the decision would be first taken (i.e., the accumulation of relevant information to guide the choice for the task at end would reach a certain threshold) and, only later, the action (i.e., pressing a button to express the choice) would be executed. Yet, other theories supported by recent mouse-tracking findings rather proposed a parallel view, in which the decision would be continuously revised (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Freeman &amp; Ambady, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Resulaj et al., 2009)</ref>, hence conceiving it as an online process that can be constantly updated even during action execution. This is supported by several studies showing that in mouse-tracking tasks participants typically start the response movement before the completion of the decision process: for this very reason, the action's spatial and temporal dynamics would be paramount in unveiling the stages of the decision process <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Freeman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Selen et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Spivey et al., 2005)</ref>. Our data, with the effect of semantic relatedness on the online spatial parameter of the movement (i.e., MD), thus provide further support to the parallel view and suggest an online exploration of semantic memory contents while solving the task at hand.</p><p>Although DSMs are known to encode concreteness, up to a certain level <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hollis &amp; Westbury, 2016)</ref>, this piece of information does not overlap with semantic relatedness: related words, in fact, does not necessarily manifest the same degree of concreteness (church vs. religion, flag vs. patriotism). Indeed, we purposely selected the stimuli included in this study in order to allow for an easy detection of the target stimulus, as also testified by participants accuracy being higher than 94% in both experiments.</p><p>This could have consequently limited the impact of this dimension in the behavioral measures analyzed. Accordingly, in our analyses (i) we observe a very low correlation between concreteness PREDICTING HAND MOVEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTIONAL SEMANTICS: EVIDENCE FROM MOUSE-TRACKING 18 difference and semantic relatedness, and (ii) concreteness difference is dropped from model selection,</p><p>for all the dependent variables tested. The results of the present study, therefore, seem to genuinely depend on the relatedness between word meaning, in a way that is largely independent form their concreteness level (notwithstanding participants were asked to perform a concreteness-judgment task): the more the competitor word will be related to the target word, the more the response will be affected in terms of decision conflict. However, it should be noted that the results reported here could be partially dependent on the type of DSM used. That is, here we employed a DSM obtained via the application of neural networks, and in particular the Continuous Bag of Words method. Other methods, as the Skip-Gram or the GloVe, or other parameter settings could in principle lead to slightly different results.</p><p>Taken together, our study has relevant implications from both theoretical and methodological points of view. On a theoretical level, our data clarify the participation of semantic memory when the performance is measured through fine-grained hand movements. This adds to previous evidence showing that DSMs are able to predict with considerable accuracy human performance across a wide range of semantic tasks, such as multiple-choice tests <ref type="bibr">(Bullinaria &amp; Levy, 2012)</ref>, word categorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baroni &amp; Lenci, 2010)</ref>, word relatedness ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bruni, Tran, &amp; Baroni, 2014)</ref>, word naming and lexical decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Marelli &amp; Amenta, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gatti et al., 2022b)</ref>, as well as recognition memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gatti et al., 2022a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gatti et al., , 2022c</ref> and spatial judgements, <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gatti et al., 2022d)</ref>, providing in turn further support to the idea that DSMs are indeed extremely efficient in capturing the structure of human semantic memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(G√ºnther et al., 2019)</ref>. On a methodological level, the fact that DSMs paired with mousetracking can be used to investigate deep decision-making features of human behavior, open new avenues for probing the detailed processes subserving the mechanisms of semantic memory.</p><p>In conclusion, using distributional semantic models paired with mouse-tracking, we provided evidence for semantic memory involvement in decision-making as measured by hand movements.</p><p>Our findings well complement previous findings accounting for participants' behavior in semantic tasks and, more generally, provide insights on the impact of semantic memory on cognitive operations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Frequency distributions of the Semantic Relatedness values (A) and of concreteness difference (B) of the word-pairs included in this study.
