<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Short abstract</head><p>Why does poverty sometimes lead to risk aversion, and other times to risk taking? The Desperation Threshold Model (DTM) explains this paradox through a utility function with two key features: a cliff, where a small loss has devastating consequences, leading to risk avoidance; and rock bottom, where further losses no longer matter, only gains do, encouraging risk taking. We review evidence supporting the DTM from multiple disciplines. The DTM helps link individual decision making to societal issues such as economic inequality, crime deterrence, and welfare policy. We discuss critical areas for future research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Long abstract</head><p>The impacts of poverty and material scarcity on human decision making appear paradoxical. One set of findings associates poverty with risk aversion, whilst another set associates it with risk taking. We present an idealized general model, the 'desperation threshold model' (DTM), that explains how both these accounts can be correct. The DTM assumes a utility function with two features: a threshold or 'cliff', a point where utility declines steeply with a small loss of resources because basic needs can no longer be met; and a 'rock bottom', a point where utility is not made any worse by further loss of resources because basic needs are not being met anyway. Just above the threshold, people's main concern is not falling below, and they are predicted to avoid risk. Below the threshold, they have little left to lose, their most important concern is jumping above, and they are predicted to take risks that would otherwise be avoided. Versions of the DTM have been proposed under various names across biology, anthropology, economics and psychology. We review a broad range of relevant empirical evidence from a variety of societal contexts. Though the model primarily concerns individual decision making, it connects to a range of population-scale and societal issues such as: the consequences of economic inequality; the deterrence of crime; and the optimal design and behavioural consequences of the welfare state. We discuss a number of interpretative issues and offer an agenda for future DTM research that bridges disciplines.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Poverty and risk taking: A paradoxical relationship</head><p>In a sample of 17,000 Swedes, those with fewer financial resources are less likely to invest in risky assets like stocks and shares <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Calvet &amp; Sodini, 2014)</ref>. The relationship holds even after controlling for how much money they invest in total. It's not just that poorer individuals save less (which is unsurprisingly the case), it's that they are less likely to choose risky assets for what they do save. Since risky assets generally have higher long-run financial returns, poorer individuals, by avoiding risk, may be missing out on long-term gains. Taking less risk when one has fewer resources seems perfectly intuitive: one has less of a buffer in the event of a bad outcome, so one's first priority should be to avoid the financial situation getting any worse.</p><p>Yet consider U.S. state lotteries. These are highly risky: for every dollar handed over, the average return is only 70c; but that 70c on average is distributed as a large chance of getting nothing and a small chance of getting a big prize. Income is a strong predictor of buying lottery tickets: the lower people's incomes, the more they buy. In the 1% poorest zip codes in states with lotteries, the average adult spends $600 a year on lottery tickets, compared to $150 a year in the richest 1%. This is four times as much in absolute terms, and thirty times as much as a share of income <ref type="bibr">(The Economist, 2024)</ref>. This seems intuitive too: when people have so little that they can't make ends meet, they will grasp at any chance of getting a lump more resources, even a highly risky chance.</p><p>These two examples illustrate two plausible accounts of what poverty does to decision making: the first, that people in poverty cannot afford to take risk; the second, that they are especially prone to do so. Both accounts have been discussed and supported in the literature over decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Kish-Gephart, 2017)</ref>. As a consequence, the literature is confusing, containing "at least two distinct and, prima facie, inconsistent views" <ref type="bibr">(Banerjee, 2004, p. 60)</ref>: that people in poverty have too much to lose, and hence have a safety-first attitude <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Donkers et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Guiso &amp; Paiella, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Haushofer &amp; Fehr, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Lipton, 1968)</ref>; and that they have little left to lose, and hence throw prudence out the window <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Banerjee &amp; Newman, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Haisley et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Hsieh &amp; Pugh, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Patterson, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Pratt &amp; Cullen, 2005)</ref>. This paper presents and discusses an idealised model of decision making, the desperation threshold model (DTM). The DTM does not just accommodate, but actually predicts, that poverty would sometimes increase and sometimes decrease risk taking. The basic idea of the DTM has been proposed or implied in several disciplines at several times. It has generated multiple research programs, which often make little reference to one another. In this paper, we aim to: bring together the diverse versions of the DTM under one name; clarify assumptions, implications and conceptual issues; and review the relevant empirical evidence. The DTM also provides a bridge between individual-level (micro) and population-level (macro) processes. As such, it can be a parsimonious lens for understanding populationscale phenomena, such as the effects of inequality and different kinds of institutions on behaviour. We will review some of these societal applications, discuss issues of interpretation and falsifiability, and make some suggestions for how DTM research could be extended and refined later. First, though, we present the DTM itself.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.The desperation threshold model 2.1 The core of the model</head><p>To introduce the DTM, we employ the language of rational choice theory and utility functions. We are not committed to the claim that humans are always rational in the sense of 'deliberate', or that they maximise a single currency. However, utility functions and rational actions give us a useful language of idealisation to make explicit the motivational pattern that we propose.</p><p>When faced with a risky choice-such as deciding whether to take a bet-how do humans make decisions? Other things equal, they would prefer a larger payoff to a smaller one, but they are often particularly concerned to avoid the worst possible outcomes. Since the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bernoulli (1738)</ref>, researchers have captured the logic of their decisions with the idea that they maximize not expected wealth, but utility, where utility has a concave relationship with material resources.</p><p>The DTM extends this classical framework by introducing basic needs, and a minimum level of resources that allows these to be met. This generates a partly concave and partly convex utility function. At the point where basic needs are just meetable, there is a 'cliff', meaning the function is strongly concave. Gaining resources might be desirable, but losing any resource would jeopardise basic need satisfaction, and would thus be dire. At a lower resource point, utility is at 'rock bottom'. Here, the function is convex: losing more resources can't make things much worse, but gaining some could allow basic needs to be restored. Two examples of such functions-a step function, and a sigmoid-are shown in figure 1A.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Stephens, 1981)</ref>, the dashed line a sigmoid (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Kuznar, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Lybbert et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Winterhalder et al., 1999)</ref>. (B) Graphical illustration of why the curvature of the utility function determines optimal risk taking. In the convex segment, a resource gain brings more utility than an equal loss takes away. In the concave segment, the reverse is true.</p><p>The central insight found in all versions of the DTM concerns risky decisions, where risk is defined as variance in outcomes. For example, a lottery that might result in a £10 win, or might result in the loss of the £2 stake, is risky. Accepting £1 for sure is not. The utility impact of a risky decision depends on where on the resource curve one currently stands (figure 1B). At the top of the cliff, a loss would be much worse than a gain would be good. This makes upside gain much less interesting than avoiding the possible loss. At the bottom of the cliff, a small gain in resources could mean a huge utility gain, but a further loss of resources can scarcely make things worse. Thus, an agent should be averse to risk when resources are above the threshold level (and the utility function is locally concave), and choose risk when resources are below the threshold level (and it is locally convex). This principle surfaces in many contexts. In the last minutes of a knockout game of football (soccer), the leading team typically plays safe and tries to use up time, avoiding risk. The trailing team, on the contrary, takes desperate actions, such as the goalkeeper leaving their net empty to try to score a goal. What is usually a terrible idea becomes reasonable due to a threshold: losing 1-0 is not much worse than losing 2-0; but drawing 1-1 is dramatically better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Grounding the basic assumptions</head><p>The DTM is constituted by the twin elements of the cliff and the rock bottom, which between them produce a mixture of concavity and convexity in the utility function. Why is this a reasonable pattern to assume?</p><p>The cliff is just a segment where the utility function is markedly concave. Concavity in general is not contentious. People will use their first available resources to satisfy the desires that boost utility the most, and then turn to progressively less impactful ones. To put this the other way around, as one becomes poorer, it becomes more and more painful to lose any further money, as this requires cuts to increasingly impactful or 'basic' goods. When we replace the theoretical notion of utility with measures of health or life satisfaction, the observed associations with income or wealth are indeed concave (see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Nettle &amp; Dickins, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>For some fundamental goods, one needs to pay the full amount in order to get any of the benefit. For example, a person can be evicted for paying 90% of their rent; only if they pay 100% do they get the right to a home. This produces a nearverticality in the utility function around the point where the home is secured. Utility functions can thus have extremely steep regions, where a small increment of resources makes the difference between securing or losing basic needs.</p><p>We see basic needs as encompassing material safety and bodily integrity (food, shelter, warmth), but also what has been termed 'the social basis of respect' <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Rawls, 1971)</ref>. This is whatever one needs to have in order to be considered a recognised and adequate member of society; to be, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Sen (1983)</ref> puts it: 'free from public shame from failure to satisfy convention' (p. 167). Smith (1776) similarly stated that 'by necessities, I understand not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the customs of the country renders it indecent for creditable people…to be without. […] a creditable day labourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt. <ref type="bibr">' (p. 869-870)</ref>. Townsend argued that the poverty line was a point where, descending the income scale, a large number of families dropped out or were excluded from their community's style of living <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Townsend, 1979)</ref>. These various formulations all capture the idea that there are levels of income below which not just somatic but also basic social integrity is endangered.</p><p>As well as a cliff, the DTM assumes a rock bottom. There are several ways to justify this assumption. The first is a reductio ad absurdum: what would it mean for utility to go down endlessly? There must be a level of resources x so inadequate that the individual cannot satisfy any needs at all. Having 90% of x or 50% of x is not actually any worse than having x: the number of needs that can be satisfied is the same. Resources and needs satisfaction must then become decoupled at some point. Note that this decoupling, as well as occurring at the point where no needs can be met, also occurs if there is a 'safety net', and the individual has reached it. By a safety net we mean any mechanism that guarantees minimal wellbeing, such as social assistance, or an option to flee or default <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Kohler &amp; West, 1996)</ref>. Once one has reached the safety net level, a further loss of personal financial resources does not necessarily entail a further loss of utility.</p><p>A related justification of the rock bottom assumption comes from evolutionary reasoning. Natural selection favours behaviour that maximizes individuals' reproductive value. Reproductive value is bounded at zero. Along these lines, <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Rubin &amp; Paul (1979)</ref> argue that below the 'minimum income needed in order to support a mate and offspring' (p. 593), reproductive value is as good as zero, and hence natural selection would favour mechanisms that led to risk taking under these circumstances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">The predictions of the DTM</head><p>Having introduced the DTM, we turn to its predictions. We have mentioned two:</p><p>Caution prediction. Individuals whose resources are only just adequate to meet their basic needs will show greater avoidance of risk, compared to those whose resources are abundant; Desperation prediction. Individuals who are unable to meet their basic needs will take greater risk, compared to those who can meet their basic needs.</p><p>Though these predictions do follow from the assumptions, they are vague as stated. For example, the DTM does not predict that people just above the threshold will never take any risk. Some risks are very attractive, like a $1 ticket with a 95% chance of winning $1000. We would expect pretty much anyone to take this risk. It is helpful to classify risky options on the basis of the average return if they were taken many times. This is the sum of the possible resource outcomes multiplied by their respective probabilities (statistically, the expected value). A 'positiveaverage-return' risk is one where this number is positive; if you took it many times, you would gain more than you lost. For a 'negative-average-return' risk, your long-run losses would be larger than your gains. If the mapping of monetary resources to utility were linear, it would be simple: one would take positive-average-return risks and avoid negative-average-return ones.</p><p>This helps us make the DTM predictions more specific. We define the risk premium as the amount by which the average return of a risky option has to exceed zero in order for a rational person to take it. The refined version of the caution prediction then becomes that a person whose resources are just above the threshold requires a large, positive risk premium: there are some positive-average-return risks they will not take. The refined version of the desperation prediction is that a person whose resources are at rock bottom will accept a negative risk premium. They will take all positive-average-return risks with a potential payoff large enough to move them up the cliff; but also, many negative-average-return risks, as long as these too offer some chance of jumping up. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> illustrates this principle. The figure depicts a scenario where an individual is offered an option that will, with equal probability, yield either -100 resource units, or 100 + x resource units. We denote the risk premium with x. The risk premium converges to zero as resources pull away above the threshold. With resources just above the threshold, she needs a large positive risk premium to offset the chance of plunging below the threshold on the downside. Equivalently, she would readily pay for a safer option even if it had a lower average return. With resources just below the threshold, by contrast, she has to take risks with a negative premium, just because of the chance of returning above the threshold. She would thus be ready to pay for a riskier option, even one that will, on average, make her poorer. The 'risk premium', the minimum amount x that is required to make an option leading with equal probability to a payoff of -100 or (100 + x) resource units worth taking. We assume a DTM-compatible utility function combining a sigmoid function and a linear one:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">U(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x) + (x&gt;0)*x/50.</formula><p>The DTM also makes a testable prediction about variation in risk taking. Assume the utility function underlying figure 2, and imagine that people's resources vary randomly over time by up to a few hundred units. For an individual with a baseline of 2000 units of resources, these fluctuations would make absolutely no difference to which risks they were or were not prepared to take. For an individual with a baseline of 0 resource units, they would make a vast difference: with a small disturbance to their resource levels, they would go from fairly extreme risk avoidance to fairly extreme risk seeking. Thus, the model predicts that individuals whose resources are scarce should show greater intra-person temporal variability in their risk taking behaviour than individuals whose resources are abundant.</p><p>We can also state this prediction with regard to variation at the population level. Imagine that individuals vary a little in the exact position of their thresholds on the resource axis. For one person, +50 might be just above the threshold, but for another, +50 might be slightly below, because their needs and commitments are slightly different. If we are observing an affluent population all of whose resources are above 2000 units, this variation in threshold position has no consequences; such a population would be uniform in their risk behaviour. By contrast, a deprived population all of whose resources were +50 units would constitute a mixture of some people just above their thresholds and some people just below theirs. In such a population there would be a marked heterogeneity in risk taking. This leads to the variation prediction:</p><p>Variation prediction. Populations in conditions of resource scarcity should show greater variation in risk taking than those in conditions of resource abundance, whether variation is defined within individuals over time, or between individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Antecedents of the DTM</head><p>As noted, the DTM has arisen independently in several literatures, but these have remained siloed. Our presentation here aims to bring the different versions together in a common format. We see four literatures as flowing directly into the DTM (though see 6.1 and 6.4 for links to further literatures that explore similar constructs, such as basic needs, thresholds, and sigmoid functions).</p><p>One, from microeconomics, focuses on the fact that people sometimes seek and sometimes avoid risk: they simultaneously gamble and purchase insurance. The classic works literature introduced non-monotonic utility functions and 'aspiration levels' (thresholds) to explain this <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Diecidue &amp; Van De Ven, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Friedman &amp; Savage, 1948;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Robson, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Roy, 1952;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Simon, 1955)</ref>.</p><p>A second literature, from agricultural economics, is concerned with why subsistence farmers are risk averse and conservative in their farming choices, assuming that they aim to avoid falling below a 'disaster level' (i.e. the caution prediction) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Chayanov, 1926;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kunreuther &amp; Wright, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Masson, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Roumasset, 1971)</ref>. This literature has also explored the idea that when things get really bad, a 'reswitching' to risky strategies should occur (desperation prediction).</p><p>The third literature comes from development economics. It focuses on the situation of poverty, covering both the idea that when things are at rock bottom they cannot get any worse <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Banerjee, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Banerjee &amp; Newman, 1994)</ref>, and the idea that a small extra resource can have an outsized effect, by making escape from poverty possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Lybbert &amp; Barrett, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">, 2011</ref>.</p><p>Finally, an influential tradition of 'risk-sensitive foraging theory' began in animal behavioural ecology <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Caraco et al., 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Stephens, 1981)</ref>. The idea here is that starvation constitutes the ultimate threshold. When it is imminent, animals should take any level of risk to gain food (desperation prediction), whereas once it has been averted for the time being, they should avoid too much risk (caution prediction). This idea diffused from animal behavioural ecology into evolutionary anthropology and evolutionary psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Kuznar, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Mace &amp; Houston, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Mishra &amp; Lalumière, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Pietras &amp; Hackenberg, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Rode et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Winterhalder et al., 1999)</ref>.</p><p>Whilst we acknowledge that DTM ideas are widespread, we are keen to stress that the DTM is different from the status quo in models of human decision making. Most work in microeconomics assumes that utility functions are concave across all the ranges that matter for decision making, generating mild risk aversion. This is known as Gossen's first law <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Gossen, 1854)</ref>. The DTM is compatible with Gossen's first law across most of the resource spectrum; it merely adds that there is a convex segment brought about by the presence of a rock bottom, and that people find themselves in this segment often enough for it to matter. Utility functions that depart from Gossen's first law have been proposed multiple times, as mentioned above. But they have not been widely adopted in practice.</p><p>This may be in part for reasons of analytic convenience. Assuming concavity of the whole utility function is necessary to produce unique equilibria in models of agents interacting in markets. For example, it is a condition of the Arrow-Debreu model, which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a 'general equilibrium' in a perfectly competitive economy. Assuming concave utility functions preferences may be what Cherrier (2023) called a 'tractability trap', i.e. a modelling choice made for tractability purposes that is so convenient that it becomes entrenched in the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">The DTM and Prospect Theory</head><p>Readers may well be familiar with an existing model that features an S-shaped value function, and which predicts a combination of risk taking and risk aversion: Prospect Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref> The DTM is, however, quite different from Prospect Theory. The two approaches do not generally tackle the same questions or make the same predictions (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Houston et al., 2014)</ref>. They are not even the same kind of theory.</p><p>Prospect Theory is a descriptive psychological theory concerning how people evaluate risky options. It was developed to capture the ways in which people appear to depart from models of perfect rationality, notably expected utility theory. It has two main components: a probability weighting function, and a value function. The probability weighting function captures cognitive biases related to probabilities: people have been observed to overweight very unlikely outcomes, and underweight very likely ones (at least when scenarios are presented by description as opposed to by experience; <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Hertwig &amp; Erev, 2009)</ref>. The value function captures the fact that valuation of outcomes is asymmetric around a reference point. That reference point is usually taken to be the status quo. Thus, people evaluate the same material change differently if it represents a loss, as opposed to a gain, relative to what they already have. They are predicted to be more risk averse for gains than for equivalent losses.</p><p>The DTM does not assume imperfect rationality, nor that people depart from maximising expected utility. Rather, it models which decisions would maximise expected utility given a utility function a particular shape. It does not incorporate any biases in estimating probabilities or any difference between losses and gains relative to the status quo. Under the DTM, what should drive decisions under risk is whereabouts in the resources-utility space the various possible outcomes would leave the person. Whether these outcomes represent a loss or a gain relative to the status quo is not considered. Prospect Theory-type departures from perfect rationality could also occur, but they would be deviations from the rational pattern predicted by the DTM.  designed experiments in which the predictions of the DTM and those of Prospect Theory could be tested simultaneously. Participants chose between risky and riskless options to gain resources. There were two cross-factored independent variables: participants currently had (or did not have) a minimum level of resources that they needed; and the options were framed in terms of losses (or gains). The results showed both DTM and Prospect Theory effects. People chose risk more often when they were going to fall short of what they needed (the DTM's desperation prediction). They were also, collapsing across positions relative to need, more likely to choose risk when the framing was in terms of losses than gains (the Prospect Theory prediction). The need-based effect size was however considerably larger (see their figures 1 and 3). (See also Zeisberger (2022) for other evidence that people are often concerned about the probability of meeting some aspiration level in ways that are not captured by Prospect Theory). Thus, the DTM and Prospect Theory predict and explain different types of phenomena, both of which may occur.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Empirical evidence</head><p>In this section, we review the empirical evidence relevant to the DTM's predictions. We classify the sources of evidence into four major groups, which vary on the two dimensions of causal identification and external validity (figure 3). Laboratory experiments are high in causal identification and low in external validity (section 3.1); observational studies of artificial lottery choices are low in both (section 3.2); observational studies of real-world decisions are low in causal identification but high in external validity (section 3.3); and natural experiments are (fairly) high in both causal identification and external validity (section 3.4). This typology over-simplifies. For example, some of the natural experiment studies (3.4) use artificial lottery choices, but we place them in their own quadrant because of their stronger causal design. Our review is non-systematic; the relevant literature is so diverse as to preclude systematic review and meta-analysis. Although we have included non-supportive findings where we have encountered them, our informal search strategy will tend to bias us towards including instances that fit the narrative. Thus, the reader should consider this section as providing a guide to the diversity of evidence that can be interpreted within the framework of the DTM, not a strong falsification test. We have counted evidence as relevant where there is some test of: the desperation prediction; the desperation prediction and caution prediction jointly; or the variation prediction. A test of the caution prediction alone would not feature the DTM's hallmark feature, namely switching to risk taking at very low levels of resources.</p><p>Section 3 only covers evidence from humans. There are also literatures that test versions of the DTM in birds (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Kacelnik &amp; Bateson, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Kacelnik &amp; El Mouden, 2013</ref> for reviews), bees <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cartar, 1991)</ref>, and even plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Dener et al., 2016)</ref>. We refer readers to those papers for further information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Laboratory experiments</head><p>Experimental tests of DTM predictions began when researchers wondered whether ideas about risk-sensitive foraging in animals were relevant to humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Pietras &amp; Hackenberg, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Rode et al., 1999)</ref>. The varied paradigms that have been used <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">(Table 1)</ref> share some core features. The researcher creates an experimental currency (e.g. points or cents). An exogenous threshold level of this currency is defined, below which a negative consequence occurs (e.g. a cash payment at the end of the experiment is lost). The participant chooses between options that produce payoffs in the experimental currency and differ in their level of risk. The general finding is that participants are more likely to choose the risky option when they are not currently on target to meet the threshold requirement. Most experiments show switching from risk avoidance to risk taking within subjects, thus ruling out explanations in terms of stable dispositions. The consistency of the findings is extremely high, and the effect sizes are substantial.</p><p>Most of the studies involve impersonal 'games against nature', but a subset introduces a social element. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Pietras et al. (2006)</ref>, the less risky option was to share resources with another participant. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Radkani et al. (2023)</ref>, the riskiest option was to steal points from other participants, with the possibility of being caught and fined. Thus, the results were a test of the DTM's ability to explain desperation-driven crime, or breakdown of cooperation.</p><p>In creating <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, we excluded a number of adjacent papers that appeal to the DTM but differ methodologically from studies shown. We only included experiments in which participants made choices that could increase their (at least hypothetical) resource levels, ruling out a studies using DTM logic to investigate completely abstract or non-self-interested decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Mishra &amp; Fiddick, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Wang, 2002)</ref>. The choices on offer had to differ in risk for amount of payoff. This excluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Pietras et al. (2003)</ref>, where the options differed in their risk for temporal delay, rather than resource amount. It is also meant excluding several experiments such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Rode et al. (1999)</ref>, where the critical choice is between options whose riskiness is known and options whose riskiness is unknown. They found that people will accept options with unknown risk more readily when their resources are below a desperation threshold. Assuming that an unknown risk feels, from a psychological point of view, like a large risk, this finding is closely related to the desperation prediction. Finally, we excluded studies where the manipulation is purely status relative to another individual, rather than level of resources in some currency <ref type="bibr">(Mishra et al., 2014)</ref>. The DTM can be extended to explain effects of relative social status on risk-taking by assuming that 'doing as well as competitors' constitutes a basic need. However, this is an extension of the DTM rather than a test of the basic version <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Deditius-Island et al. (2007)</ref> is marginal under this criterion, but we opted to include it).</p><p>Whilst the results of the experimental studies are unanimous, the obvious limitations concern external validity. The experiments demonstrate that people are able to adjust their decisions as predicted when they are given, in a contrived scenario, an explicit threshold, a reason for meeting it, and a set of well-defined choices differing in risk. This is not the same as showing that their decisions outside the laboratory are driven by those same principles. Nonetheless, it is impressive how clearly, consistently and accurately the participants adjust their risk taking to their probability of meeting the threshold. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Artificial choice tasks in relation to real-world resources</head><p>This section concerns observational studies that use participants' real-world resources (e.g. income or wealth) to predict their choices on artificial dilemmas involving risk <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>. The dilemmas are typically expressed as choices between lotteries, such as 'Would you prefer $100 for certain, or a 50% chance of getting zero and a 50% chance of getting $200?'. The currency of the payoffs and the size of the stakes varies. In some studies, the lotteries are paid out; in others, hypothetical.</p><p>We excluded studies that aim to establish whether people in a certain population are risk averse on average, and those that test only for monotonic relationships between resources and risk taking. Such studies are numerous, both of large datasets from mostly high-income countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Dohmen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Donkers et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Eckel et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Guiso &amp; Paiella, 2008)</ref> and smaller samples from rural subsistence contexts (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Miyata, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Wik et al., 2004)</ref>. The typical finding is that risk taking increases with income and wealth, supporting the caution prediction. However, since the distinctive prediction of the DTM is the desperation prediction, the minimum criterion for inclusion in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> was either a comparison of individuals who could not meet their basic needs with individuals who could, or some kind of test for non-monotonicity.</p><p>The studies in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref> all find some evidence for the desperation prediction. One <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(de Courson et al., 2025)</ref> also tested the variation prediction. The populations studied range from farmers and herders for whom starvation is a serious possibility, through to people in contemporary France, the UK and USA, where this is presumably not the case. Some of the studies defined what the threshold point should be a priori. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Caballero (2010)</ref> calculated what income would be needed in Bogota to avoid malnourishment. Others used the data to identify an inflection point, for example by using curvilinear or broken-stick regression. Some studies used subjective rather than objective resources variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(de Courson et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Tucker, 2012)</ref>. That is, rather than measuring material assets as the predictor, they used the participants' appraisals of whether they had enough to meet their basic needs.</p><p>Though the predictor variable in these studies is ecologically valid, the outcome variable is not spontaneous decision-making. Where the dilemmas are incentivized, the stakes are necessarily small or moderate (up to a few days' wages). The studies that have deliberately made the stakes large enough to have lifechanging consequences have, unsurprisingly, used hypothetical incentives. <ref type="bibr">Kahneman &amp; Tversky (1979, p. 265)</ref> defend the use of hypothetical dilemmas for such problems, given the ethical and practical impossibility of making such stakes real, and on the basis that it is reasonable to assume that people know how they would behave, and have no special reason to disguise their inclinations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Holt &amp; Laury (2002)</ref> show that choices in incentivized and hypothetical risk dilemmas follow a similar pattern, although as the stakes increase, people become more risk averse for the incentivized case than the hypothetical one. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Real-world choices in relation to real-world resources</head><p>This section reviews observational studies of real-world decisions between alternatives that differ in risk, in relation to real-world resource levels (income or wealth). We opt for a narrative approach rather than a table, and concentrate on two sets of studies: of subsistence strategies (3.3.1), and of acquisitive crime (section 3.3.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1">Subsistence strategies</head><p>Subsistence strategies are a suitable domain in which to test the DTM's predictions. Resource levels can be well quantified, for example using acreage or herd size. Producers constantly have to decide between different options, for instance between consumption crops and cash crops <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Kunreuther &amp; Wright, 1974)</ref>, or between drought-resistant camels and drought-susceptible goats <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Mace, 1990)</ref>. These options vary in risk in ways that can be estimated empirically from available data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kunreuther &amp; Wright (1974)</ref> examined the behaviour of farmers in 20th century Bangladesh and the 19th century US South. In both cases, the farmers had to choose between a consumption crop (rice/corn) and a crop for cash sale (jute/cotton). Those choosing the cash crop would mostly use the cash to buy the consumption crop at market. Producing the cash crop is riskier due to the vagaries of market prices: the year-to-year standard deviation in the amount of food a farmer could end up with was 2-3 times higher (Bangladesh) or 4-5 times higher (US South) if they chose to plant the cash crop. On the other hand, the mean amount was also often higher. In both locations, those with large farms planted a greater proportion of their fields with cash crops than those with moderate-sized farms (caution prediction). However, among the very smallest farms, the trend reversed, and the farmers went for a high proportion of cash crops (desperation prediction). Kunreuther and Wright commented 'one possible explanation would be that the farmer… prefers to gamble to avoid poverty' (p. 3).</p><p>Mace <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Mace, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Mace &amp; Houston, 1989</ref>) studied the choice by African herders to keep sheep and goats versus camels. Camels can better tolerate drought conditions, and hence are less risky, but less profitable. In a theoretical model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Mace &amp; Houston (1989)</ref> showed that very poor households should keep only sheep and goats, to get their herds to a critical size. Above this size, they should switch mainly to safer camels. This prediction was clearly supported in three groups studied, and ambiguous in a fourth. Households with a small herd kept exclusively sheep and goats (desperation prediction), whilst households with large herds kept mostly camels (caution prediction).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Property crime</head><p>Property crime as a high-risk way of gaining resources compared to legitimate economic activity. It necessarily involves the risk of being caught and punished, not to mention the payoffs being highly variable for other reasons. Making risky choices in artificial risk dilemmas predicts criminal behaviour in young men, even after controlling for other factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Epper et al., 2022)</ref>. The DTM thus predicts an increased probability of turning to acquisitive crime when resources are extremely low (desperation prediction). There is some criminological evidence compatible with this prediction (which was tested experimentally by <ref type="bibr" target="#b117">Radkani et al. (2023)</ref>, see 3.1).</p><p>McCarthy &amp; Hagan <ref type="bibr">(1992)</ref> found that the best predictor of theft among homeless Canadian youth was hunger. Property crime rates are higher in poor neighbourhoods <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Patterson, 1991)</ref> and in periods of high unemployment <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Levitt, 2001)</ref>. Extremely disadvantaged neighbourhoods, where desperation is presumably more frequent, display 'unusually high rates of crimes' <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Krivo &amp; Peterson, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">Wilson, 2012)</ref>, even though most individuals there avoid crime. In a study of bank robbers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Camp (1968)</ref> explicitly explained the robberies by a "nothing to lose" feeling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">Shover (1996)</ref>, in a study of individuals who committed theft that, 'all their lives most have been poor or just a financial crisis and a few paychecks away from it' (p. 30). <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Jacobs &amp; Wright (1999)</ref> reported that 'with few exceptions, the decision to commit a robbery arises in the face of…..a pressing need for fast cash' (p. 153), often linked to their ability to secure basic necessities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Rossmo &amp; Summers (2022)</ref> found that many respondents distinguished offending based on 'wants' from offending based on 'needs'. The authors coined the concept of 'quantum jumps' in subjective utility, close to our notion of a threshold, which can trigger offending: '[the person] needs a specific amount of money such that anything less has limited value; for example…a debt with an impending payment due or [the requirement to] come up with the rent in order to avoid eviction. For these individuals, it is a matter of all or nothing' (p.7).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Natural experiments</head><p>This section deals with cases with studies where there is some shock to, or exogenous driver of, resource levels. This allows researchers to measure subsequent variation in risk taking with moderate confidence that changes in resource levels are the causal factor. The strength of these studies is that many thirdvariable and reverse causality explanations can be ruled out. There are two kinds of relevant study: resource shock studies, and resource cycle studies.</p><p>Resource shock studies examine the consequences of exposure to natural disasters or civil upheaval for risk taking, usually measured with artificial risk dilemmas. These studies find sometimes that exposure increases risk taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Eckel et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Hanaoka et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Kettlewell et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Page et al., 2014)</ref>, and sometimes that it decreases it <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Callen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Cassar et al., 2017)</ref>. Many of these studies are difficult to relate directly to the DTM. Their independent variable is some measure of exposure to the shock. The researchers are mostly interested in identifying the psychological impact of exposure, but it is not clear whether or how the respondents' objective resource levels were altered, or whether they have been restored by the time of study. An exception is the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Page et al. (2014)</ref>, who studied an Australian flood. They examined risk taking by homeowners with large property losses compared to neighbours whose houses happened to be a little way above the waterline. The homeowners with losses took more risk in a gambling task, and the worse the losses, the more likely they were to choose the risky options.</p><p>Resource cycle studies use exogenous temporal variation in resource levels to identify their causal impact. The classic example is the welfare check cycle: in jurisdictions where welfare payments are made around the 1st of the month, the day of the calendar month serves as an instrumental variable for people's current resource levels. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Foley (2011)</ref> found that acquisitive crimes in US cities follow 'welfare payment cycles', with an increase in the rates over the course of the month as welfare payments run out. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akesaka et al. (2023)</ref> studied artificial risk dilemmas in American and Japanese participants who depended on a monthly payout. In both cases, risk taking increased in the period leading to the pay day. An oddity of these results is that the gambles had lifetime consequences and extremely large stakes. If the actual resource shortfall is a minor one that will only last a few days, it is not clear why, under strict rationality, preferences for long-term decisions ought to change. The best interpretation here is that falling short of a need level induces a risk taking mindset, which then gets applied both to decisions that are strategically appropriate to solving the problem, and to decisions that are not. We note also that <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Carvalho et al. (2016)</ref> did not find any difference in weakly-incentivized lottery risk taking before versus after payday in two panels of relatively low-income US adults.</p><p>In the context of the DTM, many of these studies suffer from a problem of prediction specificity: what does the model actually predict? The DTM predicts a nonmonotonic mapping of risk taking to resources. A negative shock could thus either increase or decrease risk taking, depending on where in relation to the threshold the person started out, and the magnitude of the shock. At least one of these is usually unknown. The fact that resource shock studies sometimes find increases in risk taking and sometimes decreases makes sense in the context of the DTM, but it causes an epistemological problem. If both an increase or a decrease in risk taking could be counted as support for the DTM, then how could the DTM ever be falsified? We return to this question in section 5.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Summary of section 3</head><p>Section 3 has reviewed a wide range of evidence that can be marshalled in support of the DTM as a useful middle-level idealization. Of particular note is the variety of methodologies-from psychological experiments to agricultural history-and settings-from high-income countries to subsistence farmers and herders-that ae represented. The ability to integrate a wide variety of evidence from different contexts under a common explanatory framework is the hallmark of a useful and generative middle-level theory. As such, section 3 suggests that the DTM is not just a potentially fruitful paradigm, but, under its various different names, an already fruitful one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Population implications</head><p>The DTM is a model of individual decision making, but it can be used to predict and interpret patterns at the levels of populations and societies. Thus, it has potential to contribute to solving the 'micro-macro' problem in social science. This is the challenge of linking individual-level actions and decisions to broader societal patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Coleman, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Elster, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Epstein, 2012)</ref>. Inference between the DTM and population-level patterns is potentially bidirectional. On the one hand, one can assume the DTM is true at the individual level in order to make predictions about regularities at the societal level (De Courson &amp; Nettle, 2021; see 4.1). On the other hand, patterns observed at the societal level can provide evidence that the DTM is a realistic model of how the individuals in those societies are making decisions (see 4.2). This seems rather circular: we assume that the DTM is true in order to understand macro-patterns, and use macro-patterns as evidence that the DTM is true. In fact, this is just an example of 'inference to the best explanation' <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Lipton, 2017)</ref>. The more varied the phenomena that turn out to be concordant with the DTM, the stronger the case that it is a useful idealization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Explaining associations between inequality and aggregate outcomes</head><p>Many studies have detected correlations, across cities, countries or states, between the inequality of the income or wealth distribution (as measured with the Gini index), and aggregate outcome variables such as average life satisfaction, average health, crime rate, or average social trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barone &amp; Mocetti, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Kelly, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Rufrancos et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Wilkinson &amp; Pickett, 2009)</ref>. This has led to considerable debate about causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Daly, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Lynch et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Pickett &amp; Wilkinson, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Sommet et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Truesdale &amp; Jencks, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Vilalta et al., 2024)</ref>. The Gini index is an abstract population statistic. It is unclear by what causal pathway it could affect the health, emotions or decisions of individual people.</p><p>One simple way that greater inequality in the resource distribution can affect aggregate outcomes is if the mapping between resources and outcomes at the individual level is non-linear. For example, imagine that the probability of committing an acquisitive crime rises sharply when individuals have less than $1000, and is a flat line for all incomes greater than that. If the income distribution is made more unequal (keeping its mean in the same place), then more people than before will have less than $1000, and their probability of committing crimes will go up. There will also be people who have got richer by a corresponding amount, but their probability of committing crimes won't go down, because the resources-crime function is flat at the higher end. So, the people who are made worse off will commit more crimes, and the people who are made better off will not commit any fewer. The total amount of crime goes up. This is known as a concavity effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Gravelle, 1998)</ref>. Due to the non-linear mapping at the individual level, the aggregate outcome is affected by changes in not just the mean, but also the variance, of the resource distribution.</p><p>Because the DTM predicts a non-linear mapping between individual resources and decisions, it implies that concavity effects will be widespread, and thus that inequality will often matter (statistically) for aggregate outcomes. Concavity effects follow by mathematical necessity. They do not rely on the people in the population having any particular reaction to inequality per se, or even perceiving it. Much of the debate in the inequality literature concerns whether concavity effects are sufficient to explain associations between inequality and aggregate outcomes, or whether other processes must also be at work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bellet &amp; Colson-Sihra, 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Kelley &amp; Evans, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Nettle &amp; Dickins, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Sommet &amp; Elliot, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>It may be helpful in this context to distinguish between primary effects of concavity, and secondary effects, which are due to people responding to the primary effects. De  argued that greater acquisitive crime is a primary effect of increased desperation as inequality becomes larger; it is committed largely by individuals who find themselves below the desperation threshold. Decreased social trust and increased violent crime may be secondary effects. People find themselves in a population in which others may try to steal from them. Hence, they trust less; and they may also need to use violence as a toughness signal, to avoid being the target of stealing. Secondary effects need not be restricted to individuals who are below the desperation threshold. In a population in which more people are desperate, the lower trust would become general through interaction.</p><p>If associations between inequality and aggregate outcomes are driven by concavity effects and their secondary consequences, then there is a sense in which inequality is not the real causal variable. The real causal variable is the fraction of people who are below the threshold (De Courson and Nettle 2021). Across many scenarios, the Gini and the fraction of people who are below the threshold are perfectly correlated. However, there are thought experiments in which the two are decoupled. For example, the DTM predicts that in a society so rich or so well institutionally protected that every individual's basic needs were guaranteed always to be met, the Gini coefficient should cease to predict aggregate outcomes. A second thought experiment is that in a society where almost everyone's resources were below the threshold, the DTM predicts that increasing inequality could improve aggregate outcomes. This would be because broadening the dispersion would put some individuals into above-threshold positions, whilst the bulk of people, already being below the threshold, cannot be made much worse off than they already are.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Impact of welfare states on risky behaviours</head><p>Economically advanced countries have welfare states that function to boost low incomes, and prevent them ever becoming critically low. In principle, in a perfectly effective welfare state, there would be no fear of falling below the threshold, and zero incidence of actually doing so. This means we should not observe either the extreme caution characteristic of people just above, nor the desperate risk taking of people below, in a society with such a system.</p><p>A few cross-national studies have examined the effect of welfare provision on risk taking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bird (2001)</ref> showed that where there is a more generous welfare provision, people take on economic activities with more variable income streams, such as entrepreneurship. Likewise, <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Iversen &amp; Soskice (2001)</ref> found that in countries where people take on more training for highly specialised trades, there is higher public support for welfare provision. The researchers argue that trade specialisation is a risky investment, so where it is common, people want insurance against the downsides. The direction of causality cannot be unambiguously identified in these studies: it could be that where people's incomes are more variable, they vote for welfare expansion; or where there is good welfare, they take on risky jobs. Schroyen &amp; Aarbu (2018) compared risky choices, measured using artificial risk dilemmas, across six countries. People in countries with more extensive welfare provision chose more risky options. In DTM terms, this can be interpreted as a reduction in abovethreshold caution that comes from knowledge that there is an effective safety net.</p><p>If the welfare state effectively prevents people from falling below the threshold, then better welfare prediction should reduce crime. The hypothesis that welfare provision suppresses crime is over 125 years old, with Franz von Liszt describing social policy as 'the best and most effective crime policy' in 1898 (cited in <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Rudolph &amp; Starke, 2020)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Rudolph &amp; Starke (2020)</ref> reviewed 41 cross-national studies testing the hypothesis that more generous welfare provision is associated with lower crime rates. Thirty-two studies, plus the original study they present, found support for the hypothesis. In their own data, the strongest welfare-provision predictor of a lower crime rate (operationalised as homicide rate) was the generosity of unemployment insurance. They argue that unemployment insurance insulates people from the extreme strain of loss of livelihood. Relatedly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Calnitsky &amp; Gonalons-Pons (2021)</ref> found that, in an experimental trial of a guaranteed basic income scheme (the Manitoba Basic Annual Income Experiment), the intervention reduced both property crime and violent crime.</p><p>In summary, correlates of more generous welfare provision appear to include both increased risk taking (for socially benign risks such as choice of profession), and decreased extreme risk taking (such as property and violent crime). The DTM provides micro-foundations through which these two seemingly contrary effects could both occur.

Implicitly, this argument is based on expected utility: if individuals balance costs and benefits, authorities could prevent crime by imposing sanctions harsh enough to make the payoff negative on average <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Becker, 1968)</ref>. Making the punishment more severe may be easier and cheaper than increasing the probability of punishment, and should be have the same effect (since expected utility is the product of probability and magnitude). However, in empirical studies, there is little evidence that increasing punishment severity has a negative effect on crime rates, while increasing the probability of sanction does <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barnum &amp; Nagin, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Dölling et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Nagin, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The DTM can potentially explain why increasing severity is apparently not deterrent (whilst improving welfare provision is, see 4.2). Assuming that much crime is committed by individuals with below-threshold resources, the perpetrators are typically at or close to rock bottom. A larger punishment then has no greater effect on them than a smaller one. What matters is that the deviant act gives them some probability of moving back above the threshold. A formal model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">de Courson &amp; Nettle (2021)</ref>, based on the DTM, predicted that increasing punishment severity beyond a minimal level would not reduce property crime, since this was only ever committed (under the assumptions of their model) by people already at rock bottom anyway. The model even predicted some circumstances in which more severe punishment could make property crime more prevalent: very severe punishments push temporarily desperate individuals even further into desperation, hence in the direction of subsequent crime. This prediction -of increasing punishment severity sometimes being not just ineffective but counterproductive -was made independently in a theoretical paper using similar assumptions (MacLeod, 2023).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Critical issues</head><p>In our presentation thus far, we have left some important conceptual and epistemological issues unaddressed. Resolving these is important for identifying the predictions of the model more precisely, and ascertaining its scientific value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Is the threshold a subjective or objective construct?</head><p>Should the input variable to the DTM -the level of resources -be operationalised in objective material terms (e.g. a number of dollars or calories) or subjective psychological ones (a feeling of basic needs being met)? Our answer to this question is both. The subjective feeling that needs are, or are not, being met should be a strong proximal determinant of risk orientation. However, we would expect objective resource availability, in turn, to influence these subjective feelings. Hence the DTM is still relevant to people who want to study the consequences of changes in objective economic resources and their distribution.</p><p>The effect of changing material resources should be mediated by changes in subjective feelings. In a straightforward comparison, the subjective variables should often be the stronger predictors, for several reasons. They are closer in the causal chain. Different people need different levels of objective resources to achieve the same level of security, so objective incomes are noisy measures. People are presumably good at taking a 'read' of their situation, and so subjective measures do not suffer this noise. Empirically, subjective appraisal variables outperform objective indicators as predictors in many domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Idler &amp; Benyamini, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Kaiser &amp; Oswald, 2022)</ref>. In the DTM context, de  used both a subjective resource adequacy measure and an objective measure of household income to predict risky choice. The hallmark DTM pattern of risk avoidance at low resource levels, and risk taking at very low resource levels, was more clearly supported with the subjective appraisal measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Is the threshold level absolute or relative?</head><p>Another question is whether the threshold level is absolute or relative, that is, to what extent its position depends on others' levels of resources. Both perspectives are defensible. Hunger does not intrinsically depend on what other people have to eat. On the other hand, what is considered a basic need clearly varies over time and space, depending on what it is normal to have in a society: as Marx (1849) observed, "let there arise next to the little house a palace, and the little house shrinks to a hut" (p. 16).</p><p>We leave this question somewhat open, but we are unattracted by either extreme position. A purely absolute conception of threshold level is clearly problematic. The threshold of desperation is a level of material resources that allows people to satisfy the basic needs constituted both by their physiology (which are largely absolute), and by the expectations and social roles available in the broader society (which must have a relative component). We have already mentioned (2.2) Adam Smith's observation that necessities include whatever it is "indecent for creditable people to be without". This is necessarily society-relative.</p><p>On the other hand, if the position of the threshold were purely relative, then uniform increase in society's wealth (affecting all percentiles of the distribution in the same way) would have no impact on the prevalence of desperation. Yet there have been directional historical reductions in many important risk-related behaviours, such as violence, as societies have become more affluent <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baumard, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Pinker, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Thome, 2007)</ref>. We are interested in using the DTM to understand these changes. It is a reasonable assertion that the overall growth in society's wealth has generally decreased the amount of desperation.</p><p>We favour a hybrid position. As people's individual incomes increase, their idea of the level of income necessary to meet basic needs also increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Castro &amp; Bleys, 2023)</ref>. But it only increases about half as fast as their incomes. Thus, as they get richer, their individual subjective threshold rises, but they also (on average) perceive themselves to be further from it. We suspect something similar can happen at the societal level. As the people around us obtain more, our notion of what is indecent to be without does change, but not necessarily at the same rate. Thus, there is scope for the prevalence of desperation to differ sharply across place and time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3">Is the DTM falsifiable?</head><p>In many datasets, it is hard to know a priori where on the resource scale the cliff and the rock bottom are located. This makes the DTM able to accommodate a variety of results without being clearly falsified. If the observed association between resources and risk taking is linear and negative, we could conclude that the DTM is supported, but there are no desperate individuals in the sample. If the association is U-shaped, we would definitely conclude that the DTM is supported. There can also be an apparent circularity: we identify those individuals who are below the threshold because they take risks, and also explain that risk taking by the fact they are below the threshold. Thus, the model could be accused of being so permissive and hermetic that it is essentially unfalsifiable.</p><p>We defend the DTM against this charge. In general, middle-range theories are not falsifiable by any individual study <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Ketelaar &amp; Ellis, 2000)</ref>. Rather, they are justified by their ability to create clear predictions and new understanding across a range of different studies. More concretely, the falsifiability criticism above applies mainly to observational studies relating some measure of objective resources to some measure of risk taking. Even for these studies, there are many patterns that would falsify DTM predictions, for example no association; or an inverted U-shape with the highest risk taking in the middle of the resource distribution. More importantly, studies of this type form only one part of the evidence (section 3). Studies that use subjective appraisals make stronger predictions: a switch to risk taking around the point where the participants feel unable to meet their basic needs. The experimental studies are also important, despite the ecological validity concerns, because the predictions are unambiguous and the causality clear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">An agenda for DTM research</head><p>In this final, non-exhaustive section, we outline possible areas for the growth of future research inspired by the DTM.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Proximal representations: thresholds in the mind</head><p>The DTM posits that people's utility functions have a particular shape (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1A)</ref>. This could be taken in an 'as if' sense: people behave 'as if' their decisions were driven by maximisation of such a function. But there must be underlying cognitive computations or heuristics that deliver the predicted pattern of choices. Two literatures we are aware of have attempted to directly measure the shape of utility functions in the mind. Interestingly, they both posit sigmoid functions resembling <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">figure 1A</ref>.</p><p>The first, the individual welfare function literature of the 1970s and 1980s, used survey data in which respondents stated what levels of income they would consider 'very bad <ref type="bibr">', 'bad'...'good', or 'excellent' (Kapteyn &amp; Wansbeek, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Van Praag, 1971</ref>). The 'very bad' income level was assumed to carry a utility of zero, and the 'excellent' a utility of one; the income values given for the other descriptors were used to estimate the shape of the function across the interval in between. The resulting function was sigmoid, but this was largely due to the assumptions made. Moreover, a logarithmic function, which would satisfy Gossen's first law but not the DTM, fitted the data almost as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Van Herwaarden &amp; Kapteyn, 1981)</ref>. In short, this paradigm was hampered by a number of assumptions (such as that a 'very bad' income is the worst possible income someone could imagine) and limitations (such as fitting non-linear functions to just nine points per respondent). We do however feel that the objective was important and that the limitations could be addressed in future research.</p><p>The second literature comes from neuroscience, where researchers have estimated the shape of utility functions for sweet juice in monkeys <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Genest et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Stauffer et al., 2014)</ref>. The functions are sigmoid, and the magnitude of response to reward cues in midbrain dopamine neurons reflects this. The paradigm uses choices under risk to infer the shape of the function. In other words, the researchers used the fact that the monkeys are risk prone for small rewards and risk averse for large ones to back out the sigmoid shape, rather than observing the sigmoid shape first and then predicting risky choices from it. Nonetheless, we would like to see this approach extended to humans and the reward domain of income or wealth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">The connection to wellbeing and poverty research</head><p>There is considerable epidemiological research associating measures of subjective wellbeing and mental health to levels of actual financial resources (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Nettle et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Nettle &amp; Dickins, 2022</ref>). Whether we should expect these associations to be sigmoid (indeed, whether the DTM predicts that they should be) depends on the extent to which we see subjective wellbeing (or mental health) measures as capturing the same thing as utility.</p><p>All accounts of the resources-wellbeing mapping feature the cliff, because they all include diminishing marginal returns, usually by assuming a logarithmic relationship. However, wellbeing research has not, to our knowledge, demonstrated the existence of rock bottom. This may in part be due to methodological choices: fitting a monotonic function, such as a logarithmic one, precludes the detection of non-monotonic mappings. Alternatives such as 'broken-stick' regression (as used in de Courson et al., 2025) would allow the investigation of non-monotonicity.</p><p>Another relevant literature links financial resources to material deprivation. A material deprivation is the inability, for financial reasons, to achieve a key objective. Examples are: keeping one's home warm; having adequate and substantial meals; replacing worn-out furniture; buying new clothes; and being able to meet friends and family at least once a month. These objectives are chosen so as to represent 'the goods and services necessary to lead a decent life' <ref type="bibr">(Blasco, 2023, p. 7)</ref>. As such they correspond closely to the notion of basic needs we developed in section 2.2.</p><p>In affluent countries, the relationship between income and the number of material deprivations is typically non-linear, with three regimes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Blasco, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Between the lowest income and around half the country median, the relationship between income and the number of deprivations is a flat line. Between around 0.5 and 1.5 times the median income, there is a steep negative relationship; each increment of extra income reduces the number of deprivations. Above 1.5 times median income, there is again a flat line, because the number of deprivations is zero.</p><p>This looks like what the DTM requires: at rock bottom, small increments in income are insufficient to make any difference to deprivations; around the cliff level, extra resources rapidly reduce deprivations; and this flattens off once all deprivations are gone. However, the interpretation of the pattern by Blasco (2023) is more methodological than substantive. He argues that the flat relationship between income and deprivations below 0.5 times the median income is that people with incomes this low are very heterogeneous. Some may be living off capital or support from family. Thus, the incomes people report in this bottom part of the distribution are simply a poor guide to their actual resources, rather than any deeper discovery about rock bottom. Nonetheless, we view material deprivations and their relationships to resources as an area for future DTM-inspired research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Moral and ethical thought</head><p>There is a cluster of moral and ethical questions, some of them empirical, some normative, concerning basic needs and distributive justice. We believe these connect to the DTM, and in some cases tacitly assume the DTM utility function pattern, but we would like to see the connections explored explicitly.</p><p>Empirically, participants sometimes find distribution on the basis of effort or merit to be morally just (even if this leads to inequality), and sometimes find unconditional distribution of resources to all group members to be morally required <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Nettle &amp; Saxe, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Starmans et al., 2017)</ref>. The difference-maker between these two cases may be whether the putative recipients are perceived as being above or below a basic needs cliff. The psychology of sharing is highly sensitive to cues of need <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Lightner et al., 2023)</ref>. Relatedly, participants tend to have 'quasi-maximin' preferences for social distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Kameda et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Nettle et al., 2023)</ref>. That is, they place great weight on how good or bad the distribution is for the worst-off participants. This implies, in effect, that there are representations of others' need functions, and of a threshold, available during moral computation.</p><p>Notions of cliffs and thresholds also crop up in normative reasoning. The philosophical position of sufficientarianism holds that justice requires that everyone has 'enough' <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Frankfurt, 2018)</ref>. This requires a definition of 'enough', and a threshold where 'enough' has been reached <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Timmer, 2022)</ref>. Many political philosophers have argued that society should protect people from being unable to meet their basic needs through no fault of their own. The grounds for this requirement are varied: the utilitarian (being below the threshold is disproportionately unpleasant, and so eliminating this possibility is an efficient way of increasing aggregate wellbeing; <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Singer, 2009)</ref>; the contractarian (if people decided on a social order under a veil of ignorance about what position in society they would occupy, they would prefer one in which there was no chance they would find themselves below the threshold; <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Rawls, 1971)</ref>; and the liberal (people below the threshold are vulnerable to arbitrary domination by other people, so ensuring no-one is in the position maximises freedom; Pettit, 2014). All versions tacitly require that something like the DTM pattern exists: that there is a level of resources it is disastrous to be without, so that attaining and maintaining this level has a moral priority over other kinds of claim (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Wiggins, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>In modern states, the welfare system is the set of institutions that addresses the moral claims of need. Although normative justifications for welfare systems vary, it is often said that they should 'put a floor under people's feet' or 'protect people from the worst outcomes'. In more explicitly DTM terms, we could see welfare systems as (ideally) insulating people from any danger of falling down the cliff, and hence removing any need for them to ever be excessively risk averse, or irresponsibly risk prone (see 4.2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.4">Sociopolitical implications</head><p>Societies generate 'moral orders', sets of stable expectations about what resources people will be entitled to. A long-standing puzzle in social science is the fact that people who are relatively disadvantaged by these moral orders often nonetheless comply with them, and even justify them <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Jost et al., 2004)</ref>. On the other hand, moral orders can collapse quite rapidly in episodes of social flux and rebellion. Predicting these episodes is difficult, and is the topic of longstanding enquiry (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Gurr, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Turchin et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>The DTM may shed some light on the combination of frequent compliance and occasional rebellion. If a moral order provides people a very high probability of meeting basic needs, the DTM predicts risk aversion. People who are currently above the threshold will prefer a fairly bad status quo to the huge risk involved in a rebellion (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Theriault et al., 2021)</ref>. However, once the moral order fails to satisfy the basic needs of enough people (or seems likely to do so in the near future) then the DTM predicts a widespread turn to risk taking (for relevant evidence, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Humphreys &amp; Weinstein, 2008)</ref>. Rapid social flux then becomes more probable.</p><p>Political elites can predict that the populace will remain more or less compliant as long as their basic needs are met. Indeed, elites have an incentive to maintain the populace just above the threshold, where they are maximally risk averse. We should expect elites to put in place institutions just generous enough to allow most people to guarantee basic needs, but not more generous. This implies that societies may exhibit 'self-organised criticality' <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bak et al., 1988)</ref>: they will spend most of their time close to a tipping point, where a relatively small subsistence shock could lead to sociopolitical upheaval.</p><p>A case study comes from the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Scott (1977)</ref> on peasants in Southeast Asia, who considered their ability to secure their subsistence as their central "moral claim" (p.32). Their criterion of justice was not whether the share of profit taken by the ruling class was reasonable, but rather, "does this institution…provide me with a living regardless of what the land may yield this season?" (p.44). They therefore preferred their rent to be proportional to yearly production, rather than a fixed amount, as this eliminates the risk of an unpayable rent liability. Landlords were also pragmatic, postponing taxes in bad years. Colonial powers failed to appreciate the delicate balance of the moral order, imposing uniform and unyielding taxes that put people at risk of falling below the threshold. For Scott, this explained the unforeseen explosion of political violence in <ref type="bibr">Vietnam and</ref><ref type="bibr">Burma in 1930-1931</ref>. Thus, the DTM may provide a useful vocabulary for work in comparative anthropology and political economy that examines moral orders, stability, and rebellion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion</head><p>We have introduced the DTM, an idealised model of resource-dependent decision making that assumes individuals have a rock bottom in their utility functions, and a steep cliff around the point where they can satisfy their basic needs. The DTM makes predictions about what types of risk people will take, and when. It provides a principled understanding of why poverty, compared to affluence, would be associated both with more risk aversion, and more risk taking.</p><p>The DTM has potential to connect individual-level decision making to population-level and societal questions. These questions encompass the effects of increasing inequality on aggregate outcomes, and the behavioural effects and optimal design of the welfare state. For us, the DTM's potential role as a micro-macro linking theory is one of its main appeals, giving it the potential to lie at the heart of a generative research programme spanning cognitive and social sciences.</p><p>A middle-range theory like the DTM should be discarded if it fails to give rise to a generative research programme, where generativity is assessed by: connecting diverse phenomena; producing new avenues for enquiry; and the capacity to be progressively refined by data whilst retaining a core set of assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Lakatos, 1963)</ref>. We stressed the diversity of relevant evidence in section 3, and the DTM's ability to illuminate population-level phenomena in section 4. On the basis of sections 3 and 4, we contend that the DTM could lie at the core of a generative research programme; though of course, only time will tell. Like any mid-level theory of human behaviour, the DTM raises many further detailed questions about the interpretation of its key constructs, their cognitive representation, and how they apply to different societal contexts. We hope to have stimulated research on these issues by writing this article.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>(A) Utility functions that count as instances of the DTM.
