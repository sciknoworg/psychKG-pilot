				<p>Imagining future events is a crucial cognitive process in adaptation, but impairments have been identified in a range of mental disorders. Taking a functional approach to future thinking, this paper reports on the development and deployment of a scale to assess the frequency of self-reported functions of future thinking: The Functions of Future Thinking Scale (FoFTS). In Study 1 (N = 565) items were developed and subjected to exploratory factor analysis. Ten factors were extracted representing distinct purposes of future thinking:</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 3</head><p>Future thinking refers to the mental simulation of future events or circumstances that one might be personally involved in <ref type="bibr">(Atance &amp; O'Neil, 2001)</ref>, and is used frequently in daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barsics, Van der Linden, &amp; D'Argembeau, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">D'Argembeau, Renaud, &amp; Van der Linden, 2011)</ref>. Future thinking is thought to be reliant on, but distinct from, mentally simulating events from memory <ref type="bibr">(Suddendorf, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Schacter, Addis, &amp; Buckner, 2007)</ref>. Indeed, anticipating future experiences involves the recall and recombination of information stored in the form of semantic memory (abstracted knowledge, ideas, and concepts) and episodic memory (autobiographical events with contextual details) in order simulate possible circumstances.</p><p>Research has indicated that future thinking is impaired or abnormal in a range of mental disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, and bipolar disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hallford, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hallford, Austin, Takano, &amp; Raes, 2018)</ref>. There is substantial variation between individuals on various dimensions of future thinking, and a range of measures have been used to capture these differences. These have focused on variables such as the frequency or clarity of thoughts of one's future self <ref type="bibr">(McElwee &amp; Haugh, 2009)</ref>, preferences and attitudes towards future-oriented thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Webster, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Zimbardo &amp; Boyd, 1999)</ref>, the ability to imagine specific, spatiotemporally located future events <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Hallford, Austin, Takano, &amp; Raes, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Levine, Svoboda, Hay, Winocur, Moscovitch, 2002)</ref>, and consideration of the future consequences of actions <ref type="bibr">(Strathman, Gliecher, Boninger, &amp; Edwards, 1994)</ref>. Other studies have assessed particular phenomenological characteristics of future thinking, such as the amount of detail (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beaty, Seli, &amp; Schacter, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blackwell et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cole, Morrison, &amp; Conway, 2013)</ref>, the use of verbal or mental imagery (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beaty et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blackwell et al., 2013)</ref>, and perspective (e.g., first person or observer perspectives; D'Argembeau &amp; Van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Linden, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Vasquez &amp; Buehler, 2007)</ref>. Such research has helped clarify the role of future thinking in attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Zimbardo &amp; Boyd, 1999)</ref>, behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Zimbardo, Keough, &amp; Boyd, 1997)</ref>, and mental well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Raffard, Esposito, Boulenger, &amp; Van der Linden, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Rush &amp; Grouzet, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Webster &amp; Ma, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Zimbardo &amp; Boyd, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>One understudied approach to future thinking is from a functional perspective. That is, examining the explicit purposes of why individuals engage in future thinking. If one assumes that the capacity to mentally generate future scenarios has evolved due to it giving humans some adaptive advantage, then it follows that it serves particular functions <ref type="bibr">(Suddendorf, 2009)</ref>. Much research to date has examined future thinking by studying FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 4 its effects on specific decision-making tasks or behavioural outcomes (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Schacter, Benoit, &amp; Szpunar, 2017</ref> for a recent review). Research on these effects has tended to stipulate reasons for participants to engage in future thinking by nature of the research question (e.g., to think of a positive future event to gauge attitudes, consider specific outcomes of a decision, or solve a problem). This approach isolates the use of future thinking for a prescribed purpose. We propose that another fruitful approach would be to assess a range of reasons why, in daily life, individuals use future thinking, and how often they do so. Such a measure could help predict the association between future thinking and other traits, emotional states, and behavioural outcomes as distinct from the general tendency to think about the future (i.e., time perspective) and the specific content of thoughts (e.g., imagining feared outcomes during a particular event). An example in depression will illustrate this distinction. Depressive symptoms are associated with less frequent thoughts of specific positive future events <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hallford, 2019)</ref>, and less detail and use of mental imagery which predicts lower anticipation of pleasure <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hallford et al., 2020)</ref>. A lack of anticipation or experience of pleasure is a key criterion of depression and a maintaining factor <ref type="bibr">(American Psychiatric Association, 2000)</ref>. Here we can see that these two levels of analysis implicate future thinking in a model of depressive psychopathology. Incorporating a functional approach would enrich this by also considering whether depressive symptoms are associated with less propensity to imagine future events as a means to, for example, promote positive feelings (up-regulating positive emotion function), decide whether or not to engage in a behavior (decision-making function), or establish what one's goals would be by doing so (goal-setting function). This functional level of analysis therefore considers the reasons for which future thinking is being used and represents a separate target for specific interventions. Indeed, much of cognitive-behavioural therapy involves bringing awareness to the purposes of different thoughts, feelings, and behaviours, and promoting their use in adaptive ways. For example, people are taught to imagine the consequences of avoiding or enacting certain behaviours (decision-making function), to habituate to adverse emotional reactions (down-regulating negative emotions function), and to plan out specific actions (planning function). Some researchers have adopted this level of analysis through explicitly asking individuals the purpose of future thinking, and providing a limited set of options <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barsics et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">D'Argembeau et al., 2011)</ref>. In other studies people are asked to imagine a series of future events and to evaluate their perceived functions FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 5 using rating scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Duffy &amp; Cole, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Özbek, Bohn, &amp; Berntsen, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rasmussen &amp; Berntsen, 2013)</ref>. To date, however, no standardized tool has been evaluated to assess individual variation in why people engage in future thinking. This approach has already been enormously beneficial in advancing understanding of autobiographical memory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bluck, Alea, Habermas, &amp; Rubin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Webster, 1993)</ref>, but is under-utilized in future thinking. Further, to our knowledge this functional approach to studying future thinking has not been used in the context of psychopathology. There would be a range of possible benefits to having such a standardized tool for future thinking: 1) it would allow researchers to more easily compare findings on the purposes/motivation for imagining future events and the frequency of this, 2) it would increase knowledge of the function and frequency of future thinking and correlates that can be integrated into models of normal and abnormal psychology, 3) it would facilitate study of how individual differences affect function and frequency of future thinking, and 4) changes in the frequency of future thinking can be assessed across different contexts, and as an outcome of targeted intervention, for example, in populations such as depression that exhibit deficits in future thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hallford, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hallford et al., 2018)</ref>, anticipation of pleasure <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hallford &amp; Sharma, 2019)</ref> and impairments in reward valuation and hopelessness <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Pulcu et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The aim of this study was to develop and psychometrically validate a self-report tool to measure the frequency of future thinking for various functions, henceforth referred as the Functions of Future Thinking Scale (FoFTS). Firstly, a pool of items referring to specific uses for future thinking was developed, and then subjected to factor analysis. Secondly, the relative frequency of functions was examined, and convergent and divergent validity was assessed by comparing the FoFTS with existing measures of future thinking and other variables with transdiagnostic relevance in mental health disorders. Importantly, the incremental validity of the FoFTS was assessed by examining whether it would predict variance in these transdiagnostic variables above other dimensions of future thinking including frequency, attitudes towards future thinking, and clarity of future thought. Thirdly, the FoFTS items were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis in a separate sample to further assess the model fit. Fourthly, the FoFTS was deployed in a sample of individuals with probable depression to assess whether this psychopathology affected the purposes of future thinking.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 6</head><p>Participants and Procedure Following approval from the university human research ethics committee, a sample of 725 participants were recruited to participate in the study from social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and forums such as Reddit. The only inclusion criterion was to be 18 years of age or older. Participation was voluntary, and no incentives were offered. After removing participants that did not complete all of the FoFTS items, the sample used for analysis consisted of 564 people, allowing for an adequately stable factor solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(MacCallum, Widaman, Zhang, &amp; Hong, 1999)</ref>. Participants completed the items in this survey as part of a larger survey, which took an average of 28.4 (SD = 39.8) minutes to complete.</p><p>The mean age of the sample was 34.2 years (SD = 12.8, 52.2% women). The majority of the participants identified as Caucasian (77.6%), with the remaining identifying as Asian (6.8%), African (6.0%), Latino or Hispanic (3.6%), Arab or Middle Eastern (0.2%), and other (5.9%). With respect to highest educational achievement, 23.8% of the sample had postgraduate qualifications, 46.5% had bachelor degrees, 14% had completed a diploma or certificate, 15.5% had completed high school, and 0.2% had finished primary school.</p><p>The majority of the sample reported being in paid work (85.3%), and 36.5% were currently studying. The majority were in a romantic relationship, with 33.2% married and living together, 2.3% married but not living together, 14.7% living together but not married, and 12.4% neither married nor living together. The remainder were single (37.4%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Functions of Future Thinking Scale (FoFTS).</head><p>The test items were developed based on a range of functions of future thinking identified through previous research, review articles on future thinking, and studies of functions of autobiographical memory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Atance &amp; O'Neill, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barsics et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bluck, Alea, Habermas, &amp; Rubin, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Schacter et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Szpunar, Spreng, &amp; Schacter, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Webster, 1993)</ref>. A pool of items was generated. An iterative process was then undertaken with possible functions and items discussed by authors. This resulted in a final pool of 80 items, with eight items used to assess each of 10 different proposed functions: solving future problems, goal setting, planning out sequences of actions, thinking of outcomes of decisions, upregulating positive emotion, socially bonding/increasing closeness with others, downregulating negative emotion in relation to upcoming experiences, reducing boredom and entertaining oneself, thinking FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 7 about the type of person one might want to be, and anticipating and adjusting to the idea of death. This list of functions was not presumed to be exhaustive. Rather it consisted of 10 functions that were represented in current literature on future thinking and had some relevance to psychopathology. Prior to completing the items, instructions were provided to participants advising them that they would read a series of statements about how and why they think about their own future. They were asked to respond to each item to indicate how frequently they thought about their personal future for the purposes that were indicated (see Appendix 1 for full instructions). They were told that this thinking could relate to things that they could experience very soon, or very far into the future. To assess the frequency of future thinking for each item a 5-point self-report scale was used: 1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Sometimes, 4 = Often, 5 = Very Often. The items were blocked according to the proposed function they referred to, and the order of presentation of these blocks was randomized to mitigate order effects.</p><p>It was thought that responses to the FoFTS items would likely share variance that reflected a general tendency to think about the future, and therefore this was also measured. This could then be controlled for in analyses to estimate how each function might uniquely vary with one another, and how specific functions might have incremental validity in prediction in addition to overall frequency of future thinking. Items to assess how frequently individuals thought about their future generally, at different time distances, were taken from Hallford (2019). The instructions for these items was "These questions are about how far into your future you tend to think", which was followed by a series of stems, "How frequently do you tend to think about your future for things that will happen…", with the branches of "later that day, tomorrow, over the next week, over the next year, in over a year, and in over ten years". The same 5-point scale was used as above. As indicated through factor analysis in their previous use, the items relating to the 'short-term future' ('later that day', 'tomorrow', 'over the next week') were averaged together and items relating to the 'long-term future' ('over the next year', 'in over a year', and 'in over ten years') were averaged together to form two subscales which showed acceptable internal reliability (both McDonald's ω = .82). They correlated only weakly (r = .16, p &lt; .001), indicating they were largely distinct processes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures to Assess Construct Validity</head><p>To assess convergent and divergent validity, two measures of future thinking and a measure of functions FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 8 of autobiographical memory were used. Four variables with transdiagnostic relevance to mental health disorders were also used, described below. To reduce the burden on participants, the measures used in the study were distributed across several different survey forms (all containing the FoFTS items) and presentation of these forms was randomized across participants. Consequently, a subset of 182 participants completed the validity measures, except for the Positive and Negative Affect Scale <ref type="bibr">(MacKinnon et al., 1999)</ref> which was completed by 153 participants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">&amp; Boyd, 1999)</ref>. Three-item versions of the future negative and future positive subscales from the self-report ZTPS were used to assess how negative or positively-valenced people judged their future thinking as being <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Košťál, Klicperová-Baker, Lukavská, &amp; Lukavský, 2016)</ref>.  physical well-being in a transdiagnostic manner, promoting adaptive behaviours and cognitive responses to stressors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Conversano et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gallgher et al., 2019)</ref>.

Participants responded using five-point response scale: 1 = I Disagree a Lot, 2 = I Disagree a Little, 3 = I neither Agree nor Disagree, 4 = I Agree a Little, and 5 = I Agree a Lot. The internal reliability of the scale was good (McDonald's ω = .85).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>New General Self-Efficacy Scale (NGSE; Chen, Gully, &amp; Eden, 2001</head><p>). NGSE was used to assess self-efficacy, which has relevance for a range of emotional disorders and is considered a modifiable factor in mental health and interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barlow et al., 2017)</ref>. This eight-item self-report scale was used to assess generalized perceptions of competency in achieving tasks or goals. Participants responded using a five-point response scale: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neither Disagree nor Agree, 4 = Agree, and 5 = Strongly Agree.

Kerns, &amp; Barlow, 2013)</ref>. Participants responded to five positive adjectives to indicate how extent they felt that way using a five-point response scale: 1 = Very Slightly or Not at All, 2 = A Little, 3 = Moderately, 4 = Quite a Bit, and 5 = Extremely. The internal reliability of the scale was good (McDonald's ω = .88).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analytic Approach</head><p>Parallel analysis (Horn, 1965) was conducted on the FoFTS items to determine the number of factors to FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 10 extract using the R package version 3.6.1. Parallel analysis involves the creation of a random dataset using Monte Carlo simulation with the same number of observations and variables as the original dataset under consideration.</p><p>Eigenvalues from this random dataset are then compared to eigenvalues extracted from the actual dataset to assess the number of factors that are likely to occur by chance, and those that could be retained. Given the data was ordinal in nature, the ordinary least squares estimator technique was used to extract factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gaskin &amp; Happell, 2014)</ref>, with an oblique rotation using the oblimin function. The fit indices used were the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) of Factor Reliability, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the root mean square residual. These fit indices were assessed relative to guidelines provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Hu and Bentler (1999)</ref>: TLI ≥ .95, RMSEA ≤ .06, and RMSR ≤. 08. The remaining statistics were performed in SPSS Version 25. Descriptive statistics were generated, and the internal reliability amongst the items was assessed using McDonald's ω.</p><p>Pearson correlations were used to assess zero-order correlations, and partial correlations were used to assess the associations between the FoFTS subscales and other measures while controlling for the effect of short-term and long-term general future thinking subscales. This would establish whether the FoFTS shared variance with other variables distinct from the frequency of future thinking, and therefore would provide evidence for its incremental validity. Given the number of correlations and inflated risk of Type 1 error, the alpha level was set at .001 for these analyses. A repeated measures ANCOVA was conducted to compare the mean scores of the FoFTS subscales, while controlling for short-term and long-term general future thinking. Bonferroni corrections were used to control for Type 1 errors in pairwise contrasts. A further test of incremental validity was attempted by using hierarchical multiple regressions to see if the FoFTS would predict unique variance in optimism, selfefficacy, and worry after accounting for variance predicted by attitudes towards the future (using the ZTPS) or clarity of future thought (using the FSQ). The PANAS could not be included in these analyses as it was in a different form of the survey to the ZTPS and FSQ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploratory Factor Analysis of the FoFTS Items</head><p>The FoFTS items data were suitable for factor analysis, as indicated the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (.956), significant results of Bartlett's Test of Sphericity (p &lt; .001), all diagonal elements on the anti-image correlation matrix being &gt; .9, and off-diagonals 0.01 -0.25. All communalities were above 0.52, FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 11 with the exception of one item which was 0.42. Parallel analysis indicated 10 factors could be extracted from the item pool (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>. A ten-factor model was specified, and compared with nine and eleven factor models. The ten-factor model explained 61% of the variance in responses, and each of the eight items loading onto their hypothesized latent variables in a theorycongruent way. Item loadings were all above .50, and typically above .60, with no cross-loadings above .20. The sum of square loadings ranged from 6.1 to 3.8. The fit indices showed the model was an acceptable fit to the data: TLI = .89, RMSEA = .046, RMSR = 0.02.</p><p>The nine-factor model explained 59% of the variance, with the only difference being that the items assessing planning and decision-making loaded onto one factor, albeit, some with loadings &lt; .40. The sum of square loadings ranged from 6.1 to 4.1. The fit indices showed the model was a slightly poorer fit: TLI = .87, RMSEA = .050, RMSR = 0.03.</p><p>The 11-factor model explained 62% of the variance in responses, again with items loading in a similar manner. The 11 th factor was accounted for largely by one item cross-loading at .22 from the decision-making factor, and another from the goal setting factor at .43. The sum of square loadings ranged from 3.9 to 1.6, with the 11 th factor having a loading of only 0.8. The fit indices were: TLI = .90, RMSEA = .050, RMSR = 0.04.</p><p>Taking the statistical tests into account, the 10-factor model was the best fit to the data and was consistent with the hypothesized latent variables that the items were designed to assess. The 11-factor model had a seemingly redundant factor, and therefore was not a plausible structure. The nine-factor model offered a more parsimonious factor structure relative to the 10-factor model. However, planning and decision-making are theoretically distinct constructs. Further, the subscales correlated at r = 0.55 in the 10-factor model, indicating the majority of their variance was not shared.</p><p>An attempt was then made to trim the number of items down to three per factor, so as to make the scale more feasible for use. To do this, the three items with strongest factor loadings and weakest cross-loadings from each factor in the 10-factor model were subjected to another parallel analysis in the same dataset. The results using this 30-item pool indicated a nine or 10 factor model (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). These models were extracted, along with an eight-factor model for comparison. The nine-factor model explained 63% of variance in responses, with assessing planning and goal setting items loading onto one factor (sum of square loadings ranging from 2.5 to 1.8). The fit FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 12 indices were: TLI = .93, RMSEA = .052, RMSR = 0.03. The eight-factor model explained 61% of the variance, with planning, goal setting, and decision-making items loading onto one factor (sum of square loadings ranging from 3.6 to 1.2). This model was a poorer fit compared to the nine-factor model: TLI = .90, RMSEA = .041, RMSR = 0.06. Lastly, the ten-factor model showed the items loading onto the hypothesized latent variables, explaining 65% of the variance (sum of square loadings ranging from 3.0 to 2.0), and fit indices showing a superior fit relative to the eight and nine-factor models: TLI = .96, RMSEA = .041, RMSR = 0.02. On all of the models, item factors loadings were generally strong and cross-loadings were low. In particular, the ten-factor model showed a clean factor structure, with all loadings ≥ .55 and few cross-loadings ≥ .10. The statistical evidence indicated the ten-factor model was the best fit to the data, and was again theory-congruent in terms of items loading onto conceptually different factors. Given that, the 10-factor model was retained. </p></div>

As expected, all FoFTS subscales correlated significantly with short and long-term general future thinking. When controlling for short and long-term general future thinking, the correlations between the FoFTS subscales were generally in the same direction, but were attenuated, and more of them were not statistically significant, particularly in the case of the boredom reduction, negative emotion regulation, and death preparation subscales. In the sample as a whole, a paired-sample t-test showed that participants reported more frequent short-term future thinking (M = 4.22, SD = 1.18) relative to long-term future thinking (M = 3.66, SD = 1.28), t(564) = 8.17, p &lt; .001, d = 0.44.</p></div>

Importantly, the scales showed incremental validity by predicting additional variance in transdiagnostic variables when accounting for overall frequency of thinking about one's future, attitudes towards one's future, and the clarity of thinking about one's future.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedure</head><p>The sample comprised 467 participants living in the U.S., recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing website. Interested participants were taken to a website with the plain language statement and prompted to complete the FoFTS items first as part of a larger survey. Informed consent was implied by completion of the questionnaire. Participants were compensated with a nominal sum of US$1.</p><p>To improve the integrity of the data in the MTurk context, an instructional manipulation check was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Oppenheimer, Meyvis, &amp; Davidenko, 2009)</ref>. The first survey item required them to provide the correct response to a question relating to a favorite sporting activity, which was embedded in a paragraph of text instructions. They could not advance until this question was answered correctly. This approach has been shown to reduce careless responding, whereby where participants fail the item, repeat it, and then answer correctly, their responses to subsequent items have been shown to be similar to those that pass it the first time <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Oppenheimer et al., 2009)</ref>. The survey was attempted a total of 603 times, with 530 participants with correct attempts at the instructional manipulation check. A further 21 cases were removed due to incomplete data, and 40 duplicate responses were removed, leaving a final sample of 467 that was used for the CFA. This would statistically-power the CFA to find the predicted associations, taking into account the number of latent factors, factor loadings and inter-correlations of the items in Study 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Wolf, Harrington, Clark, &amp; Miller, 2013)</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analytic Approach</head><p>To assess the factor structure, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted using the Lavaan package <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Rosseel, 2012)</ref> in R version 3.5.1. A weighted least square means with variance adjusted robust estimator (WLSMV) was used to estimate the model.

A range of indices were used to assess model fit: The chi-square value (CMIN) and</p><p>corresponding p-value (set at p &lt; .05), the relative chi-square statistic (CMIN/DF) using a conservative guide of &lt;2.0 for indicating good fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007)</ref>, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and the comparative fit index (CFI).

Several specific hypotheses were made. It was predicted that probable major depression would be related to a higher overall frequency of future thinking, based on previous findings in dysphoria . It was also predicted that depression would be associated with more future thinking for boredom reduction, given that diagnosed depression and dysphoria are related to high levels of task-unrelated mind-wandering <ref type="bibr">(Hoffman, Banzhaf, Kanske, Bermpohl, &amp; Singer, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Smallwood, O'Connor, Sudbery, &amp; Obonsawin, 2007)</ref>. Given that suicidal ideation, hopelessness, pessimistic thinking are hallmarks of clinical depression, it was also predicted there would be a higher frequency of death preparation and negative emotion regulation functions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>This study aimed to develop and validate the first standardized measure of self-reported functions of thinking about one's future: The Functions of Future Thinking Scale (FoFTS). In Study 1, exploratory factor analysis indicated that a 10-factor model for the FoFTS items was a good fit to the data and could be reduced to three items while still retaining a good model fit and internal consistency for the subscales. In Study 2 the 10factor model was an excellent fit to the data, with items loading strongly onto their respective factors. This resulted in the 30-item FoFTS that assesses: planning, goal setting, decision-making, thinking about the type of person one wants to become, solving problems, upregulating positive emotion, social bonding, downregulating negative emotion about negative future experiences, reducing boredom/passing time, and thinking about and adjusting to death. The correlations with validity measures showed support for construct validity. Functions relating to negative content or distraction were associated with more negative future thinking, while directivetype functions were associated with positive future thinking. Moderate-sized correlations were found between the FoFTS and autobiographical memory functions, supporting previous research of the overlap between past and future thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Schacter et al, 2007)</ref>. The FoFTS also showed incremental validity over the frequency of future thinking, attitudes towards one's future, and the clarity of future thinking. This indicates that this functional approach can provide a unique way of predicting transdiagnostic variables and depressive symptoms relative to some other dimensions of future thinking.</p><p>Along with the main FoFTS subscales, the current study provides a measure of the frequency of future thinking in general. Short-term general future thinking was more frequent than long-term, supportive of the idea that people tend to focus more on future circumstances that are nearer in time and that need to be attended to relative to distant future possibilities (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">D'Argembeau et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Spreng &amp; Levine, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, short and long-term future thinking were only weakly correlated. The tendency to think about the short-term future, and not the long-term future, may express as impulsivity whereby the immediate consequences of actions are focused on to the neglect of future consequences. Short-term future thoughts might also function as reminders of actions that need to be done in the next few days <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson &amp; McDaniel, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Conway, Loveday, &amp; Cole, 2016)</ref>. These scales appear useful to partial out the general tendency to think about the future when using the FoFTS, or used in their own right.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 22</head><p>The most frequent use of future thinking was for directive-type functions of setting goals, making decisions, planning out actions, solving problems, and imagining the type of person one wants to become (identity contrasting). These functions share the common feature of being task or goal-oriented, and in the service of giving rise to related, purposeful action. This is perhaps unsurprising given that a primary role of imagining the future is to address current concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barsics et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cole &amp; Berntsen, 2016)</ref>, and that even mind-wandering has been found to frequently involve autobiographical planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Baird, Smallwood, &amp; Schooler, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Duffy &amp; Cole, 2020)</ref>. These findings are also consistent with a previous diary study where the participants nominated 'planning actions' and 'intention-formation' as the most frequent reasons for thinking about the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barsics et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barsics et al. (2016)</ref> findings, participants endorsed using future thinking for regulating emotions less frequently than directive-type functions. The FoFTS assesses up-regulation of current positive emotion and down-regulation of negative emotion associated with future events with separate subscales which did not correlate (after controlling for general future thinking). The positive emotion subscale correlated with positive affect and higher self-efficacy, whereas the negative emotion subscale did not, and the negative emotion subscale correlated with high worry, whereas the positive emotion subscale did not. This indicates that they assess different processes in regulation rather than just being an inverse of one another. The participants reported using future thinking to up-regulate positive emotions more often than to down regulate negative emotions about future events. This might be reflective of the general positivity bias in the valence of episodic thinking, both past and future (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Marsh, Edginton, Conway, &amp; Loveday, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Salgado &amp; Berntsen, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, upregulating positive emotion had only a weak, and non-significant correlation with optimism after post-hoc correction (p = .002). Even without this correction, this indicates that the purposeful act of thinking about future events to upregulate current mood was only weakly associated with the general disposition for positive outcome expectancies, perhaps reflecting a distinction between purposeful behaviour versus a general tendency or attitude. Interactions between these variables might be of interest in future research examining change in positive attitude.</p><p>As expected, the subscales correlated with each other across both studies, with the exception of death preparation which was less consistent. The subscale correlations were reduced when general future thinking FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 23 was accounted for, particularly in the case of functions of death preparation, boredom reduction, and negative emotion regulation which were not significantly associated with some directive functions. Future thinking for problem-solving was positively associated with down-regulating negative emotion related to upcoming events, and to reduce boredom and pass time. This is possibly indicative of attempts to feel less negatively about problems, or to avoid thinking about them. Although the correlations between the subscales, and particularly the directive subscales, were high in some cases, they were not indicative of co-linearity, and they were associated with measures of convergent and divergent validity in different ways.</p><p>There was some evidence that older age was related to less future thinking overall, and in terms of boredom reduction. This indicated that older people report less frequently future thinking in order to keep their mind active or pass time. This may be due to older adults being later in the lifespan, having less time ahead of them in life, and therefore being oriented towards present or past experiences in order to fulfil social and emotional-directed goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Carstensen, Isaacowitz, &amp; Charles, 1999)</ref>. The current study had a limited range of age, however, with few older adults, and further research is needed to assess whether these effects are stronger or more consistent with samples that include an older demographic. The findings were mixed for education, but taken together they indicate that higher education is related to more long-term future thinking, but not strongly or consistently related to future thinking otherwise. Differences in frequency between men and women were inconsistent, with Study 1 indicating men reported more frequent boredom reduction, down-regulating negative emotion related to events and death preparation, but these were not replicated in Study 2. Given this, further research examining gender differences is warranted.</p><p>The findings from Study 3 support previous findings that depressive symptoms are associated with more frequent future thinking overall <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hallford, 2019)</ref>, albeit this tends to be more abstracted and general <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hallford et al., 2018)</ref>. The finding of higher frequency of boredom reduction indicates that individuals with probable major depression think more frequently about the future as a means of entertainment and staving off boredom. This is somewhat consistent with previous studies showing higher task-unrelated mind-wandering in depression <ref type="bibr">(Hoffman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Smallwood et al., 2007)</ref>. More future thinking for boredom reduction may be a product of having fewer stimulating activities and reduced behavioural activation in depression, or may be a distraction from other negative internal or external experiences. Increased future thinking for death preparation is FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 24 consistent with suicidal ideation as a symptom of depression. Increased imagining of negative future events is consistent with pessimistic and hopeless thinking styles in depression, but highlights an increased effort to try and regulate emotions related to these negative future experiences. The findings of reduced frequency of planning and decision-making were particularly novel. For planning, this suggests that those with probable depression are less likely to imagine the steps that are needed to enact plans and behaviours. This is consistent with findings in depression on problem-solving tasks which require the generation of steps that would be taken to solve challenges (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Marx, Williams, &amp; Claridge, 1992)</ref>. For decision-making, it indicates that those with probable depression less often consider the outcomes or consequences when there are several options of behavior. This is consistent with prior research indicating that depression is associated with impulsivity, and potentially as a factor in suicide attempts <ref type="bibr">(Corruble, Damy, &amp; Guelfi, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Granö et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Ozten &amp; Erol, 2019)</ref>. In general, less frequently imagining the consequences of choices is likely to be maladaptive, as individuals may not anticipate negative consequences, or at least may make decisions based on factors other than how consistent a choice is with their goals. Reduced future thinking for planning and decision-making might be related to reduced specificity in depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hallford et al., 2018)</ref>, whereby difficulties in imagining spatiotemporally-located circumstances inhibit the capacity to plan or anticipate outcomes effectively. Future research might investigate this further. Potentially, reduced future thinking regarding choices may be one factor in anhedonia, avoidance and psychosocial withdrawal in depression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>The self-report nature of the FoFTS means it is largely retrospective. This might impact its validity given that the recall and frequency estimation of future thoughts may not be accurate. However, the rough concordance between this study and previous diary-based research <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barsics et al., 2016)</ref> indicates that responses to the FoFTS might map roughly onto the frequency of real-time purposes of engaging in future thinking. Much of future thinking is involuntary though <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Berntsen &amp; Jacobsen, 2008)</ref>, and at times its functions may be either unclear, or we might not be consciously aware of them. Therefore, the FoFTS might be accurately conceptualized as capturing the meta-cognitive awareness of future thinking. Future research might use the FoFTS in ecological momentary assessment designs as a standardized taxonomy of functions that are comparable across studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 25</head><p>It would be interesting to study whether particular uses of future thinking are associated with phenomenal characteristics, such as detail, imagery, or observer perspective. The interaction between particular purposes and particular characteristics of future thinking might have important implications for adaptation. For example, individuals who used future thinking for planning more frequently and reported higher levels of detail/vividness and mental imagery might be more effective in mapping out behaviours to reach goals. More frequent goal setting, in conjunction with higher levels of positive anticipated emotion, might lead to a higher likelihood of behavioural intention or enactment of goal-directed behavior (see <ref type="bibr">Hallford, Farrell, &amp; Lynch, 2020 for</ref> increasing positive anticipated emotion through simulation). In contrast, thinking of future events in abstracted forms that induce feelings of positive emotion might be beneficial in certain social bonding situations to create good will and generalized positive expectancies. For example, imagining an upcoming trip with a friend as exciting and adventurous.</p><p>The FoFTS might be deployed in other clinical populations to further understanding of how future thinking is a factor in the maintenance of psychopathology or health behaviors. Given that many intervention programs aim to change how people engage in prospective thought, whether implicitly or explicitly (see <ref type="bibr">Roepke &amp;</ref> Seligman, 2016 for a review in the context of depression), the FoFTS might be used as an outcome measure to assess change over time. Examining whether particular uses of future thinking might be characteristic of particular personality traits might also be of interest. For example, those who are high on conscientiousness might be more likely to use future thinking for goal setting, planning, and decision-making, whereas those high on dependent traits might less frequently engage in such thinking. A future direction would be to collect longitudinal data for the FoFTS to clarify whether tendencies in future thinking are more or less stable traits or context or time-variable. This might also indicate how they are conceptualized as points of intervention.</p><p>There may also be ways to further parse the functions of future thinking assessed in the FoFTS in order to answer more specific questions. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Schacter et al. (2017)</ref> propose spatial navigation as a function of future thinking, which may be thought of as a specific planning function of coordinating the movement of the body through space. As noted, the functions that are assessed here are not considered to be an exhaustive list.</p><p>In conclusion, the FoFTS is a simple, psychometrically-sound, self-report tool. It assesses the frequency of thinking about the future for different purposes, and is related to a range of important psychological states FUTURE THINKING FUNCTIONS 26 and processes. The FoFTS is a useful tool for future research taking a functional approach to future thinking.</p></div>

The clarity subscale of the FSQ was used to assess the clarity with which people have thoughts about themselves in the future (e.g., 'When I picture my future, I see clear and vivid images'). This subscale was initially validated with five items, however, in this sample the reverse-scored item correlated poorly with the other items in this sample (average r = .11) and was therefore removed. A 6-point response scale was used ranging from 1 = Not True at all for me to 6 = Completely True for Me. The internal reliability of the scale was good, McDonald's ω = .85.

Education correlated with more frequent long-term general future thinking, but did not correlate with short-term or any specific function.For gender, independent samples t-tests indicated women thought more frequently about their short-term future (M = 4.34, SD = 1.19) relative to men (M = 4.07, SD = 1.16), t(559) = 2.66, p = .008, d = 0.29, but there was no difference for long-term future (women: M = 3.59 [SD = 1.32]; men M = 3.74 [SD = 1.24], t[559] = 1.33, p = .183, d = 0.11). To assess differences on the FoFTS subscales, between-groups ANCOVAs controlling for short and long-term general future thinking were used. Men were found to report more frequent use of futurethinking for reducing boredom (men: M = 2.96 [SD = 1.13]; women M = 2.63 [SD = 1.12], F[1, 557] =12.7, p &lt; .001, partial eta square = 0.02), preparing for death (men: M = 2.83 [SD = 1.23]; women M = 2.15 [SD = 1.02], ], F[1, 557] =56.4, p &lt; .001, partial eta square = 0.09), and for negative emotion regulation (men: M = 3.09 [SD = 1.06]; women M = 2.86 [SD = 0.98], ], F[1, 557] =10.0, p &lt; .001, partial eta square = 0.01), albeit all effects were small. ) are shown inTable 3. The FoFTS subscales that were related to negatively-valenced content (reducing boredom, preparing for death, and down-regulating negative emotion) correlated with the ZTPS future negative subscale, the FoFTS subscales related to constructive or positive content (goal setting, planning, decision-making, and up-regulating positive emotion) correlated with the ZTPS positive future subscale. More frequent future thinking for boredom reduction, death preparation, and negative emotion regulation were associated with less clarity of thinking about one's future. The FoFTS subscales concerned with boredom reduction, identity contrasting, and social bonding correlated with TALE self-function and social bonding scales, while more task-oriented FoFTS subscales (goal setting, problems-solving, decision-making, and imagining oneself changing with identify contrast) correlated with the TALE directive function. No FoFTS subscales correlated significantly with optimism at the p &lt; .001 level. The FoFTS subscales pertaining to directive functions of goal setting, planning, decision-making, and up-regulating positive emotion were all positively correlated with higher self-efficacy. FoFTS subscales of down-regulation of negative emotion and problem-solving were positively correlated with higher worry as assessed using the PSWQ. Lastly, the FoFTS subscales of social bonding, goal setting, and up-regulation of positive emotion correlated with positive affect. Two-step hierarchal multiple regressions were then conducted to test the incremental validity of the FoFTS scales in relation to attitudes towards future thinking and the clarity of future thought.
