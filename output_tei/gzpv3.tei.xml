			<abstract>
				<p>Almost all formal models of decision-making under uncertainty require agents to judge the likelihood of relevant uncertainties. Typically, decisions are best made when these judgements are unbiased. In the context of probabilistic subjective survival expectations, from a nationally representative English sample of participants aged over 50, we test whether IQ is associated with calibration. We find strong evidence that high-IQ respondents make substantially lower forecasting errors and produce less noise in their predictions than low-IQ respondents. These results are confirmed when we leverage the randomness in genetic variants linked to IQ as an instrumental variable (Mendelian Randomization) and when directly using participants genetic variants related to educational attainment-that captures IQ as well as other cognitive and noncognitive traits relevant to educational success. These results highlight important channels through which IQ contributes to different beliefs about the world and may explain why low-IQ is often linked to poor financial decision-making, lower economic growth and economic welfare, and judgemental biases.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Walter Bagehot the 18 th century economist described life as a "school of probability". Almost all formal models of decision-making under uncertainty follow this blueprint for life by requiring agents to form probabilistic assessments. For instance, the normative subjective expected utility model (SEU; <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Savage, 1954)</ref> assumes that agents choose between a set of options where choices are based on a subjective assessment of the desirability of each option, weighted by a subjective probability distribution. In this framework, decisions made with unbiased assessments of probabilities, maximise expected utility and inaccurate assessments impose costs. Our ability to accurately assess the probability distribution over future outcomes is therefore considered an essential component of individuals' decision-making competence (Bruine de Bruin, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Parker &amp; Fischhoff, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Parker &amp; Fischhoff, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Notwithstanding the predictive validity of subjective probabilities, as seen in significant correlations of reported probability assessments with whether or not the predicted event ends up occurring <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Fischhoff et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hurd &amp; McGarry, 2002)</ref>. Theories from the "heuristics and biases" literature alongside the broader literature on "bounded rationality" provide many channels through which the limits of human cognition can fail to produce accurate probability judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Simon, 1955)</ref>. Here, cognitive limitations can affect the processing and gathering of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Simon, 1955)</ref>. Cognitive limitations can also lead to systematic errors in evaluation from the reliance on heuristics (mental shortcuts or 'rules of thumb'; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>. For instance, the availability heuristic-whereby people evaluate the probability of an event by the ease to which instances or occurrences can be brought to mind-can make us overestimate the probability of events that are easily recalled and underestimate the probability of events that are less sensational but more common <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1973)</ref>. Surprisingly, despite these exhaustive literatures on the implications of limited human cognition on forming probabilistic assessments and the featuring role of subjective probabilities in formal models of decision-making, it remains untested whether the accuracy of judgements about uncertainties depends on cognitive (in)ability. This article attempts to address this gap in the literature.</p><p>Understanding to what extent cognitive limitations diminish the accuracy of probabilistic assessments is important for a number of reasons. First-to the extent to which human behavior is captured by normative models of decision making, like SEU, and that low-IQ agents are unsophisticated about their errors in probabilistic assessments-it can provide a new channel through which IQ contributes to different beliefs about the world and may help to understand why low-IQ is related to suboptimal financial decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agarwal &amp; Mazumder, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Grinblatt, Ikäheimo, Keloharju &amp; Knüpfer, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Grinblatt, Keloharju, &amp; Linnainmaa, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, 2012</ref> and to lower economic growth and welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hafer, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer &amp; Miller, 2004)</ref>. Second, it may provide insight into why low-IQ is associated with an increased incidence of judgemental biases, such as the hindsight bias, overconfidence and the sunk cost fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Benjamin, Brown &amp; Shapiro, 2013</ref>; Bruine de Bruin, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Parker &amp; Fischhoff, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Frederick, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hoppe &amp; Kusterer, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Oechssler, Roider &amp; Schmitz, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Stanovich &amp; West, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Toplak, West &amp; Stanovich, 2011)</ref>. For instance, if low-IQ agents are sophisticated about their errors in probabilistic assessments, they may be more reliant on heuristics, and thus more exposed to the accompanying judgemental biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1973)</ref>. Third, it provides an opening for perspectives on the mechanisms through which IQ is transmitted onto probabilistic assessments; on whether low-IQ agents act on their subjective probabilistic assessments; or indeed, on whether IQ matters for eliciting probabilistic or non-probabilistic mindsets <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rottenstreich &amp; Kivetz, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>In this article, we used a large, unbalanced panel of individuals drawn from a nationally representative sample of the English population over age 50 and documented the calibration of probabilistic assessments under limited cognition. As with all tasks, it is important that assessments are elicited in a context where they matter, that is, where there are incentives for accuracy. Our calibration task is probabilistic subjective survival expectations. As proposed by the standard life cycle model in economics <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bachmann et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Springer, 1977)</ref>, how long we expect to live can affect household consumption, investments, retirement, annuities, and savings decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hurd, Smith &amp; Zissimopoulos, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Inkmann, Lopes &amp; Michaelides, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Salm, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Spaenjers &amp; Spira, 2015)</ref>. Importantly, research has also shown that when people make probabilistic errors in judgement, these errors can affect real economic activity through its impact on these important decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Caliendo &amp; Huang, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Claus &amp; Nguyen, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Puri and Robinson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sandroni &amp; Squintani, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>As far as we aware this is the first paper to look at the relationship between the accuracy of probabilistic expectations under limited cognition. Indeed, the closest paper to ours is the recent paper by D'Acunto, Hoang, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Paloviita and Weber (2023)</ref>. In D'Acunto et al. (2023) IQ is linked to more forecasting errors when responding to a non-probabilistic task about the percentage to which consumer prices will change in the next 12 months. Our departure from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">D'Acunto et al. (2023)</ref> continues with two important methodological extensions. Firstly, we leverage the randomness in genetic variation captured by individual polygenic scores (PGS)an individual's genetic predisposition for a given trait-to analyse for the causal relationship between IQ and forecasting errors in probabilistic assessments. In short, we use a special case of instrumental variable (IV) analysis called Mendelian randomization (MR), where genetic variation captured by an individual's polygenic score for IQ is used as an instrument for phenotypic IQ. Secondly, we assess the relationship between forecasting errors and the polygenic score for educational attainment-which proxies cognitive and non-cognitive traits relevant to educational success in addition to the "g" factor of intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Belsky et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lee et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Okbay et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Smith-Woolley, Selzam &amp; Plomin, 2019)</ref>. As the PGS for educational attainment captures many traits associated with educational success it is not suitable as an instrumental variable. However, given that genotypes are randomly assigned from parents to an offspring at conception, the estimated effect of the PGS should be unsusceptible to the problem of reverse causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Madole &amp; Harden, 2023)</ref> and less susceptible to socio-economic and life-style confounders <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Smith et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>All estimation strategies provide strong and consistent evidence that the accuracy of subjective probabilistic assessments is increasing in the agent's IQ. As a final contribution, we exploit the longitudinal nature of the data. Specifically, that respondents reported probabilistic assessments on a repeated basis. As discussed above, IQ can affect the accuracy of subjective probabilistic assessments through the processing and gathering of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Simon, 1955)</ref> and through systematic errors from the reliance on heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>. However, there is another channel through which probabilistic assessments may be inaccurate. Namely, "noise" (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Silva &amp; Thesmar, 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Juodis &amp; Kučinskas, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kahneman, Sibony &amp; Sunstein, 2021)</ref>. Noise, or unsystematic errors, is when there is variability within the judgments of different decision makers (or from the same decision maker on the same data) owing to environmental factors temporarily affecting judgement but having very little to do with the judgment itself. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Simonsohn (2007)</ref> finds that applicants' academic attributes are weighted more heavily on cloudier days and non-academic attributes on sunnier days. For the first time, we find that low-IQ respondents produce more noise-greater variability in the accuracy of their probability assessments when they are asked for repeated estimates of the same event-in their probability estimates. Whilst it is outside the scope of this paper to quantify the relative importance of systematic and unsystematic mistakes in probabilistic assessments. Taken together, our results lead us to conclude that IQ fundamentally matters for the accuracy of probabilistic assessments, and that noise, alongside information and systematic bias are likely contributors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Participants</head><p>To understand the correlation between miscalibrated beliefs and IQ, we used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) 2002 to 2018/19 (Waves 1-9). ELSA is based on data collected from participants aged over 50, who originally took part in the Health Survey for England (an annual national survey). ELSA is broadly representative of the population of older people in England <ref type="bibr">(Steptoe, Breeze, Banks &amp; Nazroo, 2013)</ref>. Starting in 2002, ELSA involves re-interviewing participants approximately every two years. Younger age groups are replaced or refreshed to retain the panel. The sample has been refreshed using participants from the Health Survey for England (HSE) in Waves 3, 4, 6, 7, 9. ELSA includes a broad range of cognitive function measures and importantly subjective survival expectations, which forms the basis of our measurement of belief miscalibration. ELSA also provides genetic data.</p><p>Specifically, polygenic scores (PGSs) are available for a number of behavioural, emotional and health-related phenotypes, including educational attainment and IQ. The analytic samples include data from all individuals who gave valid responses to the dependent, independent and control variables used in the subsequent analysis. This yields an analytic sample of 30,120 person-Wave observations from 3,946 individual respondents.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Forecasting errors</head><p>To measure forecast errors, we must be able to compare participant's expectations with a statistically derived true expected value. This is the approach we take in the realm of subjective survival probabilities. In short, our measure of belief miscalibration in the analyses that follows is based upon, = − . Where is the subjective survival probability for each individual, , at Wave, and is the statistically derived true expected value based upon population life tables. Specifically, to measure we utilize responses to a probabilistic question on survival asked in every wave of ELSA. Specifically, ELSA asks all survey participants "What are the chances that you will live to be or more?" Where is a target age depending on the age of the respondent. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> reports which target age respondents in each age range were asked about and the number of observations and individuals in each age range. Responses are coded on a range from 0 to 100. To measure we utilize the past and projected numbers surviving at exact age from the 2020-based (United Kingdom) life tables obtained from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). These tables give historic and projected life expectancies by single year of age and sex for each year 1981 to 2070. To construct the objective probabilities, as well as using age and sex specific data, we also control for projected changes in mortality throughout a person's life.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">-69  80  5079  2895  70-74  85  5215  2580  75-79  90  3486  1681  80-84  95  1998  1028  85-99  100  904  453  100-104  105  --105-109  110  --110-119  120  --Total  30120  3946</ref> When measuring forecast errors, using age and sex specific actuarial life tables helps to account for exogenous differences that exist across individuals. However, it still leaves our</p><p>forecasting error measure open to many potential alternative interpretations, most notably, differences in life span-influencing factors (i.e., lifestyle factors, objective health, or differences in genetic longevity). Moreover, differences in forecasting errors may also capture heterogeneity in the task at hand. As <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> illustrates, our optimism task is heterogenous within and across respondents, stemming from heterogeneity in the target age or the respondent's proximity to a specific target age <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Wu, Stevens &amp; Thorp, 2015)</ref>. In this view, we estimate Equation (1) via ordinary least-squares (OLS), where is a vector of controls including age (in quadratic form); target age; ethnicity; marital status; smoker status and alcohol consumption; mother's/father's age when she/he died setting the value to the oldest age reported in the panel of the respondent's mother/father for those whose mother/father remained alive throughout the panel (and including a binary variable for whether respondent's mother/father remained alive throughout the panel); and controls for subjective health, chronic illnesses and medical conditions.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= − = + ∑ + (1)</formula><p>The results from Equation (1) are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table S2</ref> in the Supplemental Material and the control variables described in more detail in the Tables caption. Descriptive statistics are also reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref> of the Supplemental Material.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Phenotypic IQ</head><p>ELSA has a broad range of cognitive function tasks designed to measure memory, executive function and basic cognitive skills/abilities. The first task assessed respondents' memory, using an assessment of orientation in time. Specifically, in all Waves, participants were asked todays date, and the interviewer coded whether the day of the month, the month, the year and the day of the week were given correctly. The final score is based on a simple count of number of correct items. The second task was a word-list learning (verbal learning and recall) task.</p><p>Conducted in all Waves, participants were read a series of 10 words and immediately afterwards were asked to recall as many words as possible, in any order. Participants were then asked again, later in the interview, to recall as many words as possible. Scores from the immediate and delayed word recall task were summed together to produce a single measure.</p><p>The third task was a prospective memory task. Conducted in Waves 1-5 and Wave 8,</p><p>1 Importantly, for our subsequent analysis, measuring forecast errors net of lifestyle factors, health, and genetic longevity controls for the possible confounding relationship between intelligence and lifespan <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Whalley &amp; Deary, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Deary, Hill &amp; Gale, 2021)</ref>. Specifically, the link between intelligence and lifespan is thought to operate though inequalities in lifestyle choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Deary, Weiss &amp; Batty, 2010)</ref>; lower risk of diseases such as coronary heart disease, smoking related cancers, respiratory disease, and dementia amongst those higher in intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Calvin et al., 2017)</ref>; and common genetic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arden et al., 2016)</ref>. To test this assumption, we looked at the correlation between forecast errors and the polygenic scores for IQ and educational attainment described in Section 2.4. Whilst the unconditional forecast error is positively correlated with both the polygenic score for IQ ( = 0.037, &lt; 0.001) and educational attainment ( = 0.060, &lt; 0.001), these small correlations became statistically insignificant and approximately zero when using our residualized forecast error measure. As an additional test, we looked at the correlation between forecast errors and the polygenic scores for both longevity and parental death (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ajnakina &amp; Steptoe (2022)</ref> for further information regarding the derivation of these polygenic scores in ELSA). Whilst the unconditional forecast error is positively correlated with both longevity ( = 0.025, &lt; 0.001) and parental death ( = 0.054, &lt; 0.001) polygenic scores, these small correlations became negative and approximately zero when using our residualized forecast error measure.</p><p>participants were asked to remember two things. The first is remembering to do a task, which required participants, when handed a clipboard and a pencil by the interviewer, to write their initials on the top left-hand corner of the piece of paper attached to the clipboard. For the second task participants were asked to remind the interviewer, at the end of the memory and concentration tasks, to record what time we finish the tasks. The final score is based on accuracy of completing the tasks and whether or not the participants required prompting. The fourth task assessed practical numerical knowledge or numerical ability. Participants were asked in Waves 1 and 4, and refreshments samples in Waves 6-9, up to five questions that were graded in complexity. Based on performance on the first three items, participants can get two additional (more difficult) questions or one additional (simpler) question. The types of questions asked, included: "A second hand car dealer is selling a car for £6,000. This is two thirds of what it cost new. How much did the car cost new?" and "If 5 people all have the winning numbers in the lottery and the prize is £2 million, how much will each of them get?".</p><p>The final score is based on a simple count of number of correct items. The fifth task assessed respondents' executive function, using a counting backwards task. Specifically, in Waves 7-9, participants were asked to count backward as quickly as they can from 20. The final score is binary, where correct responses included counting down from 19 to 10 or from 20 to 11. The sixth task assessed respondents' executive function, using an object naming task. The naming task was conducted in Waves 7-9, and participants were asked a series of five questions which required participants to name people or objects. The type of questions asked included: "What do you call the kind of prickly plant that grows in the desert?" and "Who is the reigning monarch now?". The final score is based on a simple count of number of correct items. The seventh task assessed respondents' executive function, using the Serial 7's subtraction task.</p><p>Specifically, in Waves 7-9, participants were asked to give the correct answer to a series of subtraction questions. Starting at 100, the interviewer asked the respondent to subtract 7. At the next question, the respondent is asked to subtract 7 again, and so on. There is a sequence of five subtractions. The number of correct responses out of a maximum of five was recorded.</p><p>The eighth task assessed semantic verbal fluency, using a word-find task. Specifically, in all Waves except Wave 6, participants were given one minute to name as many animals as possible. The final score on this item is based upon the number of unique correct responses.</p><p>The ninth task assessed accuracy and speed of mental processing using a letter cancellation task. Specifically, in Waves 1-5, participants were asked to work through a list, crossing out all the P's and W's. Participants were asked to start at the top left-hand corner of the list and work along each line of the list sequentially, as if they were reading a page. Participants were asked to work as quickly and as accurately as they could, until the computer says stop. At this point, participants were asked to underline the last letter on which they finished. This task produces two scores. The first is the number of P's and W's crossed out and the second is based on the number of P's and W's missed out by the participant prior to the underlined last letter.</p><p>The tenth task assessed fluid intelligence or the ability to use abstract thought to solve novel problems, using a number series task. Specifically, in Waves 6, 8 and 9, participants were asked to write down a number sequence, as read by the interviewer. The number series consists of several numbers with a blank number in the series. The respondent is asked which number goes in the blank. Respondents were given two sets of three number sequences, where the difficulty of the second set was determined by performance in the first set. The final score is based on the correct responses from the two sets of questions, whilst accounting for the difficulty level of the second set of problems. The final task is a literacy task. Specifically, in Waves 2 and 5, and refreshments samples in Waves 6-9, and for refreshment samples, participants are asked to read a medicine label and answer four questions about what it says. Participants did not have to memorise the card, as they were able to look at it while answering the questions. The type of questions asked included: "What is the maximum number of days you may take this medicine?" and "list three situations for which you should consult a doctor". The final score is based on a simple count of number of correct items.</p><p>From these twelve cognitive function scores, we created a general IQ factor (i.e., composite score) which we refer to as 'Phenotypic IQ'. This composite measure standardizes and then combines respondent's average scores-as individuals may take each cognitive task more than once-from each of the cognitive tasks. The level of internal consistency across the items appears to be high: Cronbach's alpha is 0.78 (average interitem correlation of 0.23).</p></div>

In the data, individuals with higher polygenic scores for IQ tend to have higher phenotypic IQ ( = 0.198, &lt; 0.001) and those with higher polygenic scores for educational attainment also tend to have higher phenotypic IQ ( = 0.169, &lt; 0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figures 1 and 2 describes the relationship between phenotypic IQ, PGS IQ, PGS EA</head><p>and forecasting errors. The binned scatterplots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> groups the x-axis variable (forecast error) into 50 equal-sized bins and then computes the mean of the y-axis variable (phenotypic IQ, PGS IQ and PGS EA) within each bin, then creates a scatterplot of these data points. Here, the forecast error is measured net of the influence of age and target age; lifestyle factors; subjective health; objective health and differences in genetic longevity. In Panels A-C of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure   1</ref>, the mean phenotypic IQ, PGS IQ and PGS EA peaks when forecast errors are close to zero and falls symmetrically for both pessimistic and optimistic forecast errors. Following this observation, and as an inferential test, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> plots the average absolute forecast error across deciles (i.e., 10 equal-sized bins) of phenotypic IQ, PGS IQ and PGS EA. In Panel A, absolute forecast errors decrease monotonically with phenotypic IQ. The absolute forecast error for agents with the lowest cognitive abilities is almost 10 percentage points higher than those with the lowest cognitive abilities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Control variables</head><p>We include a number of control variables that may explain the association between intelligence and forecasting calibration. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table S3</ref> of the Supplemental Material presents an overview of the sample characteristics. Firstly, we include controls for sex and age which are exogenous.</p><p>Secondly, we add controls for educational attainment and logarithm of net wealth (the sum of savings, investments, physical wealth and housing wealth after financial debt and mortgage debt has been subtracted household net wealth). These additional covariates could in principle have been affected by intelligence. Indeed, intelligence has been identified as the major source of variation in educational attainment <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lynn &amp; Mikk, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Ritchie &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2018</ref>) and</p><p>wealth <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Meisenberg, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Smith et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Strenze, 2007)</ref>, factors which may be related to greater exposure to information or more normative models of human judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Stanovich &amp; West, 1998)</ref>. In addition, poverty itself, via poverty-related concerns, can reduce cognitive capacity and lead to poorer decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir &amp; Zhao, 2013)</ref>. Including these variables therefore blocks the potentially important indirect paths and therefore allows us to isolate the direct relationship between intelligence and calibration <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cinelli, Forney &amp; Pearl, 2022)</ref>. Thirdly, when using polygenic scores for intelligence, rather than phenotypic IQ in our analytic strategy, following Barth, Papageorge and Thom (2020) and Papageorge and Thom (2020), we add controls to capture parental environment, which includes mother and fathers' education and main care givers occupation. Whilst these controls are legitimate sources of variance in intelligence for predictive models, in casual models such as Mendelian randomization (MR), the parental environment would be viewed as a confound that needs to be controlled for <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Plomin &amp; von Stumm, 2022)</ref>. For instance, genes, whilst fixed at conception, are determined by parental genes, which also affect the childhood environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kong et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Young et al., 2018)</ref>. In short, a possible gene-environment correlation in our setting is that a higher PGS for IQ is associated with more calibrated forecasts through advantageous parental environments. Indeed, <ref type="bibr">Krapohl et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Analytic Strategy</head><p>The first step of our analysis is to estimate the relationship between phenotypic IQ and the absolute value of forecasting errors. As we measure forecasting errors on a repeated basis, we assessed a pooled sample (i.e., combining observations from multiple Waves into a single sample) which allowed estimation of the relationship between phenotypic IQ and repeated   <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Silva &amp; Tenreyro, 2006)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">| | = + ℎ + ∑<label>(2)</label></formula><p>As with the majority of observational studies, the estimate of interest, , from Equation</p><p>(2) identifies an association, rather than a causal link between IQ and forecasting errors. For instance, the estimate may be affected by unobserved confounding or omitted variable bias, measurement error, reverse causation, or simultaneity. Whilst randomized control trials <ref type="bibr">(RCTs)</ref> are seen as the gold standard for causal inference, instrumental variables (IVs) allow for the possibility of causal inference in observational studies by controlling for unobserved confounding and measurement error. Here, we employ Mendelian randomization (MR), a special case of IV analysis which is based upon leveraging genetic variation. In our setting, the PGS for IQ is used as an instrumental variable for phenotypic IQ. By the Mendelian laws, alleles of SNPs segregate and are randomly inherited by offspring from parents. This principle is analogous to the randomized treatment assignment in RCTs, which result in an unconfounded exposure-outcome relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Teumer, 2018)</ref>. Identification in IV estimation requires (a) relevance: that the instrument is associated with the endogenous regressors, (b)</p><p>independence: there must be no unmeasured confounders linking the IV with the outcome, and (c) exclusion restriction: that the IV can only affect the outcome via its effect on the endogenous regressor. The final two criteria for IV identification are often referred to jointly as IV validity.</p><p>As described earlier, good evidence of IV relevance is provided by the correlation between PGSs for IQ and phenotypic IQ ( = 0.198, &lt; 0.001). However, IV validity is in our setting could be invalidated by dynastic effects-whereby the expression of the parental genotype in the parent' phenotype directly effects the outcome variable. For instance, the genotypes of the offspring will be correlated with that of their parents, which also affect the childhood environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kong et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pingault et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Young et al., 2018)</ref>. If parental phenotypic IQ affects forecasting errors, perhaps because higher IQ parents encourage their offspring to engage in information search and normative thinking models <ref type="bibr">(Krapohl et al., 2017)</ref> then the effects of parental IQ on offspring forecasting errors will be ignored and attributed to the offspring's IQ. For this reason, we include, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barth, Papageorge and Thom (2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Papageorge and Thom (2020)</ref>, our controls for parental environment in the MR estimation strategy. In the same view, we also include controls for population stratification to account for any ancestry differences in genetic structures as measured by 10 principal components. Indeed, within observational studies, IV validity occurs only reasonably when controlling for further covariates <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Angrist &amp; Pischke, 2009)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head><p>Tables 2 and 3 report the main findings. As our parameters are estimated via Poisson regression, we report semi-elasticities, that is, a percentage change in the absolute value of forecast errors in terms of a one standard deviation change in our cognitive variables of interest.</p><p>We consider our estimates across nested models. We begin by discussing the estimated relationship between phenotypic IQ and forecast errors as reported in Columns 1 and 2 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table   2</ref>.</p><p>In Column 1, we estimated the relationship between phenotypic IQ and forecast errors controlling for our exogenous regressors (i.e., age and sex  <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lynn &amp; Mikk, 2009)</ref>, the estimates are smaller but similar to those presented in Column 1.</p><p>Columns 3, 4, and 5 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref> report the causal estimates of IQ and forecast errors from our Mendelian randomization (MR) procedure. We refer to the MR estimate of the effect of IQ on forecast error as the effect of "genotypic IQ," as opposed to the effect of "phenotypic IQ" obtained without using an instrument. The results have an intuitive interpretation, specifically, a percentage change in the absolute value of forecast errors for a one standard deviation increase in IQ caused by variation in the PGS IQ. In Column 3, we estimated the causal relationship between IQ and forecast errors controlling for our exogenous regressors.</p><p>Here, a one standard deviation change in IQ increases forecast errors by 19.4%. Alternatively, low-IQ have a predicted forecast error of 26.37, while high-IQ have a predicted forecast error of 12.13. These effects are larger than those using phenotypic IQ, directly. Indeed, instrumental variables analysis tends to produce larger estimates by eliminating unobserved confounding, measurement error and lastly, heterogeneity in the studied population <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Card, 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Card, , 2001</ref>). In Columns 4 and 5 we included controls for educational attainment, wealth and parental environment, although these covariates have little effect on the estimate of interest.</p><p>We test the relevancy requirements of our MR estimation, by analysing the first-stage Fstatistics from the control function approach to IV Poisson estimation. Our instrument is found to be relevant as all first-stage F-statistics are above 10. Moreover, the coefficient estimate of the control function provides a Hausman test of the null hypothesis that phenotypic IQ is exogenous <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Wooldridge, 2015)</ref>. That the estimated coefficient estimate on the control function variable is significantly different from zero suggests that phenotypic IQ is endogenous. 18 Notes: Columns 1 and 2 are estimates from Poisson regression. Columns 3, 4 and 5 are estimates from instrumental variable (IV) Poisson regression, using a Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimator. Main entries are semi-elasticities, t-statistics using clustered standard errors by the individual in brackets. Age is included in quadratic form. Education is measured as a set of binary variables indicating the highest level of attainment. These binary variables include university or college degree -either at undergraduate or postgraduate level and includes National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ's: practical work-based awards) at Level 4 (Higher Education Certificate) and Level 5 (Higher Education Diploma/Foundation Degree); Higher national certificates and diplomas below degree level -which includes diplomas in higher education, teaching qualifications, nursing or other medical qualifications; A-level -which are post-compulsory examinations taken at 18 to qualify for college or university entrance and includes NVQ's at Level 3; GCSE standard -which are a standard pass (Grades 9-4) in schooling attainment qualifications taken at 16 and includes NVQ's at Level 2; GCSE -which are a low pass (Grades 3-1) in schooling attainment qualifications taken at 16 and includes NVQ's at Level 1; other qualification -which includes school leaving exam certificate or matriculation; and lastly, no formal qualifications. Net wealth is the logarithm of net total household wealth (the sum of savings, investments, physical wealth and housing wealth after financial debt and mortgage debt has been subtracted). Parental environment controls include mother and father's education and main carer's main occupation when respondent was 14. Mother and father's education are measured as a set of binary variables indicating when the parent left full-time education. These binary variables include missing response; never went to school; 14 or under; at 15; at 16; at 17; at 18; and lastly, 19 or over. Main carer's main occupation when respondent was 14 is again measured as a set of binary variables. These binary variables include armed forces; manager or senior official; running own business; professional or technical; administrative, clerical or secretarial; skilled trade; caring, leisure, travel or personal services; sales or customer service; plant, process or machine drivers; other jobs; something else; casual jobs; retired; unemployed; and lastly, sick / disabled. Significance levels *** 1%,** 5%, * 10%. <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 3</ref> reports semi-elasticities, in terms of a one standard deviation change in the PGS for educational attainment. Again, we consider our estimates across nested models. In Column 1, we estimated the relationship between PGS EA and forecast errors controlling for our exogenous regressors (i.e., age and sex). Here, a one standard deviation change in the polygenic score increases forecast errors by 4.6%. Alternatively, low-IQ (-2 standard deviations from the mean) have a predicted forecast error of 19.95, while high-IQ (+2 standard deviations from the mean) have a predicted forecast error of 16.59. In Column 2, we add controls for educational attainment and wealth, which reduces the size of the point estimates, as does the inclusion of parental environment controls in Column 3, and phenotypic IQ in Column 4. Although all estimates remain significantly different from zero. The results in Column 4 suggests that part of the PGS EA explanatory power comes from non-cognitive traits. These effects are much smaller than those presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref>. Indeed, these are likely a conservative quantification of the genetic effects as estimation error in the GWAS summary statistics (e.g., betas,values), will lead to measurement error in the polygenic scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gong, Li, Su &amp; Zhang, 2024)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Robustness</head><p>We carried out a barrage of robustness checks. In short, whatever we threw at the estimation, the results remained stable. Firstly, we analysed whether the results described in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 2 and   3</ref> held for positive and negative forecasting errors evaluated separately. For instance, although forecast errors are measured net of lifestyle factors, health, and genetic longevity there may still be possible confounding from the positive intelligence-lifespan relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Whalley &amp; Deary, 2001</ref>). However, the results in Tables S4 and S5 of the Supplemental Material suggest that the link between low IQ, low PGS EA and forecasting errors is moderately larger for optimistic forecasting errors than for pessimistic forecasting errors. For illustrative purposes, we repeat the MR analysis in Column 5 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Table S4 (which includes controls</ref>   Note. The forecast error from which the bins are generated, is measured net of the influence of age and target age; lifestyle factors; subjective health; objective health and differences in genetic longevity. Panel A (B) is for bins of positive (negative) forecast errors. High (low)-IQ are those +2 (-2) standard deviations from the mean. Vertical lines represent 95% confidence intervals around the predicted probability for each bin. Sample of 3,946 individuals with 30,120 person-Wave observations. %pt = percentage point.</p><p>Secondly, we analysed whether the relationship between IQ and forecasting errors could be explained by low-IQ respondents being more likely to choose focal points when evaluating their subjective survival probabilities. Indeed, spikes at focal points of 0, 0.5 and 1 are common in subjective probability data (Bruine de Bruin &amp; Carman, 2018; d <ref type="bibr">'Uva, O'Donnell &amp; Van Doorslaer, 2020)</ref>. In this view, as a robustness check, we repeat the analysis presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref> and 3, including a further set of controls that capture the use of focal points.</p><p>Specifically, focal point controls are three dichotomous variables that equal zero if the respondent didn't use a focal point or equal to one for the use of focal points 0, 0.5 and 1. The results of this procedure are reported in Tables S6 and S7 of the Supplemental Material.</p><p>Thirdly, we repeated the analysis presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 2</ref> using a larger sample of respondents, by relaxing the construction of phenotypic IQ to include all those respondents who had valid responses to at least one of the cognitive function tasks. The results of this procedure are reported in <ref type="table">Table S8</ref> of the Supplemental Material.</p><p>Fourthly, we estimate the relationship between IQ and forecasting errors, using the logarithm of the absolute value of forecasting errors as our dependent variable and estimating <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 2 and 3</ref>  Finally, as we analyzed an unbalanced panel, individuals differed in the number of Waves in which we observed their forecasting errors. This means that for some individuals we measured their forecasting errors with less precision. To mitigate these concerns, we repeated the main analysis, but restricting our sample to only those individuals who were observed in all 9 Waves. While this procedure may have introduced some survivorship bias, the results are wholly consistent with those reported in the main text (see Tables S11 and S12 of the Supplemental Material).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">IQ and noise in forecast errors</head><p>We have provided evidence that low-IQ is an important determinant of forecasting errors, that is, larger deviations in respondent's probability assessment from the statistically derived true expected value. As discussed in the Section 3 (i.e., the Analytic Strategy section) forecasting errors can arise from information advantages, systematic mistakes or unsystematic mistakes.</p><p>In this section we address whether low-IQ agents forecasts are noisier (e.g., exhibiting a greater variability in the accuracy of probability assessments when asked for repeated estimates of the same event). This is important. For instance, whilst systematically miscalibrated probability estimates, within normatively correct decision-making processes, will always be costly, noise suggests a person who is asked to repeat the same decision, will be biased on some presentations, and may not be biased on others.</p><p>In answering this question, we replicate the analysis in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Tables 2 and 3, but</ref>  </p><formula xml:id="formula_5">= √ 1 ∑ ( * − * ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅ ) 2 =1<label>(4)</label></formula><p>As each individual has one estimate of the standard deviation, our subsequent analysis is conducted on one-observation per individual.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">General Discussion</head><p>We find that low-IQ is associated with substantial forecasting errors in the context of subjective survival expectations-a key input in household consumption, investments, retirement, annuities, and savings decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hurd, Smith &amp; Zissimopoulos, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Inkmann, Lopes &amp; Michaelides, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Salm, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Spaenjers &amp; Spira, 2015)</ref>. The effects are not small.</p><p>Our causal estimates suggest a one standard deviation change in IQ increases forecast errors by 19.4%. Not only this, forecasting errors also depend directly on the genetic variants associated with educational attainment-that captures intelligence and other cognitive and noncognitive traits-providing tentative evidence that people may be born to be biased. In our data, there are three mutually inclusive reasons why expectations may be wrong. The first possibility stems from differences in forecaster's information quality, the second from systematic mistakes or bias (e.g., people are always inaccurate) and the third possibility, noise (unsystematic mistakes, e.g., higher variability in the accuracy of probability assessments when asked for repeated estimates of the same event). Whilst our results speak to the net effects of these theoretical channels, we do provide additional evidence that low-IQ respondents produce more noise in their probability estimates. It is left for future research to decompose low-IQ forecaster's inaccuracies into its information, noise, and bias components. However, our results suggest noise is likely to be non-negligible contributor, which resonates with Daniel Kahneman's sentiment: 2 "Now, it's hard to say what there is more of, noise or bias. But one thing is very certain-that bias has been overestimated at the expense of noise. Virtually all the literature and a lot of public conversation is about biases. But in fact, noise is, I think, extremely important, very prevalent."</p><p>Our study does of course have some limitations. Specifically, like most Mendelian randomization (MR) studies, ours involved analyses of unrelated, independent sets of respondents. These studies assume that the exclusion restriction and independence criteria hold due to Mendelian randomization. However, one may argue that Mendelian randomization holds conditional on family fixed-effects, but not across independent sets of respondents. For instance, across unrelated respondents' causal estimates from MR studies can be biased due to (a) dynastic effects, and (b) population stratification. Firstly, dynastic effects-whereby the expression of the parental genotype in the parent' phenotype directly effects the outcome variable-in our setting could emerge if parental IQ affects forecasting errors, perhaps because high-IQ parents encourage their offspring to engage in information search and normative thinking models. As the genotypes of the offspring will be correlated with that of their parents, and if the MR estimation is conducted on a sample of unrelated respondents, the effects of parental IQ on offspring forecasting errors will be ignored and attributed to the offspring's IQ. Reassuringly, our results are robust to controlling for the parental environment, using controls for the education of both the respondent's parents, as well as the occupation of the main care giver when the respondent was 14. Indeed, and important for our context of participants aged over 50, research suggests that after adolescence, the effect of the shared family environment on intelligence is negligible <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Briley &amp; Tucker-Drob, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Plomin &amp; Daniels, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Plomin &amp; von Stumm, 2018)</ref>. Familial similarities for intelligence in the long run are therefore due to nature, rather than nurture <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Plomin &amp; Von Stumm, 2018)</ref>. Secondly, population stratification-whereby an SNP variant is more common in a specific ancestry group-could emerge in our setting if cultural norms confound the association between the IV and the outcome. Here, we include controls for population stratification to account for any ancestry differences in genetic structures as measured by 10 principal components. However, it is of course possible that the principal components may not completely control for all 2 Interview with Tyler Cowen at George Mason University (November 12, 2018), https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/tyler-cowen-daniel-kahneman-economics-bias-noise-167275de691f.</p><p>ancestry differences and in the same way, that our parental controls do not fully capture the parental environment.

For instance, where within-sibling variation in polygenic scores is leveraged or controlling for the genes of the respondent's parents.

As a result, inaccurate probabilistic expectations are costly. Our finding that low-IQ respondents are poorly calibrated to probability distributions suggests an important channel through which low-IQ is related to suboptimal decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agarwal &amp; Mazumder, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Grinblatt, Ikäheimo, Keloharju &amp; Knüpfer, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Grinblatt, Keloharju, &amp; Linnainmaa, 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">, 2012</ref> and to lower economic growth and welfare <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hafer, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer &amp; Miller, 2004)</ref>. However, this does require human behavior to be captured adequately by normative models of decision making and for low-IQ agents to be unsophisticated about their errors in probabilistic assessments. Whilst general intelligence is a powerful predictor of success <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Zagorsky, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Zax &amp; Rees, 2002)</ref> further research should examine whether probability calibration is associated with success over and above the effect of intelligence. This seems plausible given that standard measures of intelligence are often criticized for assessing individual performance in simple tasks, but not in more complex task and in more complex environments. Indeed, our measure of forecast error is conceptually distinct from typically intelligence measures and perhaps more properly regarded as a component of rational thinking, or more specifically, epistemic irrationality, of which incoherent probability assessments are an important aspect (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Baron, 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, our findings present an alternate channel for the evidence linking the increased incidence of judgemental biases in human judgements (i.e., judgements that depart from basic principles of probability) amongst those low in intelligence <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Benjamin, Brown &amp; Shapiro, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bruine de Bruin, Parker &amp; Fischhoff, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Frederick, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hoppe &amp; Kusterer, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Oechssler, Roider &amp; Schmitz, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Stanovich &amp; West, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Toplak, West &amp; Stanovich, 2011)</ref>.

Those low in IQ are typically regarded as less able to override the heuristic system-and therefore an inappropriate heuristic response-and engage System 2, where reasoning is deliberative, logical, and analytical <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Stanovich &amp; West, 2008)</ref>. Our findings suggest low-IQ agents may actively rely more on heuristics if they are sophisticated about their errors in probabilistic assessments. In this view, low-IQ agents may also rely more on non-probabilistic behaviour, where affect and emotions can be the primary drivers of decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, &amp; Welch, 2001</ref>).</p><p>Our findings regarding the greater incidence of noise amongst low-IQ agents is important for research that has investigated the relationship between cognitive abilities and other psychological traits and preferences. Consider for example the documented positive relationship between intelligence and risk seeking behaviour (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Dohmen, Falk, Huffman &amp; Sunde, 2018)</ref> into normative decision-making frameworks. Low-IQ agents may also rely more heavily on heuristics that reduce information-processing load, and which lead to systematic errors in judgement. Or low-IQ agents may be more susceptible to noise. All we can say is that there are likely to be causal pathways not mediated by education, wealth and the observable parental environment. Whilst it seems realistic to expect that people act on their systematic mistakes.</p><p>For instance, research has also shown that when people make forecasting errors, then these errors can impact real economic activity through its impact on important household consumption and investment decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Caliendo &amp; Huang, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Claus &amp; Nguyen, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Puri and Robinson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Sandroni &amp; Squintani, 2013)</ref>. It is more difficult to ascertain whether people act upon the noise, that is, the unsystematic mistakes in their expectations? However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Juodis and Kučinskas (2023)</ref> suggest this is possible as household investment decisions have been found to be dependent on, for instance, house price fluctuations experienced by their geographically distant friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bailey, Cao, Kuchler &amp; Stroebel, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Lastly, it would seem natural to conclude that poor calibration will be unimportant for decisions made by high-IQ agents, or indeed, in markets where participants are likely to be high in intelligence. However, even our high-IQ agents display significant forecasting errors.

For instance it is often associated with cognitive functions, such as learning, neural function, cognitive development and regions of the brain associate with language, memory, visual recognition and cognitive processing (Belsky et al., 2016</figDesc></figure>

The error hypothesis rejects this systematic link and instead posits that cognitive ability is associated to risk preferences via bias of the architectural properties of most risk-preference elicitation task and importantly, the confounding association between cognitive abilities and the probability of making unsystematic decision errors (for a review and meta-analysis of these competing hypothesis, see Mechera-Ostrovsky, Heinke, Andraszewicz &amp; Rieskamp, 2022). As discussed, it is an open question why IQ is linked to a higher incidence of forecasting errors. For instance, as in D'Acunto et al.

Importantly, as we have measured forecast errors net of the influence of age and target age; lifestyle factors; subjective health; objective health and differences in genetic longevity, individual differences in forecasting accuracy will now capture differences in forecaster's information sets, systematic mistakes (i.e., bias) and random, unsystematic mistakes (i.e., noise).

Columns 3, 4 and 5 are estimates from instrumental variable (IV) Poisson regression, using a Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimator. In Panel A (B) the dependent variable is the absolute value of positive (negative) forecast errors. Main entries are semi-elasticities, t-statistics using clustered standard errors by the individual in brackets. Age is included in quadratic form. Education is measured as a set of binary variables indicating the highest level of attainment. These binary variables include university or college degree -either at undergraduate or postgraduate level and includes National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ's: practical work-based awards) at Level 4 (Higher Education Certificate) and Level 5 (Higher Education Diploma/Foundation Degree); Higher national certificates and diplomas below degree level -which includes diplomas in higher education, teaching qualifications, nursing or other medical qualifications; A-level -which are post-compulsory examinations taken at 18 to qualify for college or university entrance and includes NVQ's at Level 3; GCSE standard -which are a standard pass (Grades 9-4) in schooling attainment qualifications taken at 16 and includes NVQ's at Level 2; GCSE -which are a low pass (Grades 3-1) in schooling attainment qualifications taken at 16 and includes NVQ's at Level 1; other qualification -which includes school leaving exam certificate or matriculation; and lastly, no formal qualifications. Net wealth is the logarithm of net total household wealth (the sum of savings, investments, physical wealth and housing wealth after financial debt and mortgage debt has been subtracted). Parental environment controls include mother and father's education and main carer's main occupation when respondent was 14. Mother and father's education are measured as a set of binary variables indicating when the parent left full-time education. These binary variables include missing response; never went to school; 14 or under; at 15; at 16; at 17; at 18; and lastly, 19 or over. Main carer's main occupation when respondent was 14 is again measured as a set of binary variables. These binary variables include armed forces; manager or senior official; running own business; professional or technical; administrative, clerical or secretarial; skilled trade; caring, leisure, travel or personal services; sales or customer service; plant, process or machine drivers; other jobs; something else; casual jobs; retired; unemployed; and lastly, sick / disabled. Significance levels *** 1%,** 5%, * 10%. 18 Notes: Columns 1 and 2 are estimates from Poisson regression. Columns 3, 4 and 5 are estimates from instrumental variable (IV) Poisson regression, using a Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) estimator. Focal point controls are three dichotomous variables that equal zero if the respondent didn't use a focal point or equal to one for the use of focal points 0, 0.5 and 1. See the description in the <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> caption for further information about the control variables. Main entries are semi-elasticities, t-statistics using clustered standard errors by the individual in brackets. Significance levels *** 1%,** 5%, * 10%. 18 Notes: Poisson regressions.
