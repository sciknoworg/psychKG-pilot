			<abstract>
				<p>In this retrospective honoring the exemplary psychologist Daniel Kahneman (1934-2024), we present a curated selection of quotes from the academic community reflecting on his ideas. These submissions, gathered from a wide range of scholars, highlight Kahneman&apos;s contributions to fields spanning attention, judgment, decision-making, and well-being. From his exploration of cognitive biases to his ground breaking work on prospect theory, Kahneman&apos;s research revolutionized our understanding of human behavior and decision-making. Beyond his research, many of the quotes also emphasize Kahneman&apos;s thoughts on what it means to be a behavioral scientist-focusing on a commitment to criticism, transparency, and adversarial collaboration; showcasing the dynamic nature of scientific inquiry across disciplinary divides; and highlighting his dedication to advancing the greater good. Together, these reflections paint a portrait of a visionary thinker whose theoretical and meta-scientific contributions have left an indelible mark on psychology and other social sciences. Author note: This collection article was proposed and implemented by Brett Buttliere and directed by the editor Igor Grossmann. The contributors are listed in alphabetical order. Contributions were publicly invited and selected by the editor, based on votes of anonymized submissions by the Editorial Board of Psychological Inquiry.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>3 "I hope that more efficient procedures for the conduct of controversies will be part of my legacy." <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman &amp; Smith,</ref><ref type="bibr">n.d.,</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 1)</ref>.</p><p>To me, Professor Kahneman's advocacy for "adversarial collaboration" stands out as one of his most notable and impactful contributions to science. It stands as a refreshing departure from what he aptly terms "angry science", where opposing scholars engage in a competitive spectacle aimed at scoring points and undermining each other. Instead, adversarial collaboration promotes constructive discussion and cooperation among adversaries in the face of academic controversies, guiding them toward a shared pursuit of truth.</p><p>At its core, this approach rests on three principles: first, a dedication to articulating each other's perspectives in good faith; second, a joint effort to design studies that fairly test competing ideas; and third, a commitment to publishing the results regardless of the outcome. By necessitating the rigorous testing of hypotheses and transparency, adversarial collaboration reduces blind spots, mitigates biases, and curtails questionable research practices. In doing so, it advances scientific inquiry, yielding more reliable and robust insights for all involved.</p><p>Over the years, Professor Kahneman has engaged in adversarial collaborations with some of his fiercest opponents. Collaborations like those with Gary Klein have yielded nuanced insights into the boundary conditions of intuitive expertise, while others presented more challenges. Yet, even in cases where consensus was not achieved, these collaborations have sparked enriching discussions and contributed to scientific knowledge.</p><p>In an era marked by escalating polarization and dwindling civility, the significance of adversarial collaboration is more pertinent than ever. By transcending theoretical divides and fostering constructive engagement, it serves as a beacon of hope for the advancement of science <ref type="bibr">KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 4</ref> and the pursuit of truth. It is no surprise that Professor Kahneman, amidst his immense contributions, envisions adversarial collaboration as part of his illustrious legacy.</p><p>Submitted by Qiao Kang Teo, Department of Psychology, National University of Singapore, Singapore "The unusually high openness to scrutiny may be annoying and even offensive, but it is a small price to pay for the big prize of restored credibility" <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman, 2012, p.1)</ref> Embarking on an academic career, many of us dream of contributing to society and effecting positive change, inspired by luminaries like Newton and Einstein. These figures stand as monumental heroes, symbols of what we aspire to achieve. Their stories, not just their discoveries, fuel our ambition and pride in our work. Yet, when our research faces intense scrutiny, it can feel like a personal affront, threatening the very pride we've cultivated in our achievements.</p><p>Kahneman's perspective offers a transformative realization: it's not the individual, but their contributions to the collective knowledge that truly matter. Newton and Einstein are revered not merely for their personas but for how their work propelled humanity forward, offering us a deeper understanding of the universe. Their legacy is not in their fame but in the societal advancements their discoveries enabled, reminding us that science thrives on collective progress rather than individual recognition. This realization demands we detach from our work. Accepting that our theories might be eclipsed by better ones is not a defeat but a contribution to the greater body of knowledge. In this process, the ego takes a backseat to the pursuit of truth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 5</head><p>Kahneman also highlights the critical role of credibility in science. Our contributions gain significance only when the public, from the average Joe to Yehor and Chen, trusts in their validity. The pandemic starkly illustrated this; despite the swift development of vaccines, scepticism prevailed among many. To counter this, a portion of our ego must be sacrificed for the greater good, emphasizing that detachment from personal accolades is crucial for fostering trust and advancing society.</p><p>Submitted by Michał Białek, Institute of Psychology, University of Wrcoław, Poland "I call it theory-induced blindness: once you have accepted a theory and used it as a tool in your thinking, it is extraordinarily difficult to notice its flaws. If you come upon an observation that does not seem to fit the model, you assume that there must be a perfectly good explanation that you are somehow missing" <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman, 2011, p. 277)</ref>.</p><p>Thanks to Kahneman's work, we may have come to terms with our own cognitive biases.</p><p>However, it is still disquieting when one considers the extent of their impact on science.</p><p>Consider the replication crisis: we were slow to acknowledge that our methods had flaws, and, even today, replication efforts remain poorly incentivized. We excel at coming up with justifications for our findings rather than questioning them. We tend to think, "there must be a reason they can't be reproduced, but the effect still exists." Combine this with overconfidence and confirmation bias, and you have a recipe for extremely stubborn minds that overlook evidence more rational minds would not. <ref type="bibr">KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 6</ref> Initially met with lukewarm reception by psychologists and outright coldness by economists, Prospect Theory nowadays commands the respect that comes with a Nobel Prize.</p><p>Economists are finally listening to behavioral scientists. However, despite hard-to-ignore evidence, it took years for the acceptance that expected utility theory might not accurately describe human behavior. We scientists must admit that we are reluctant to embrace change and update our beliefs. All of this makes scientific progress slow.</p><p>Scholars are now identifying flaws in Prospect Theory. Sufficient time has passed for it to stir theory-induced blindness too, and I wonder if we will fall victim to the same cognitive biases. What makes me hopeful is that behavioral economics is a field born from challenging pre-existing theories. Could this be optimism bias? Perhaps. Yet, even Kahneman, a natural pessimist, has acknowledged that optimism takes you places too.</p><p>Submitted by Ángela Jiang-Wang, Luxembourg Institute of Socio-Economic Research (LISER),</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Luxembourg.</head><p>""This true story [about flight instructor] illustrates a saddening aspect of the human condition.</p><p>We normally reinforce others when their behavior is good and punish them when their behavior is bad. By regression alone, therefore, they are most likely to improve after being punished and most likely to deteriorate after being rewarded. Consequently, we are exposed to a lifetime schedule in which we are most often rewarded for punishing others, and punished for rewarding." <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman &amp;Tversky, 1973, p. 251)</ref> KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 7 Kahneman and Tversky's 1973 paper not only challenges intuitive predictions with the representativeness heuristic but also illuminates the common oversight of regression-to-the-mean, a principle vividly illustrated through Kahneman's conversation with a flight instructor. This concept, while statistically fundamental, reveals unsettling truths about human judgment and superstitious learning.</p><p>The implications of ignoring regression-to-the-mean are widespread and documented in subsequent studies. For instance, firms celebrating their leaders as 'Best CEOs' often witness a decline in performance following their accolades. Sports teams that replace their coaches due to poor performance frequently see an uptick. The performance changes are not necessarily due to CEOs becoming complacent or new coaches saving the day but to statistical regression from high or low performances.</p><p>Despite compelling evidence, the allure of causal narratives often overshadows regression-to-the-mean. This tendency to seek explanations beyond randomness reflects a deep-seated human need, even in the face of contrary evidence. However, the increasing interest in regression-to-the-mean, according to Google Trend, notably since Kahneman's "Thinking, Fast and Slow," suggests a growing appreciation for statistical principles in understanding human behavior and decision-making. This gradual shift towards acknowledging statistical regression's role offers hope for more informed interpretations of success, failure, and the dynamics of change. The power of the idea prevails over the regression of regression-to-the-mean.</p><p>Submitted by Chengwei Liu, Imperial College London, UK KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 8 "The illusion that we understand the past fosters overconfidence in our ability to predict the future" <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman, 2011, p. 212)</ref>.</p><p>Daniel Kahneman holds the title of being my "academic grandfather." I had the honor of being supervised during my doctoral thesis by Bradley Ruffle, who was mentored by Kahneman during his time at Princeton University. The extent of Kahneman's impact on research can be measured by the multitude of citations his work has garnered. Google Scholar records indicate that his papers and books have been cited a total of 530,146 times over the years.</p><p>One of the concepts emphasized in Kahneman's research is overconfidence.</p><p>Overconfidence may appear as a trivial and insignificant human weakness. Nonetheless, this quote from Kahneman's book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" underscores the significance of this concept: "The illusion that we understand the past fosters overconfidence in our ability to predict the future".</p><p>Before the research conducted by Kahneman and his co-author Amos Tversky, economic models were predicated on the assumption of "rational actors," meaning that individuals' financial decisions were believed to be made rationally to maximize personal profits as much as possible. Kahneman and Tversky demonstrated that this assumption is not entirely accurate and that various influences, sometimes challenging to predict, play a role in our decisions.</p><p>Another example is provided by economic forecasts, which frequently depend on historical economic data and models to anticipate future economic conditions, covering aspects such as GDP growth, inflation rates, and unemployment levels. Relying excessively on past economic trends can lead to overly optimistic or pessimistic forecasts, potentially resulting in policy errors and missed opportunities for intervention.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 9</head><p>Submitted by Zeev Shtudiner, Economics and Business Administration Department, Ariel University, Ariel, Israel "The affect heuristic is an instance of substitution, in which the answer to an easy question (How do I feel about it?) serves as an answer to a much harder question (What do I think about it?)" <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman, 2011, p. 1</ref>).</p><p>Affect and emotion were central to Danny Kahneman's work, from his early studies on attention and effort, the development of Prospect Theory (initially intended to be called Regret Theory), to the heuristics and biases program, the discovery of the peak-end rule, his research on hedonic well-being, and ultimately to the concept of "System 1". Yet, Kahneman never explicitly labeled any of the effects he studied as the "affect heuristic"; instead, his longtime friend and collaborator, Paul Slovic, coined the term. I'd like to believe that this is because Kahneman treated affect as integral to many of the problems he explored throughout his career. As the quote above suggests, Kahneman regarded the affect heuristic as one of the all-purpose heuristics (along with representativeness and availability), and perhaps the best example of attribute substitution, where affect (the associated attribute) tends to be more accessible and salient than most target attributes. The substitution of the target attribute with affective feelings often goes undetected by System 2, thus exerting a significant influence on many of our everyday judgments and decisions. This substitution process can be heuristic and mostly helpful, but at times it biases behavior. Therefore, it might be fitting to consider the role of affect in judgments and decisions as 'affect, good and bad'. <ref type="bibr">Kahneman</ref> "Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it" <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman, 2011b, p. 1)</ref>.</p><p>This statement is about what Daniel Kahneman calls "the focusing illusion": the idea that some aspect of life is a major contributor to well-being, which often turns out to be an illusion, created because you are focusing on that aspect of life on the time. Consider, for example, the question whether you would be happier living in Miami or instead Chicago. If you focus on weather, you might think that you would be happier in Miami; it's much warmer there. But for most people, weather has little or no impact on happiness. Most of the time, people's happiness is a product of numerous other things: their relationships, their work, their wealth, their health. If you are thinking about weather, a car, or a restaurant, you will likely exaggerate its impact on your well-being.</p><p>Kahneman was keenly interested in attention, and his work on the focusing illusion was connected with that interest. Hedonic forecasting errors may well be a product of the focusing illusion. You might wrongly think that some change -a new job, a new city -will have a large effect on your state of mind, simply because you are focusing on that change.</p><p>Submitted by Cass Sunstein, Harvard Law School KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 11 "Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while thinking about it." <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman, 2011b, p.</ref> 1).</p><p>Danny often summarized the focusing illusion in the pithy format of a Chinese fortune cookie. It is an insight to heed in daily life: Many things seem extremely important and elicit intense feelings while we focus on them -and once attention moves elsewhere, importance, pain, and pleasure fade. Unfortunately, we rarely remember that insight when we need it most --in thrall of what we focus on.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Submitted by Norbert Schwarz, Mind &amp; Society Center, University of Southern California, Los</head><p>Angeles, USA</p><p>[1] "The moment-based approach raises a question that should not be dismissed too lightly. How much time will be spent in such consumption of memories relative to the duration of the original experience? The weight of memory relative to actual experience is likely to be reduced when time is taken seriously…." [2] "Because memories and stories of the past are all we ultimately get to keep, memory and stories often appear to be all that matters…." [3] "Although wholly devoid of permanence, the experiencing subject deserves a voice." <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman, 2000, p. *)</ref> Many know that Daniel Kahneman described himself as the grandfather of behavioral economics, but perhaps few know that he also regarded himself as the intellectual grandson of Kurt Lewin, the father of social psychology. At least, that was how he described himself in our final correspondence in 2022. Danny's self-description reflects keen self-insight for much of his KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 12 work indeed reveals a deep appreciation of Lewinian tension systems. His exploration of experienced utility provides a poignant example. As many know, Danny drew an important distinction between moment utility, the utility experienced in discrete time slices of the moving present, and remembered utility, the utility we reconstruct looking back on hedonic experiences.</p><p>But, as Quote 1 reveals, he went much further, encouraging us to grapple with the psychological tension between these irreconcilable perspectives and with how much weight each should receive. He eschewed oversimplification, acknowledging as Quote 2 suggests, that weight must also reflect qualitative considerations, such as the value of meaning imbued in episodic memory. Department of Psychology, York University, Canada "Because people are limited in their ability to comprehend and evaluate extreme probabilities, highly unlikely events are either ignored or overweighted, and the difference between high probability and certainty is either neglected or exaggerated. Consequently, π is not well-behaved near the end-points." <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kahneman, &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>. This is admittedly not the most inspiring or the most groundbreaking thing that Danny has ever written or said. Rather, it is simply a reiteration of an empirical fact and a brief explanation of how it is expressed in the context of Prospect Theory (subsequently restated for KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 13 Cumulative Prospect Theory). I chose to emphasize this quote, not because it is an important aspect of the theory (although it is), but because I think it illustrates an important point that we should all bear in mind when looking back at Danny's work.</p><p>Because, hand over heart, how many of us actually know that π is not well-behaved near the end-points? I certainly did not, until I read the original paper. This is a risk we inevitably run into when a theory becomes as successful and as widely cited as Cumulative Prospect Theory; the basic components of the theory, in this case the statement that small probabilities are overweighted, are cited and referenced so often that we are led to believe that is the extent of what the theory implies. As such, we might end up believing that we 'know' the theory without even reading the original work, meaning that references to the theory might become watered down, simplified, or simply incorrect. This is not just bad for research, it is also disrespectful to the original authors. Danny left behind a treasure trove of excellent research. We owe it to him to treat this inheritance with respect, by reading the original works and representing them properly.</p><p>Submitted by Joakim Sundh, Department of Psychology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden "The mathematical psychologists who participated in the survey not only should have known better-they did know better. Although their intuitive guesses were off the mark, most of them could have computed the correct answers on the back of an envelope."</p><p>In their 2002 paper that reconceptualized (most) judgment heuristics as the product of "attribute substitution," Kahneman and Frederick described the failure of members of the Mathematical Psychology Society to give sufficient weight to sample size when making KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 14 statistical estimates. Their words, in turn, capture a key finding from the heuristics and biases program of research: that many of our most common errors of judgment result, as the economist Matthew Rabin put it, "not because the right answers are so complex…[but] because the wrong answers are so enticing" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Rabin, 2013)</ref>. That perspective is important because it has proven to be unusually effective in disarming frequently-encountered objections to Kahneman and Tversky's research: "People aren't that stupid" or "Things are different in the real world where the stakes are higher than in the lab." Tellingly, even those who raise such objections will confess to having whatever rational analysis they might have conducted in response to some challenging problem beaten to the punch by a compelling intuitive assessment.

The brilliance of <ref type="bibr">Kahneman</ref>  it's that, if we are going to build a science of human behavior that provides a service to society, we need to recognize the way the system is built, how it is adaptive and how it is not. I take it as some justification for their project that the non-human systems that are most like humans-large-language models-are built from the same core principles as those identified by <ref type="bibr">Kahneman and Tversky.</ref> Submitted by Steven Sloman, Cognitive and Psychological Sciences, Brown University, Providence, USA "Irrational is a strong word, which connotes impulsivity, emotionality, and a stubborn resistance to reasonable argument. I often cringe when my work with Amos is credited with demonstrating that human choices are irrational, when in fact our research only showed that Humans are not well described by the rational-agent model."  When reflecting on Kahneman's legacy to the field, it is important to override what many take to be the intuitive implication of his work: That people are irredeemably irrational. As Kahneman consistently argued, the implication of his work is that humans are (simply) not rational. This is a subtle but important distinction. Being irrational is different from not being rational; someone who is irrational cannot be reasoned with and may have little hope of improving. Nowhere in Kahneman's work can you find a picture of humanity that is so bleak.</p><p>If the goal is not to demonstrate that people are irrational, then why focus so much on errors? There is a straightforward answer to this: We often learn the most from our errors. As George Miller famously argued in his 1969 address to the American Psychological Association, the most significant problems that humanity faces are ones that we've created for ourselves. In this context, Kahneman's work on the limitations of our cognition is absolutely critical if we are to improve our decision-making.</p><p>Kahneman understood that humans are imperfect but have the potential for improvement.</p><p>We make predictable mistakes, sure, but with some help we can make more accurate judgments and better decisions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 18</head><p>In conclusion, Kahneman's quote serves as a poignant reminder that the pitfalls of heuristic thinking and cognitive biases are not exclusive to laypeople; even experts in behavioral economics are susceptible. However, by acknowledging these limitations and striving for transparency and honesty in research, scholars can uphold the integrity of the field and continue to advance our understanding of human decision-making. "Psychological theories of intuitive thinking cannot match the elegance and precision of formal normative models of belief and choice, but this is just another way of saying that rational models are psychologically unrealistic" <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman, , p.1449</ref> In his keynote address at the 2017 APA convention, Daniel Kahneman expressed the opinion that, although behavioral economics is, in fact, applied social psychology, its prominence in shaping public policy stems from the fact that economics is portrayed as a mathematics-based, 'hard' science. The fruitful connection between psychology and economics was strengthened through the collaborative work of Tversky and Kahneman, which, though psychological in nature, drew upon the formal normative model of economics because it required a standard against which judgment and decision-making could be evaluated.</p><p>Initially, statistics provided such a standard, exemplified by concepts such as the law of large numbers, which were used to discern correct and incorrect responses to their constructed scenarios. As their research progressed, the criteria for sound reasoning expanded beyond statistics to encompass the rational agent model, the basis of economics. By systematically identifying behavioral deviations from the rational agent model, their psychological work exposed weaknesses in traditional economic theories.</p><p>Psychology defies confinement within a rigid set of rules and theorems, continually challenging our understanding of human nature. In contrast, the economics view of human nature can be neatly encapsulated in an hour-long presentation. As Kahneman's quote suggests, the dynamic between the two fields presents a dichotomous conundrum: psychology cannot elegantly explain human behavior in a restricted number of statements, while economics will struggle to offer a realistic interpretation of human behavior. Nevertheless, the ongoing dialogue between these disciplines propels the overarching field of behavioral science forward. Daniel Kahneman's contributions have been pivotal in initiating and advancing this discourse.</p><p>Submitted by Alexios Arvanitis, Department of Psychology, University of Crete, Rethymno,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Greece</head><p>"An algorithm that is constructed on the back of an envelope is often good enough to compete with an optimally weighted formula, and certainly good enough to outdo expert judgment."  Daniel Kahneman opened our eyes to the limitations of human judgment and prediction.</p><p>He taught us that the world is less certain than we think, that the future does not resemble the past, and that people, even experts, are far worse at forecasting than they expect. One of the KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 20 major takeaways was the need for objective, bias-free forecasting instruments. Indeed, newly-developed algorithms avoid many traps that fail humans. Algorithms favor the informative and diagnostic over the vivid and available, weight uncertainty properly and are impervious to emotional and social influences. Consequently, they can answer medical, financial, and geopolitical questions more accurately than humans and form the basis for better decision making. Problem solved? Not quite. The flaws of human judgment get in the way again.</p><p>Although algorithms generally achieve vastly superior performance, people keep rejecting them.</p><p>In trying to understand the impediments to the acceptance of algorithms, Kahneman has the answers yet again. His findings on overconfidence, confirmation bias and regret aversion explain the tendency of people to favor their own faulty judgments over those of more accurate systematic tools. Kahneman's insights have brought together psychologists, computer scientists, and scholars from related fields, collaborating to integrate behavioral insights in the design of algorithmic decision aids to which people would be receptive. Multidisciplinary research on the cognitive and behavioral aspects of algorithm acceptance is still in its infant stages, with so much yet to explore. Thus, Daniel Kahneman's work has not only influenced decades of research so far, but will continue to shape the study of decision making for decades to come. In the digital age, people increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) that are primarily trained and fine-tuned to tell coherent stories. However, "declarations of high confidence mainly tell you that an individual has constructed a coherent story in his mind, not necessarily that the story is true." <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman, 2011, p. 212</ref>) By promoting the "illusion of validity," the coherence of AI-generated text is often criticized for communicating falsities with high confidence. Similar to overconfident human advisors, System 2, or slow thinking, could thus be a countermeasure against hallucinatory generative AI. In education, LLMs in tutoring systems are enabled to 'think' in the backend. Output that is not observable to student users in the frontend is necessary because relevant context, such as the solution path for a task, must be generated before students can be given valuable hints on how to approach the problem themselves. Instead of "jump[ing] to conclusions from little evidence" <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman, 2011, p.</ref> 209), or context in LLM terminology, thinking in the backend can be seen as slowly thinking through the problem. On the one hand, this is due to the fact that the corresponding text generation requires more time and computational resources. On the other hand, and much more importantly, the inherent enforcement of multi-shot prompting triggers more deliberate and logical thinking, which is reflected in the improved quality of such LLM-generated output.</p><p>Students benefit from being trained to solve the task on their own, rather than being provided with the correct solution immediately. The intention is to help them to improve their own slow-thinking skills through fruitful and affordable one-on-one tutoring in LLM-augmented digital learning environments. System 2 will not only facilitate this transition in individualized education, but also has the potential to be a game changer in everyday life, which is increasingly threatened by overconfidence in hallucinatory generative AI.</p><p>Submitted by Tobias R Rebholz, Psychology Department, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany "A failure to disagree" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kahneman &amp; Klein, 2009)</ref> Truth, not consensus, is science's ultimate goal. Although a state of consensus signals to the world that we, as a scientific community, have reached (for the time being) some semblance of the truth, reaching the truth requires disagreement, not harmony. The path to the truth requires academic debate, not academic unity. Our goal should never be a room of similarly minded others nodding their heads or a first-round acceptance by a prestigious journal. Our goal has always been, and always should be, disagreement. No psychologist in recent memory has embodied this goal better than Daniel Kahneman. Daniel Kahneman has, without a doubt, taught us a lot about the inner workings of the human mind. Yet, he has given us much more than that.</p><p>Kahneman has given us a roadmap, a goal, and an understanding of what we, as scientists, should be striving for.

In trying to understand human judgment, Kahneman tried, and failed, to disagree. Luckily, we are still reaping the fruits of his failure.</p><p>Only when we find the truth and finally understand the ins and outs of the human experience, should we stop trying to disagree. Reaching scientific consensus may be satisfying, but it should never be our objective. Only when we fail to disagree will we know that we have reached the truth.

This position still seems reasonable to me -it is why I think people should believe in climate change. But the argument only holds when all relevant results are published. ...

[…] I would be proud to be called an applied behavioral scientist." <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman, 2013, p.</ref>  One of Daniel Kahneman's enduring legacies will be his advocacy for scientific approaches that hinge on the intrinsic motivation to seek truth, such as adversarial collaborations and scaling up for multi-lab collaborations when the standard small-teams approach to science has potentially failed. Knowledge accumulation is inherently a collective enterprise, but depends on the individual labors of scientists, whose professional payoffs can be misaligned with the collective good. The prevailing incentive system discourages the abandonment of signature theories and creates barriers against mass collaborations. But fortunately, academia selects for the intrinsic motivation Prof. Kahneman embodied as well. Large-scale initiatives have flourished in recent years, despite the limited professional benefits of either leading or joining the crowd. In the inspirational quote from Prof. Kahneman above, he advocated for a daisy chain of expert laboratories to attempt to replicate prime-to-behavior effects. The failure to answer his call for more than a decade now has sent an unmistakable signal: that priming researchers have no faith in our own findings. Our ongoing adversarial collaboration including both proponents and critics of priming has organized a replication ring of more than 100 laboratories to re-examine nine published studies volunteered by the original authors. The consortium includes both an "inner ring" of expert teams and an "outer ring" consisting of any colleague willing to help. This will put to a rigorous empirical test not only the robustness and context sensitivity of prime-to-behavior effects under the most favorable circumstances possible, but also Prof. is not easily distinguished from truth." <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman, 2011, chapter 5, p. 48)</ref>.</p><p>In an era of information overload, where screens are flooded with news and opinions, the elusive nature of truth becomes increasingly apparent. At the heart of this phenomenon lies the intricate interplay among information repetition, familiarity, and the perception of truth. Daniel Kahneman's quote, "A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth," encapsulates a profound insight into human cognition and the mechanisms underlying belief formation. This statement emphasizes peoples' susceptibility to persuasion through the manipulation of information repetition, shedding light on the cognitive biases that influence decision-making processes. At its essence, this quote underscores the illusory truth effect, wherein repeated exposure to a statement or idea enhances its perceived validity, irrespective of its actual veracity. Of course it takes more than just writing a book to impact science the way Kahneman has, and in this regard it is worth noting another quote which concerns especially his assessment of his and Tversky's personalities when creating the work and understanding that would lead to their success.</p></div>

The simulation can be constrained and controlled in several ways… We construe the output of simulation as an assessment of the ease with which the model could produce different outcomes, given its initial conditions and operating parameters." <ref type="bibr">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1982, p. 201)</ref>.</p><p>In their 7-page paper on the simulation heuristic, Kahneman and Tversky present preliminary research on the rules of mental simulation and its importance in performing several types of judgment tasks (e.g., prediction, assessing probability and causality) as well as experiencing different affective states (e.g., regret). In doing so, they connect cognition with emotion, and consider the effect of this interplay on people's hedonic adaptation.</p><p>Despite garnering considerably fewer citations than their other work (i.e.,&lt;;3,000 according to GoogleScholar), the simulation heuristic went on to inspire a whole area of psychological inquiry, namely that on 'counterfactual thinking.' This has resulted in understanding of, for example, norms in social cognition, causal judgment, coping mechanisms, as well as solutions to problems in domains such as health and justice. I found that prompting offenders to think about what 'coulda, woulda, or shoulda' happened when committing crime, being caught and convicted increased their willingness to accept culpability -useful for sentencing and alternative dispute resolution.</p></div>

In a characteristically humble manner, Kahneman recalls how his collaborators planted the seeds for the creation of 'nudge' units embedded in the US and UK governments.What commenced with a focus on nudging in central government quickly turned into a global movement. Specialised consultancies and agencies have sprung up, and behavioural insight units are now embedded in governments, industries, and third sector organisations around the world.As the movement gained traction, practitioners moved beyond nudging and embraced the full spectrum of behaviour change approaches.Kahneman describes the movement as one of the major achievements of applied social and cognitive psychology. It is one of Kahneman's enduring legacies. The movement has touched the lives of thousands if not millions of people benefiting from improved policies and services around the world. It has also profoundly changed the lives of many psychology graduates who are, and will be, working in this area. For many, nudging is synonymous with behavioural economics. Kahneman recognised the opportunities and challenges arising from applied social and cognitive psychology becoming popular under the mantle of economics. In the foreword, he expressed concerns that young psychologists may be put off and may not recognise the achievements of their own discipline. Kahneman suggested 'behavioural scientist' as a unifying label for those working in this space. It is incumbent upon us to honour Kahneman's legacy by educating psychology students about the behavioural insights movement, giving them the skills they need, and instilling a sense of pride and confidence to lead the way as the next generation of behavioural scientists.Submitted by Mario Weick, Department of Psychology, Durham University, Durham, point of my letter is that you should do something, and that you must do it collectively."<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kahneman, D.

Culturally, the prevalence of information repetition has fueled binge-watching culture and the consumption of repetitive narratives, shaping perceptions of success and identity. For the scientific community, Kahneman's quote serves as a reminder of the imperative of empirical evidence and critical thinking in assessing assertions. It underscores the necessity of rigorous research methodologies and skepticism in the face of persuasive rhetoric. In essence, Kahneman's quote sheds light on the intricate interplay between cognition, persuasion, and belief formation, offering invaluable insights that underscore the enduring relevance of his contributions to understanding human behavior. Submitted by: Pandey, Shubham, University of Osnabrück, Germany "This book presents my current understanding of judgment and decision making, which has been shaped by psychological discoveries of recent decades." (Page i, Kahneman, 2011). This description by Kahneman of Thinking Fast and Slow is important to highlightbecause it is what the field needs more of, summaries of expert knowledge on large and general topics, for the public. There are many good reasons to encourage writing on such large topics with informed opinion. It is also easy to see the value Kahneman unlocked with the action.</figDesc></figure>

This quote highlights two opposing dynamics: theunwarranted confidence in flawed beliefs and the essential need for confidence in evidence-based knowledge, despite inherent uncertainties. On one hand, Kahneman's notion of preposterousness applies to the resistance against evidence due to unwarranted confidence in flawed beliefs. Despite the abundance of evidence on anthropogenic climate change and its associated risks, some individuals cling to flawed beliefs, KAHNEMAN IN QUOTES AND REFLECTIONS 30 dismissing or ignoring contradictory evidence. This unwarranted confidence obstructs meaningful political action to address climate change and its consequences. Conversely, the quote's assertion of essentiality resonates with the necessity of confidence in the robustness of climate change evidence and the effectiveness of scientific, political, and technological solutions. Without confidence in scientific and technological knowledge, individuals and societies may hesitate to adopt necessary changes or advocate for impactful policies, impeding progress toward addressing climate change. This essential confidence is further exemplified by skeptical campaigns that often exploit uncertainties in climate science to sow doubt and undermine confidence in climate science and the effectiveness of climate policy. Kahneman's quote serves as a reminder of the delicate balance required in navigating confidence in climate change beliefs. While acknowledging the folly of unwarranted confidence in flawed beliefs, it highlights the importance of sufficient confidence in scientific evidence and our ability to act. Striking this balance is crucial in effectively addressing the challenges of climate change.</figDesc></figure>

In today's tumultuous world, Kahneman's theories gain acute relevance. The conflict in Israel, for instance, exemplifies the complexities of human decision-making under uncertainty, where Kahneman's findings offer deep insights into both the actions of leaders and the reactions of the populace. The rampant spread of fake news underscores the pertinence of Kahneman's work on how easily we construct coherent narratives from the past, often ignoring the unpredictable nature of unfolding events. The cognitive ease with which humans retrospectively explain complex phenomena illuminates the challenges we face in discerning truth from falsehood in a post-truth era. Kahneman's contributions extend beyond academia. Through teachings and research, Kahneman advanced our understanding of the human mind and equipped us with the intellectual tools to better understand and shape our world, reflecting a monumental and transformative legacy.</figDesc></figure>

'Entrepreneurial actors' claim that decisions they make are correct, based on available data. Now, these applications have been scanned under cellular and chromosomal prism. Prof Daniel attempted to create 'corrective' decisions by exploring issues like disruption of decision making processes in brain pathways, brain's perception of data sources, and internal processes that execute with strong values. Endeavor was to monitor perception of neuro-economic drivers of behavioral patterns using tools from Economics, Psychology, Neuroscience, Mathematics and Statistics to understand underlying behavior and decision making. Notes of Daniel inspire new questions, powerful theoretical and practical implications, challenging approaches and outcomes, and bold implications. Considering management of decision, in terms of 'homo-psycho-economics', chaos and rationalization, to infinity of 'next' and 'transition' of 'brain' formulas' presents theoretical and empirical methods to understand neuro-economic drivers underlying 'stimulus' through interdisciplinary tools. Focus is to replicate chaos and biology of control data to explore nature of causal relationships, identify ways to test causal relationships, use cognitive and neural approaches, and describe neural pathways of decisions.

To do the right thing, people need help. They need the help of normative theories, of other people, and of social institutions. When I look at what's going on in the world, it could not be more obvious than that individuals-and some communities-have beliefs and behaviors that are (to put it mildly) counter-normative.
