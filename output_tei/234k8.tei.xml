<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Braking behaviour of automated vehicles as critical implicit communication for pedestrians' vehicle behaviour estimation and road crossing</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Automated vehicles (AVs), equipped with sensors, cameras and radars, use intelligent detection and motion planning algorithms to mitigate human operational errors and have become one of the most promising solutions to many current traffic issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(El Hamdani et al., 2020)</ref>. However, AVs may bring about dramatic changes in the traditional communication mode between vehicles and other vulnerable road users (VRUs) due to the absence of a driver or a driver not focused on driving. For instance, the communication methods, like eye contact or hand gestures, may no longer exist, and pedestrians may have to rely purely on vehicles' movements to judge the situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(de Clercq et al., 2019)</ref>. Recent studies have shown that failures in communication between AVs and VRUs (e.g., pedestrians) could lead to traffic dilemmas and additional safety issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(El Hamdani et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Millard-Ball, 2018</ref>). Consequently, this concern has engendered a wide range of research in multiple fields, such as road user behaviour research <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lee et al., 2022)</ref>, computational modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Pekkanen et al., 2022)</ref>, external human-machine interface research (eHMI) (de Clercq et al., 2019) and more.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1.">Explicit and implicit communication signals</head><p>In the communication between pedestrians and vehicles, the communication signals from approaching vehicles used by pedestrians can be divided into two categories, i.e., explicit and implicit signals. Explicit signals usually refer to a road user behaviour which signals information to other road users without affecting the communicator's own movement or perception, 2 while implicit signals are road user behaviour which affects own movement but can also be interpreted as cues about one's intention or movement by another road user <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Markkula et al., 2020)</ref>. In conventional traffic scenarios, the most observed explicit signals are eye contact, hand gestures, and light signal. There is convincing evidence to support the role of eye contact in pedestrian-vehicle interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Markkula et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nathanael et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rasouli and Tsotsos, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">AlAdawy et al., 2019)</ref>. Pedestrians seek eye contact to ensure that they have been seen by drivers or request the right of way and may increase the perceived safety of pedestrians <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Onkhar et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Compared to eye contact, the hand gesture and light signal are relatively less likely to be observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Lee et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Nathanael et al., 2018)</ref>. For future traffic scenarios that include AVs, the conventional explicit signals may be compromised; eHMIs, therefore, act as a remedy to make up for missing communications and help reduce uncertainty in pedestrian behaviour. Road traffic can be seen as a social system in which continuous reciprocal communication between road users is necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackermann et al., 2019)</ref>. The smooth integration of AVs in society requires them to clearly signal their intentions and movements to all other road users, and eHMIs thus may have critical significance in improving social acceptance of AVs <ref type="bibr">(Carmona et al., 2021</ref>).</p><p>However, there are some different opinions about explicit communication and eHMIs. Firstly, the reliability of eHMIs has been questioned as it may be affected by the weather <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kooijman et al., 2019)</ref>, light condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rasouli and Tsotsos, 2019)</ref>, as well as traffic situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dey et al., 2021)</ref>. Moreover, some studies have shown that pedestrians rarely use explicit signals in their daily life compared to implicit signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dey and Terken, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lee et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The existence of explicit signals may not significantly affect the quality of pedestrian crossing behaviour. Reasonable implicit signals are enough for pedestrians to interact with AVs safely <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Moore et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Palmeiro et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Sripada et al., 2021)</ref>. Furthermore, several recent studies have shown that the effect of eHMIs on pedestrians is itself influenced by implicit signals, such as vehicle deceleration and distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(de Clercq et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dey et al., 2021</ref>).</p><p>Intuitively, implicit signals are more reliable than explicit signals since they are directly related to the intention or movement of the vehicle. In road-crossing scenarios, pedestrian road-crossing behaviour was affected by different implicit signals contingent on traffic scenarios. At uncontrolled intersections, where drivers are not required to give way to pedestrians, Drivers may speed up as a signal to request the right of way and go first <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rasouli et al., 2018)</ref>. Meanwhile, as distance and time to collision (TTC) positively correlate with pedestrian crossing acceptance, drivers/AVs could affect pedestrian crossing behaviour by adjusting these kinematics <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tian et al., 2022a)</ref>.</p><p>In naturalistic observation, most pedestrians crossed the road when the approaching vehicle fully stopped or slowed down <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sucha et al., 2017)</ref>. There is evidence that the speed adaption behaviour of drivers, e.g., deceleration, is a critical implicit signal affecting pedestrian behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ackermann et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">de Clercq et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lee et al., 2022)</ref>. Early-onset braking behaviour and strong pitching reduce the time required for pedestrians to understand the behaviour of the approaching vehicle <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dietrich et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackermann et al., 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zimmermann and Wettach (2017)</ref> indicated that vehicle braking behaviour is correlated to pedestrian emotion and influenced pedestrian decisions. When approaching vehicles slowed down early and braked lightly, pedestrians felt comfortable and initiated crossing quickly. However, the late and harsh braking led to pedestrian avoidance behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dey et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Risto et al., 2017)</ref>. In addition, when the driver shortens the lateral distance to pedestrians while yielding to pedestrians, it can help pedestrians understand the vehicle's yielding behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Sripada et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.">Visual cues in road crossing scenarios</head><p>Up to this point, all findings mentioned above support the role of implicit signals. However, from a more general and psychological perspective, it has been shown that humans do not base their crossing decisions on direct estimation of absolute speed, TTC, distance or deceleration rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Lee et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Petzoldt, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sun et al., 2015)</ref>; instead, the movement of the vehicle is estimated from visual cues, such as visual angle, its change rate, and more <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(DeLucia, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lee, 1976)</ref>. These visual cues have been proposed based on optical flow field theory and are thought to provide a more realistic description of pedestrian perceived collision risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(DeLucia, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lee, 1976)</ref>.</p><p>Visual angle represents the image size of objects on the observer's retina.</p><p>Its change rate describes the image's expansion rate, which usually links to human perception of approaching objects. It has been found that pedestrian crossing behaviour is strongly correlated to the change rate of visual angle in scenarios where vehicles do not yield to pedestrians <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tian et al., 2022a</ref>).</p><p>Moreover, τ , i.e., the ratio of visual angle to the change rate of visual angle, specifies the TTC to approaching vehicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lee, 1976)</ref>. If the change rate of τ is greater than -0.5, it means the deceleration rate of the approaching object is enough to stop in front of the observer, and then the collision events can be avoided <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lee, 1976)</ref>. A detailed demonstration of visual cues in crossing scenarios is in Appendix A. According to the above discussion, it would be valuable to investigate the correlation between visual cues and pedestrian crossing decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.">Research gaps and questions</head><p>Understanding how pedestrians communicate with vehicles has positive implications for traffic safety and the development of AVs. The above literature provides strong evidence to support the important role of implicit signals in pedestrian-AV interactions. Those studies often assume that pedestrians observe the vehicle's behaviour and use this to infer the intentions of the approaching driver/AV. However, direct research on any such pedestrian behaviour estimation process is very limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Predhumeau et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rasouli and Tsotsos, 2019)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sun et al. (2015)</ref>  and how this judgment changes over time. Furthermore, it has arguably not been clearly demonstrated that pedestrians incorporate subjective estimations of driver/AV intentions as part of their crossing decisions. In principle, pedestrians could directly rely on the momentary perceived collision risk as indicated by the visual cues, e.g., when a vehicle decelerates, the actual TTC increases, which could be the cause of the direct trigger for the pedestrian crossing without any separate inference of vehicle intentions. Pekkanen et al.</p><p>(2022) provides some model-based evidence in support of a separate process of behaviour estimation by pedestrians but does not collect any subjective estimation data. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has collected both subjective estimation data and objective crossing data from pedestrians in the same scenarios to permit a comparison between the two. Given the above-identified research gaps, two research questions were proposed in this study:</p><p>• Deceleration: The car decelerated with a constant deceleration rate from the start of the scenario until it stopped 2.5 m from the participant, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Mixed : The previous study indicated that late-onset braking manoeuvre could make pedestrians unpleasant and result in reduced crossing willingness <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dey et al., 2021)</ref>. However, less is known about how those braking behaviours affect actual crossing decisions and pedestrian estimation. In this study, we thus introduced a condition with both constant speed and deceleration behaviour, called a mixed condition, as a comparison to a pure deceleration condition. In this scenario, the vehicle maintained constant speed for a certain period and slowed down until it stopped at 2.5 m from the participant. Hence, the mixed condition was considered as late-onset braking behaviour compared to the deceleration condition. To make sure the deceleration rate for each condition is greater than the deceleration rate of the corresponding condition of the deceleration condition, we determined a constant speed travel time of 1.5 s for 3 s initial TTC condition and 3.4 s for 6 s initial TTC condition, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Constant speed : Finally, the constant speed scenario was applied as a baseline, where the vehicle maintained constant speed for the entire scenario duration, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>   In this study, participants were required to complete two different tasks, including a natural road crossing task and a vehicle behaviour estimation task.</p><p>Task one was a road-crossing task. Participants were informed: " If you decide to cross, please walk naturally as you would do in everyday life and stop before that wall. If you decide not to cross, just wait for the vehicle to pass".</p><p>In the first task, participants initially stood at a marked starting point, 57</p><p>cm from the edge of the pavement. The road environment on the participants' right hand was obscured by a white rectangle to prevent participants from getting traffic information before the trial started ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1A)</ref>. A message was presented on the screen in front of the participants, saying: "Please Look Here. Keep Looking" <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1A)</ref>. The message would disappear after participants had looked at it for 1 second. Participants had been instructed that once the message disappeared, they should look toward the right once they were ready to start the next trial. When the participant turned their head, the traffic scenario started from its initial state, and the white rectangle was removed ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1B1</ref>). During the scenario, participants would decide whether to cross the road or not <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1C1</ref>). If participants crossed to the opposite pavement, the trial ended when they reached the opposite side of the road.</p><p>If participants rejected the crossing opportunity, the trial ended when the vehicle passed them. Task one consisted of a practice session and an experiment session. The practice session provided participants with 10 trials to familiarise themselves with the task. In the experiment session, 18 experimental Scenarios were presented randomly and repeated once. Accordingly, we collected 18 (Scenarios) × 30 (Participats) × 2(Repetitions) = 1080 trials of data. After the first task, participants had a 10-minute break before the second experimental task.</p><p>Task two was a vehicle behaviour estimation task. Participants were required to estimate if the vehicle was giving way to them or keeping a constant speed and passing by them after watching a segment of the traffic scenario ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1B2</ref>). We collected their subjective estimations about vehicle behaviour using a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of two questions.</p><p>The first one was "Was the vehicle stopping for you, or was it maintaining its speed and passing you? ". Participants could answer either "stopping" or "passing". The second one was "How confident are you in your previous answer? ". Participants could select their confidence level from a scale of 1 to 9, where 1 and 9 meant not confident at all and totally confident, respectively.</p><p>In this paper, we only analyse the data from the first question.</p><p>In the second task, the participants did not need to move but rather observed segments of the traffic scenarios and answered questions. At the beginning of each trial, participants stood at the marked starting point as in the first task. The scenario was triggered in the same way as in the first task. Afterwards, a segment of a traffic scenario was presented ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1B2</ref>).</p><p>At the end of the segment, the entire environment was obscured, and the questionnaire appeared on the screen for the participants to answer ( </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">D i = a 5−i ; a = 5 D int , i = 1, . . . , 3; D 4 = 2.5<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where D i refers to the distance between the approaching vehicle and the pedestrian at the ith measuring point <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2)</ref>. a is a logarithmic base based on the initial distance of the approaching vehicle, D int . D 4 is always equal to 2.5 m, i.e., the final stopping distance from pedestrians <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2)</ref>. The constant speed scenarios were also clipped to get four segments as comparisons with two yielding scenarios. The four measuring distances from participants were given as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D i = D int − ai; a = (D int − D a ) /4, i = 1, . . . , 3; D 4 = 2.5<label>(2)</label></formula><p>In pilot testing, the method described above was found to work well, except for the 1st segment of the constant speed scenario with 3 s initial TTC. This segment was too short to permit meaningful observation, so its duration was increased to 1 s. The final parameters are shown in <ref type="table">Table   B</ref>.2, showing that the resultingτ ranges at the end of the first three segments were [-1, -0.36], <ref type="bibr">[-0.36, -0.16]</ref>, and <ref type="bibr">[-0.16, 0.99]</ref>, and largeτ after the fourth segment, thus achieving almost complete separation ofτ between divisions. The traffic scenarios of the 18 experimental conditions were thus divided into 72 segments for the participants to experience. We collected 72 (Segments) × 30 (Participats) = 2160 trials of data for the second task.</p><p>The task also consisted of a practice session and an experiment session. The practice session provided participants with ten trials. In the experiment session, the 72 segments were presented randomly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Data processing and reduction</head><p>The following criteria were applied to recognise participants' decisions to cross the road: (a) The longitudinal position of the participant should exceed the edge of the pavement; (b) The change in longitudinal position in one simulation time step, i.e., 120 Hz, should be bigger than 0.003 m; (c) 2 s after the first two conditions were met, the participant must be further than 1.1 m from the edge of the pavement <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Tian et al., 2022b)</ref>. To analyse participants' crossing behaviour, their crossing initiation time (CIT) is normally used in the literature, which generally refers to the time taken for participants to start crossing the road after the approaching vehicle appears in the participants' view or the rear end of the previous vehicle just passing participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lee et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lobjois and Cavallo, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pekkanen et al., 2022)</ref>. However, the CIT is not applicable for this study because the time duration from the traffic scenario starts to the vehicle stop in the experimental conditions with the same TTC is different (Please see the duration of the 4th segments in <ref type="table">Table B</ref>.2), which led to the fact that the CIT of pedestrians making decisions based on vehicle yielding behaviour is not on the same time scale.</p><p>For example, the duration of the deceleration condition with 6 s TTC and 55 km/h initial speed is 11.67 s, bigger than the duration of the deceleration condition with 6 s TTC and 25 km/h initial speed, i.e.,11.28 s. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lee et al. (2022)</ref>, researchers applied CIT in similar traffic scenarios. However, they analysed the difference in aggregate CIT between normal AV and AV equipped with eHMI conditions, which is not the case in our study. Instead, we applied Z c , i.e., the distance between the participant and the vehicle when the pedestrian started crossing. For the second task, those answers were binary data, i.e., one indicated the judgment that the vehicle was stopping for the participant, and zero indicated that the vehicle was maintaining its speed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Task one: Road crossing decisions across a range of traffic scenarios</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Fig</ref> With the increase in the initial speed and TTC, pedestrians crossed the road further away from the car <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lee et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, as shown in subfigures in the third and fourth rows of <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, in the scenarios including vehicle deceleration and the larger initial TTC, pedestrian crossing decisions had a bimodal distribution. Some pedestrians chose to cross shortly after the traffic scenario was triggered, while the others crossed after the vehicle had stopped or before it was about to stop, consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Giles et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lee et al., 2022</ref>). Therefore, we categorised the crossing decisions in deceleration and mixed conditions into early and late crossings. The separation thresholds were the end distances of the first segments of the traffic scenarios in the second task <ref type="table">(Table   B</ref>.2), indicated with vertical grey lines in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>, because there were subtle or no deceleration cues in scenarios before these thresholds, so pedestrians were less likely to make crossing decisions based on vehicle deceleration behaviour. If pedestrians crossed the road before the time threshold, these decisions were identified as early crossings, while others were identified as late crossings <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>. It can be found the patterns of early crossings were Figure 3: Density functions of Z c in the first task. The rows have identical initial TTC and the columns have identical initial speed. Corresponding vehicle trajectory is denoted using a black solid curve. As there were no pedestrians crossing the road in 3 s TTC and constant speed conditions, no data are available for these conditions. The data in deceleration and mixed conditions are separated into early and late crossings using thresholds (solid grey lines). The corresponding number of early crossings in each condition is plotted in the subfigure. similar for the three different driving behaviours. For example, under deceleration and mixed conditions with 3 s initial TTC, nearly no pedestrian crossed the road in the early phases of the scenarios. The same was true for the constant speed conditions with 3 s initial TTC. Moreover, for mixed conditions with 6 s initial TTC, the number of crossing decisions in the early phase was 31, 33, and 44 at 25, 40, and 55 km/h. The corresponding numbers in the deceleration and constant speed conditions were 31, 43, 44 and 32, 36, 37, respectively <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3)</ref>. A logistic regression was applied to pedestrians' early crossing decisions with initial speed, TTC, and driving behaviour as independent variables. There is no significant difference in the early crossing decision between vehicle behaviour conditions. In addition, it was found that pedestrians appeared to adjust their decisions to the initial speed, and fewer pedestrians crossed the road early as the initial speed decreased (Coef. = −0.02, Std.Error = 0.073, p &lt; 0.01). In line with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(DeLucia, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Giles et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pekkanen et al., 2022)</ref>, it is hypothesised that pedestrians may adopt different strategies to determine their crossing decisions when a decelerating vehicle is approaching, which is formally concretised as follows:</p><p>• In the early phase of a traffic scenario, pedestrians make crossing decisions mainly based on a traffic gap (e.g., distance or TTC of the approaching vehicle) and are not concerned with vehicle yielding behaviour. This strategy is also valid in constant speed scenarios.</p><p>• If pedestrians fail to cross at the early phase of a traffic scenario, pedestrians may tend to mainly focus on the speed and details of the behaviour of the approaching vehicle.</p><p>To further investigate the above strategies, the same mixed-effects linear regression analysis above was applied to each of the separated data, i.e., early and late crossings.</p><p>The early crossings in yielding scenarios were compared to those in constantspeed scenarios. The results found no difference in pedestrian crossing decisions for constant speed, deceleration, and mixed conditions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig. 4)</ref>, which indicated that the early crossing decisions in vehicle-yielding scenarios had a similar pattern with the decisions in constant speed scenarios, supporting our assumption. Moreover, initial speed similarly positively impacted pedestrian crossing decisions across all types of traffic scenarios (Coef. = 1.22, z = 68.75, p &lt; 0.001). to wait for the vehicle to come to a complete stop. However, more pedestrians crossed the road before the vehicle stopped in deceleration conditions compared to mixed conditions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">(Fig. 5)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Task two: Vehicle behaviour estimation</head><p>In the second task, we investigated the pedestrian judgments of approaching vehicle behaviour in detail. A mixed-effects logit regression model was applied to the pedestrian 'stopping' judgment with initial speed, initial TTC, and driving behaviour as independent variables. Participants' individual differences were considered as a random intercept in the model. Significant main effects of initial speed, initial TTC, and driving behaviour were found.</p><p>Specifically, the initial TTC had a positive effect on the 'stopping' judgment (Coef. = 0.94, z = 7.84, p &lt; 0.001), showing that pedestrians tended to believe that the vehicle was yielding to them at long initial TTC conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6)</ref>. However, the initial speed negatively affected the 'stopping' judgment (Coef. = −0.06, z = −11.80, p &lt; 0.001), indicating that the lower the initial speed, the higher the proportion of 'stopping' judgments ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 6</ref>). Moreover, pedestrians' judgments in different driving scenarios were also different. As expected, pedestrians in deceleration and mixed conditions were more likely to make a 'stopping' judgment as the vehicle yielded to them <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 6</ref>). Furthermore, there was a significant difference between pedestrians' judgments in deceleration and mixed conditions, indicating that pedestrians better judged yielding vehicle behaviour in deceleration conditions (Coef. = 3.39, z = 8.38, p &lt; 0.001). Due to the apparent differences in the judgment of different scenarios, we separately analysed data in respective scenarios with initial speed, initial TTC, and segment as independent variables, as described below.</p><p>For the constant speed scenario, pedestrians tended to make more 'stopping' judgments at bigger initial TTC and lower initial speed conditions (Coef. = 2.99, z = 9.90, p &lt; 0.001; Coef. = −0.10, z = −9.02, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>From the first segment to the fourth segment, 'stopping judgments' decreased (Coef. = −1.18, z = −10.00, p &lt; 0.001), showing that over time pedestrians were able to discern that the vehicle was keeping a constant speed <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig.   6c</ref>). Regarding deceleration conditions, the effects of initial TTC and initial speed had the same tendency with the results in constant speed scenarios (Coef. = 1.40, z = 4.33, p &lt; 0.001; Coef. = −0.05, z = −3.38, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Furthermore,τ was added to the regression model as an independent variable <ref type="table">(Table B</ref>.2). Largerτ were associated with an increased tendency to judge that the vehicle was stopping (Coef. = 4.70, z = 4.33, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting that with the increase in visual cues, the yielding behaviour of the approaching vehicle was more obvious to pedestrians <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 6)</ref>.</p><p>Notably, the situation becomes somewhat more complicated in mixed conditions, as shown in 'stopping' judgments in the mixed condition increased more than that in the deceleration condition asτ increased <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Fig. 6)</ref>. Although pedestrians' could better judge the yielding behaviour with the increase inτ in both scenarios (Coef. = 0.27, z = 6.70, p &lt; 0.001), the increasing level was different between the mixed and deceleration conditions, showing that a similar level ofτ , pedestrians could better anticipate the yielding behaviour in the deceleration condition than in the mixed condition (Coef. = 0.13, z = 1.98, p = 0.047).</p><p>Additionally, a significant interaction effect was found between the initial TTC and segment (Coef. = −0.21, z = −9.29, p &lt; 0.001). For instance, in the scenario with the 3 s initial TTC and 25 mph initial speed, the proportion of 'stopping' judgements increased from about 60% to 100 % as the segment changed from the first one to the fourth one. However, for the 6 s initial TTC and 25 mph initial speed condition, the rate of 'stopping' judgments was high at the beginning (i.e., about 94%) and remained at this high level.</p><p>It indicated that pedestrians' initial 'stopping' judgments in the 3 s initial TTC condition were lower than the values in the 6 s initial TTC condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>This study designed two tasks to investigate pedestrian crossing behaviour and estimations of vehicle behaviour when interacting with an AV. The primary aim was to identify the impacts of implicit signals on pedestrian crossing behaviour and their subjective estimation of approaching vehicle behaviour across a wide range of traffic scenarios. In the first task, we studied the influence of initial vehicle speed, initial TTC, and driving behaviour on pedestrian road crossing decisions. In the second task, we investigated the pedestrian estimation of approaching vehicle behaviour in the same scenarios, and a cross-comparison of the two tasks was performed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Impacts of implicit signals on road crossing behaviour</head><p>The effects of initial vehicle speed and initial TTC had the same tendency across all scenarios, indicating that pedestrians crossed the road farther from the vehicle as speed and TTC increased. Consistent with previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Giles et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lee et al., 2022)</ref>, in yielding and non-yielding scenarios, pedestrians preferred to cross the road in larger spatial or temporal traffic gaps. This behaviour pattern usually refers to a distance-dependent crossing decision, indicating that pedestrians intend to rely more on the distance to the approaching vehicle to finalise crossing decisions when the traffic gap is available <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tian et al., 2022a)</ref>. We further divided pedestrian crossing decisions into early and late crossings. The early crossing decisions did not differ significantly between yielding and non-yielding scenarios, thus supporting a hypothesis that pedestrians apply the same decision strategy at the early phase of the traffic scenario, regardless of vehicle behaviour: pedestrians make crossing decisions based on the traffic gap (e.g., distance or TTC of the approaching vehicle) and are not concerned with yielding behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(DeLucia, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pekkanen et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>We also showed that braking behaviour had an impact on pedestrian crossing behaviour. As one would expect, compared to constant speed scenarios, more pedestrians crossed the road as vehicles gave way to them in deceleration and mixed conditions. However, looking more closely at when pedestrians began crossing in scenarios with yielding, a number of different patterns were observed. A significant difference was found in the late crossings of the deceleration and mixed conditions; namely, more pedestrians crossed the road before the vehicle had fully stopped in the deceleration condition compared to the mixed condition, indicating that pedestrians were more cautious in the mixed condition. Aligned with a prior study <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dey et al., 2021)</ref>, the driving behaviour in the deceleration condition referred to a relatively early-braking style, which could encourage pedestrians to cross the road earlier. Conversely, the relatively late-braking style in the mixed condition had the opposite effect, where pedestrians tended to cross the road after the vehicle had fully stopped. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that the impact of initial speed on timings of late crossings was opposite to that in early crossings, showing that as the initial speed decreased, more pedestrians crossed the road before the vehicle had fully stopped. This pattern enhances a hypothesis that pedestrians use different strategies or cues when crossing the road early versus late in vehicle-yielding scenarios (DeLucia, 2015;</p><p>Pekkanen et al., 2022). That is, (i) when the vehicle is far from pedestrians, their crossing decisions are mainly based on the size of the traffic gap, and has been previously reported by many, the tendency for gap acceptance increases with vehicle speed for a given time gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Tian et al., 2022a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lobjois and Cavallo, 2007)</ref>. However, (ii) when the vehicle drives close, pedestrians' crossings are mainly based on the vehicle driving behaviour. This tension may help explain why the distribution of pedestrian crossing initiations in front of a yielding vehicle is bimodal. Specifically, according to the hypothesis proposed above, when pedestrians transit from one strategy to the other one, pedestrians' decision-making difficulties arise due to the contrary relationships between cues for both strategies and collision risk (generally, the collision risk is negatively correlated to the traffic gap and positively correlated to vehicle speed), causing the road crossing 'dilemma zone' <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Pawar and Yadav, 2021)</ref>. Accordingly, pedestrians prefer to cross the road when one strategy or cue is apparently safer (the traffic gap is big enough or the vehicle is about to stop) than the other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Links between road crossing behaviour and estimations</head><p>Although the deceleration rates in the mixed condition were more intense than in the deceleration condition, and we also controlled the level of visual cue, i.e.,τ , for each segment of the traffic scenarios, we showed that pedestrians could better anticipate the yielding behaviour in the deceleration condition than in the mixed condition. This was consistent with the results in the first task that more pedestrians crossed the road before the vehicle had fully stopped in the deceleration condition compared to the mixed condition.</p><p>Hence, both findings in the first and second tasks strengthen the conclusion that the early-onset braking style facilitates pedestrians to notice the yielding behaviour of vehicles and benefits their crossing decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dey et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ackermann et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Another important finding of this study is that the initial speed had a negative effect on the proportion of 'stopping' judgments. Notably, pedestrians had a tendency to interpret low vehicle speed as yielding behaviour.</p><p>For instance, under the constant speed condition with 6 s initial TTC and 25 km/h initial speed, nearly 90% of pedestrians felt that the vehicle gave way to them at the beginning. The value was still very high, i.e., 65%, for the condition with 3 s initial TTC and 25 km/h initial speed. Therefore, we suggest that pedestrians may rely on vehicle speed to estimate vehicle-yielding behaviour. It is very interesting to note that this result is in accordance with the pedestrian late crossing decision in the first task: as the initial speed decreased, more pedestrians crossed the road before the vehicle came to a complete stop.</p><p>However, as discussed above, this speed effect is exactly the opposite of the pattern in early crossings, where more pedestrians cross the road at higher initial speed conditions. This discrepancy between pedestrian early crossing behaviour and their estimations of vehicle behaviour further supports the hypothesis proposed above, whereby when the vehicle is far from pedestrians, pedestrian crossing decisions are mainly based on the size of the traffic gap rather than on estimations of vehicle-yielding behaviour. The finding is novel and significant, and it provides pretty good evidence for the hypothesis that crossing decisions and estimation of vehicle behaviour are not correlated in early phases when the traffic gap is large enough, but are correlated in late phases when vehicles drive close and yield. This notion highlights that crossing decisions and vehicle behaviour estimation are different cognitive processes that are separated or related contingent on the traffic scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Visual cue for road crossing</head><p>In addition, the visual cueτ was found to correlate significantly with the detection of yielding behaviour. With the increase in theτ , the yielding behaviour becomes more evident to pedestrians. Our findings align with previous proposals on the role ofτ as a visual cue used by pedestrians to estimate vehicle yielding behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Giles et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pekkanen et al., 2022)</ref>, and provide support for this hypothesis. However, one thing should notice that in the second task, we found pedestrians could better anticipate vehicle-yielding behaviour in the deceleration condition than in the mixed condition, whilst the levels ofτ in both scenarios were very close. The evidence accumulation theory may give a possible explanation for this phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Markkula et al., 2018)</ref>: the pedestrian crossing decision is not simply associated with the immediate value ofτ , but rather its integration over time. In the deceleration condition, since the period of time for deceleration evidence accumulation is longer than the time in the mixed condition, pedestrians may better anticipate the vehicle-yielding behaviour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Implications</head><p>We see several ways in which our results could be used to improve traffic safety. First and foremost, our findings suggest that pedestrians tend to interpret the low travelling speed of an approaching vehicle as a yielding </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Limitations and future directions</head><p>Given the complex and rich braking behaviour in actual traffic, it would be prohibitive to consider all possible driving scenarios exhaustively. As a result, this study investigated two different types of braking behaviours from a range of different initial conditions. Extending our results to other scenarios will require careful validation and possibly extensions to the interpretations we have provided here. Another methodological limitation is that participants reported their estimations orally for the second task, which may have introduced unknown cognitive biases since previous studies have suggested a potential dissociation between verbal judgments and actual actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Te Velde et al., 2005)</ref>. Furthermore, the simulated environment we used has the advantage of being safe and allowing for precise control over all experimental parameters. Although the simulated environment was highly immersive, the virtual nature of the task may have led to unpredictable behaviour patterns.</p><p>Based on the above limitations, future research may include designing complex pedestrian-AV interaction scenarios for pedestrian crossing tasks, such as approaching vehicles with varying deceleration rates. Also, since the question of why and how verbal judgment would affect actual estimation has not been addressed, it would be interesting to figure this out. Finally, although field tests have many challenges, it may be interesting to replicate the experiment in a test field and compare the difference between the real experiment and the simulation experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, pedestrians' crossing behaviour is consistent with their estimations of approaching vehicle behaviour in most cases. Pedestrians could recognise changes in driving behaviour and quickly adjust their estimations in the experiment. This finding strengthens the critical role of implicit signals in pedestrian-AV interactions. To promote the acceptance of AVs, designing for human-friendly braking manoeuvres is essential. A particularly relevant finding is that human pedestrians tend to interpret low vehicle speed as an indication of planning to stop, even if that low speed is constant. Last but not least, a separation between pedestrian crossing decisions and vehicle behaviour estimation is found when the traffic gap is large enough for early crossings. These results may need to be considered when designing pedestrian-AV interaction strategies.</p><p>to the sensation of collision threat, and can be written as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gibson, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lee, 1976)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">θ = 2 tan −1 ( w 2Z ) ⇒θ = wv (Z) 2 + w 2 /4 (A.1)</formula><p>where θ is the visual angle subtended by the approaching vehicle at the pedestrian's pupil.

As the car decelerates,θ quickly increases to -0.5, since the deceleration rate is enough to stop the vehicle in front of the pedestrian. As the vehicle comes close,θ begins increasing approximately exponentially, since the vehicle is decelerating to stop with a small distance margin, rather than exactly at the pedestrian. This means that the closer the distance, the more obvious the collision avoidance cues become. Therefore, we then assumed thatθ might be the visual cue associated with pedestrian crossing decisions in vehicle-yielding scenarios.</p><p>Appendix B.

Each of the 12 traffic scenarios was clipped at specific timestamps corresponding to when the vehicle was at four different distances from the participants. The aim of this manipulation was for the first segment of the traffic scenario to include no or subtle vehicle deceleration cues, i.e., −1 ≤τ ≤ −0.36, with increasingly clear yielding evidence in the second and third segments, i.e.,τ was belonged to[-0.36, -0.16] and[-0.16, 0.99], respectively, and very clear stopping behaviour in the fourth segment.
