			<abstract>
				<p>The aim of this work was to test the theory of good thinking and deciding in organizational context by examining the relationships between leaders&apos; actively open-minded thinking (AOT) and different employee level outcomes. Across two studies in which we surveyed managers and their subordinates, we have shown that manager&apos;s AOT positively correlated with subordinaterated decision-making quality and intellectual humility of their superiors, as well as with subordinates&apos; ratings of their teams&apos; psychological safety and their own job satisfaction and feeling of organizational support. We conclude that AOT is the disposition that predisposes some managers to patterns of thinking and behavior that are observable and highly valued by their subordinates, resulting in a range of beneficial outcomes for employees, and that it might be worthwhile to investigate how we can teach managers to think in more an actively open-minded way.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Decision-making is one of the core things a manager does and one of the core skills he or she must possess. Most of the competency-based models of managerial work puts decision-making at the forefront of the managerial duties (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bartram, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Dierdorff &amp; Rubin, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tett et al., 2000)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bartram (2005)</ref> lists deciding and making judgments among the great eight managerial competencies and <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tett et al. (2000)</ref> conclude that decision-making is the common core of all twelve models of leadership competencies that they reviewed. Yet, research indicate that managers are bad at decision-making. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nutt (2002)</ref>, who studied 400 decisions made by top managers over twenty years came to a startling conclusion that decisions made by top managers fail half of the time, although this by itself does not necessarily mean that the decision-making process was bad. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lovallo and Sibony (2010)</ref> describe the McKinsey survey of 2,207 executives of which only 28 percent said that the quality of strategic decisions in their companies was generally good, 60 percent thought that bad decisions were about as frequent as the good ones, and the remaining 12 percent thought good decisions were altogether infrequent.</p><p>In addition to establishing that managers are not particularly good decision-makers, studies have tried to uncover the reasons behind the good vs. bad decisions. First, it seems that, when making decisions, managers often rush to conclusions without searching for and considering wide enough array of possibilities or evidence, leading to mistakes such as premature commitment to an idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Nutt, 2002)</ref>, relying on the limited set of assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ketchen &amp; Craighead, 2022)</ref>, or anchoring to the first piece of information and failing to adjust one's position subsequently <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ketchen &amp; Craighead, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sibony, 2020)</ref>. Second problem seems to be selective search and interpretation of evidence. Managers, as other people, have tendency to search for and RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT overweight evidence that is in line with their current, favorite position or idea, while simultaneously avoiding and downplaying evidence that counters it. This can lead to several serious mistakes in decision-making such as: a) the escalation of commitment to the current idea even when evidence against it appears <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ketchen &amp; Craighead, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sibony, 2020)</ref>; b) constructing a coherent story from a selection of facts fueled by tendency to attend only to information that confirm the current idea/position and ignore or discount information that contradict it (i.e. confirmation bias; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kahneman et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ketchen &amp; Craighead, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Sibony, 2020)</ref>; c) the groupthink trap, as this tendency to shield oneself from counterevidence can also lead to surrounded themselves with likeminded people or those who are afraid to speak against bosses' idea <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sibony, 2020)</ref>. Finally, the third problem is the overconfidence in one's own conclusions and decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Ketchen &amp; Craighead, 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">, Sibony, 2020</ref>. If a person only attends to information that confirms his/her initial position, without ever questioning it, this will lead to accumulation of one-sided arguments and to bolstered confidence in one's conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Actively open-minded thinking as an antidote to the managerial mistakes</head><p>Given that it can be argued that these three problems underpin majority of managerial decision failures, it is remarkable that the concept of actively open-minded thinking (AOT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baron, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> 2019; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baron et al., 2015)</ref> is practically still non-existent in the managerial literature. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baron (2000)</ref> who developed this theory, AOT describes what a good thinking should look like, and it consists of three things: a) a search of information that is sufficient and thorough in proportion to the importance of the question b) active search for and fair treatment of possibilities other than the one decision-maker initially favors RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT c) confidence that is appropriate for the amount and quality (direction) of thinking done.</p><p>From this definition of AOT, it is immediately clear that this kind of thinking is the direct antidote to the three mistakes in managers' thinking that underpin majority of bad strategic decisions. This is not surprising, as the AOT was developed precisely to be a "prescriptive" theory of rationality, i.e. to prescribe how people should think and make judgments in order to counteract the most prevalent and serious cognitive biases that trump quality decision-making.</p><p>Our goal within this study is, thus, to test this theory in organizational setting, i.e., to test the benefits of managers' AOT for employee level outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empirically documented benefits of actively open-minded thinking</head><p>Outside the organizational context, there is plenty of evidence for the beneficial effects of AOT on beliefs, judgments, and decision-making. For starters, evidence suggest that AOT correlates negatively with a wide range of the usual cognitive biases identified in human decision-making, such as confirmation bias, sunk cost effect, outcome bias, belief bias and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Erceg et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stanovich &amp; West, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Stanovich et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Toplak et al., 2014)</ref>. Additionally, people higher on AOT are less prone to holding epistemically suspect beliefs such as conspiracy, superstitious or paranormal beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Erceg et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pennycook et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Svedholm &amp; Lindeman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Svedholm-Häkkinen &amp; Lindeman, 2018)</ref>, are more accurate at a variety of judgments, such as distinguishing between good and bad arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Stanovich &amp; West, 1997)</ref>, forecasting world events <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mellers et al., 2015)</ref> or distinguishing between real and fake news <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bronstein, et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Possible beneficial effects of actively open-minded thinking within organizational environment RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT</head><p>We also believe that managers that are high on AOT bring about additional beneficial outcomes relevant for the workplaces. It is reasonable to expect that managers that are open to and actively search for opposing information and evidence want to hear what others think and have to say and include them in the decision-making process. In organizational literature, such characteristic is labeled as manager's humility and refers to manifested willingness to view oneself accurately, a displayed appreciation of others' strengths and contributions, and teachability <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Owens et al., 2013</ref>). This managerial characteristic has been shown to be highly beneficial at the individual (e.g. enhanced trust in the leader, work engagement and job satisfaction, enhanced follower creativity), team (e.g. increased team performance, enhanced information sharing) and organizational level (e.g. lower turnover, higher firm performance; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Davis et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ou et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Owens et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Swain &amp; Murray, 2020)</ref>. Additionally, it seems that humble leaders tend to create a climate of psychological safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Swain, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Wang et al., 2018)</ref> which refers to the shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking, i.e. that no one will be reprimanded or ridiculed for stating their opinion, questioning and disagreeing with others or noticing mistakes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Edmondson, 1999;</ref>. Psychological safety has significant benefits for organizations and employees that again include increase in employee job performance, engagement and creativity, enhanced team learning behavior and performance, reduction in errors, increase in organizational commitment and perceived organizational support (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Newman et al., [2017]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Edmondson &amp; Lei [2014]</ref> for review, and Frazier et al., <ref type="bibr">[2017]</ref> for meta-analysis).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The present study</head><p>Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the role of manager's AOT in positive employee level outcomes. Specifically, across two studies we were interested to see how managers' AOT RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT was related to the subordinates' perceptions of the decision-making quality and intellectual humility of their managers, as well as to the subordinates' work attitudes such as job satisfaction and perceived organizational support. We planned for two studies as we were also interested to see how stable our eventual effects are, i.e. whether or not they will replicate on two independent samples and using different measures of the target constructs. In Study 2, in addition to the aforementioned variables, we also captured psychological safety as an important and positive team outcome that could be positively influenced by manager's AOT. We advanced the hypotheses that managers' AOT will be positively correlated with all the employee level outcome variables. Specifically, managers' AOT will be positively correlated with: H1: subordinate perceptions of their superiors' decision-making quality, H2: subordinate perceptions of their superiors' intellectual humility, H3: subordinate ratings of their own job satisfaction, H4: subordinate ratings of perceived organizational support, and H5: subordinate ratings of psychological safety in their teams.</p><p>In addition to this, we wanted to see whether AOT helps explain these important outcomes above the effects of the Big Five personality factors as one of the most important individual difference characteristics explaining both leadership and work outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Judge et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Schmitt, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>To investigate the incremental validity of AOT above the Big Five factors, we joined the two samples to increase the statistical power.</p><p>The main reason we wanted to conduct this incremental validity analysis relates to the practical validity of AOT for the purpose of selection for managerial positions. Big Five personality traits are routinely used in such selection processes so it makes sense to check whether practitioners can gain additional predictive power by also measuring AOT in such situations (although from RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT the conceptual perspective this might mean parsing out the valid variance in AOT). However, incremental validity analyses are problematic in several ways, mainly due to the imperfect reliabilities of the measures. One of the possible solutions is to conduct regression analysis using structural equation modelling (SEM) on latent variables that are free from measurement error <ref type="bibr">(Westfall &amp; Yarkoni, 2016)</ref>, which is what we did.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>We instructed psychology students, in exchange for extra course credits, to recruit for the study participants who were employed as managers and had at least three subordinates. The participants were informed that they will participate in a study on managerial competencies/leadership skills and were motivated to take part in the study with feedback about their leadership potential and a gift card valuable about 7$. In addition to the variables that we describe in this study, we collected additional data so that the completion of the survey took about one hour. Upon completing their own survey, managers were asked to forward the link to another survey for subordinates, along with their code that they generated and that we used to match the responses, to their subordinates. The subordinates' survey was substantially shorter than managers' and lasted about 10 minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Both managers and their subordinates participated in our study. Overall, 124 managers participated in our study (49% males and 51% females) with the mean of age M = 45.16 (SD = 10.47) and mean years of experience in managerial role of M = 12.68 (SD = 9.04). On average, RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT managers had M = 47.84 subordinates (Min = 3, Max = 1400). Education wise, our managers mostly had college degree (65%), but there were also some with only high school (27%) as well as those with PhD (8%). They were mostly employed in private sector (83%), but some also worked in state-owned company (13%) or public institution (4%). Finally, our managers mostly work in small companies with less than 50 employees (40%), followed by big companies with more than 500 employees (36%) and then middle companies with 50 to 500 employees (24%).</p><p>Not all of the managers were rated by their subordinates -we managed to obtain subordinate ratings for 95 of the managers, meaning that for 95 of the managers we were able to connect managers responses with subordinate responses. Majority of those 95 managers were rated by two subordinates (81%), some were rated by three subordinates (6%), some by four (2%), and some only had one subordinate rating (11%). In total, 190 subordinates participated in this study.</p><p>For majority of managers who received more than one peer-rating, we averaged those ratings prior to conducting the analyses. All the subsequent analyses were always done on the largest possible sample, meaning that the descriptive statistics for the managers' self-ratings were done on a larger sample (N = 124) than the descriptive statistics for the subordinate-ratings and the correlations between the self-and subordinate-ratings (N = 95).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managers</head><p>Actively open-minded thinking. AOT was measured with a 10-item questionnaire (recommended at the time by the Society for Judgment and Decision-making; https://sjdm.org/) where participants rated their level of agreement with the statements (e.g. "People should take into consideration evidence that goes against conclusions they favor" or "Changing your mind is a RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT sign of weakness" [reverse-coded]) on a 5-point scale (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree), and the final score was calculated by averaging these ratings 1 .</p><p>Cognitive ability. We measured cognitive ability with a 12 items version of the International Cognitive Ability Resource (ICAR; for details see icar-project.com and <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Condon and Revelle, 2014)</ref>. ICAR is a cognitive ability assessment tool consisting of four different types of tasks: letters and numbers series, matrix reasoning items, verbal reasoning items and three-dimensional rotation items (not used in our study). The validation of this measure is reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Condon and Revelle (2014)</ref>.</p><p>Mini International Personality Item Pool questionnaire (Mini IPIP). Mini IPIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Donnellan et al., 2006</ref>) is a 20-item personality measure, measuring the Big 5 traits each with four items.</p><p>Participants were instructed to rate the accuracy of the description (e.g. "Am the life of the party.", "Sympathize with others' feelings.", "Get chores done right away.", "Have frequent mood swings.", "Have a vivid imagination.") on a 7-point scale (1 = Completely incorrect 7 = Completely correct).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subordinates</head><p>Manager's Decision-making quality scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Wood, 2012)</ref>. This scale consisted of eight items assessing subordinates' perceptions of their managers' decision-making quality and success.</p><p>Subordinates were instructed to rate their agreement with the statements describing their manager (e.g. "The decisions my superior makes follow reason and logic" or "The decisions my superior makes end up working out well") on a five-point scale (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree).</p><p>Manager's Intellectual humility. Intellectual humility was measured with Expressed humility scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Owens et al., 2013)</ref> consisting of nine items (e.g. "This person actively seeks feedback even if it is critical", or "This person acknowledges when others have more knowledge and skills than him/herself"). The participants rated the degree to which each of the item describes their manager on a five-point scale (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree).</p><p>Job satisfaction. We measured subordinates' job satisfaction with a single item (a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 = very unsatisfied to 5 = very satisfied) assessing their satisfaction with their job, overall.</p><p>Perceived organizational support <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Eisenberger et al., 1986)</ref> was measured with eight statements (e.g. "This organization really cares about my well-being", or "The organization does not value my extra effort") for which participants indicated their level of agreement on a seven-point scale (1 = completely disagree, 7 = completely agree).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Prior to conducting main analyses, we calculated the descriptive statistics of our focal variables. This is presented in the <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. We have conducted one-tailed tests to obtain the degrees of significance as our main hypothesis was directional (i.e.,</p><p>we predicted that AOT would be positively correlated with the outcomes).  Besides being related with manager's AOT, perceived manager's decision-making quality was also positively related with his/her cognitive ability and agreeableness. Except AOT, only cognitive ability and two of the five personality factors, openness and agreeableness, showed some meaningful correlations with the measured outcomes. Other personality factors were basically unrelated with any of the outcomes. In order to replicate and extend our results, we conducted Study 2 where we used some measures that were similar to ones in this study, but also some additional measures (as explained below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>In Study 2, we collected data in two ways. We approached several companies and asked them to collaborate with us on a study about leadership competencies. Companies that agreed to RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT participate invited their managers to participate in a 3-hour workshop that within the first part included testing and in the second part a lecture on "state-of-the-art" knowledge on leadership skills. Second way was identical to Study 1 -we instructed several psychology students to recruit managers that had at least three subordinates to participate in the study.</p><p>All managers were motivated to participate in the study with the promise of personalized feedback and a gift card voucher (around 13$). The managers completed a battery of tests and questionnaires not all of which are reported in this study. It took them on average around hour and half to complete this battery. Managers were asked to provide us with email addresses of five of their subordinates who were then sent the link to a much shorter questionnaire (10 to 15 minutes long) in which they were asked to rate their manager, as well as to rate their own work attitudes (e.g. job satisfaction and perceived organizational support) and their team psychological safety. Subordinates completed several more questionnaires that we do not report here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A total of 126 managers and 335 of their subordinates participated in this study. There were 78 (62%) male and 48 (38%) female managers with mean age M = 42.08 (SD = 7.53), mean years of work experience M = 18.15 (SD = 7.36) and mean number of subordinates of M = 25.44 (Min = 3, Max = 386). Again, they mostly had college degree (66%), but there were also some with only high school (22%) as well as those with PhD (12%). Almost all of our managers worked in a private sector (94%), with minority coming from public sector or NGOs. Regarding the company size, majority of managers worked in companies with 50 to 500 employees (42%), followed by large companies with more than 500 employees (38%) and smaller companies with less than 50 employees (20%).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT</head><p>Out of 126 managers participating in the study, we managed to obtain at least one rating for 108 of them. 19% of managers were rated by five, 21% by four, 22% by three, 23% by two and 15% by only one subordinate. This time, a total of 335 subordinates participated in the study. As in the Study 1, we averaged all of the subordinates' ratings for each of the managers before conducting further analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instruments</head><p>In Study 2, we tried to constructively replicate Study 1 findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lykken, 1968)</ref>. Thus, some of the measures we used were the same as in the Study 1, but we also captured some additional constructs and for some constructs we deliberately used different measures. There is no single criterion for successful replication. At minimum, one can look at three things: whether the effects are in the same direction, whether both effects are statistically significant and whether the original effects fall within 95% CI of the replication effects (e.g. Open Science collaboration, 2015). We will use these three criteria to evaluate whether our Study 2 managed to replicate Study 1 results. Here, we describe instruments that were new or different in comparison to Study 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Managers</head><p>AOT. This time we measured AOT with currently recommended 11-item scale available at https://sjdm.org/dmidi/Actively_Open-Minded_Thinking_Beliefs.html and scoring was similar as before -calculating average of the participants' ratings on a 5-point scale (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree).</p><p>Cognitive reflection test (CRT). As a measure of cognitive ability, this time we used the cognitive reflection test (CRT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Frederick, 2005)</ref>. For this study, we developed our three items that were completely similar to the original three in structure, but differed in content as we RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT wanted to make them more work related and face-valid (e.g. "You are a manager in an auto equipment factory. If 5 machines make 5 car parts in 5 minutes, how many minutes would it take for 100 machines to make 100 car parts?"; intuitive response = 100, correct response = 5).</p><p>IPIP 50. This time we also decided to measure personality traits with more items than before to get a more reliable measure. To do that we used a Croatian translation of IPIP50 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Mlačić &amp; Šakić, 2008)</ref> which captures each of the five factors with ten items. Participants rated their levels of agreement with the statements on a 5-point scale (1 = completely incorrect, 5 = completely correct).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subordinates</head><p>Manager's AOT perceptions. This time, in addition to measuring managers' AOT, we also decided to measure their subordinates' perceptions about whether their superiors tend to think in an AOT way. We did this specifically to see if managers' AOT thinking and behavior is observable by their subordinates. The subordinates rated two statements about their superiors that we developed and that reflected the core of AOT ("My superior looks for arguments and information that could be contrary to his/her existing views and initial decisions." and "My superior changes his/her opinion if the circumstances change, that is, if there are good arguments for the change.") using a seven-point scale (1 = completely disagree, 7 = completely agree).</p><p>Manager's Decision-making quality. This time we opted for a similar, but a bit different scale used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wood and Highhouse (2014)</ref>.

We measured psychological safety with a 7-items scale developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Edmondson (1999)</ref>. Participants rated the statements ("If you make a mistake on this team, it is RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT often held against you" and "Members of this team are able to bring up problems and tough issues") on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 = "completely incorrect" to 7 = "completely correct."</p><p>The variables of manager's intellectual humility, job satisfaction and perceived organizational support were measured with identical items as those in Study 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Again, before moving to main analyses, we have calculated the descriptive statistics of our variables. This is shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>.  In general, Study 2 managers mostly agreed with the AOT principles, and their subordinates rated them as on average intellectually humble, good decision-makers. Subordinates were also relatively satisfied with their jobs, perceived their team climate to be quite safe and did not plan to leave the organization in foreseeable time. To examine the relationships between AOT and other relevant variables and outcomes, we have computed bivariate correlations between our variables. Again, to obtain the degrees of significance we have conducted one-tailed tests. We are reporting these correlations in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows that managers with higher AOT were perceived as being better decision makers, more intellectually humble and their team climate was perceived as being more psychologically safe compared to managers with lower AOT. Additionally, managers' agreement with AOT standards obviously reflected in their observable behavior judging from the relatively high positive correlation between managers' AOT and subordinates' AOT perceptions. Subordinates perceived organizational support again failed to significantly correlate with the managers' AOT, while the correlation between subordinates' job satisfaction and AOT was positive and significant this time.</p><p>RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT Unlike AOT that was consistently related with most of the outcomes in the expected directions and to expected degree, cognitive abilities (CRT) and the Big Five factors exhibited only sporadic correlations with these outcomes. Specifically, CRT was significantly correlated only with psychological safety, indicating that managers with higher cognitive abilities tend to have teams that are more psychological safe, which is generally consistent with the relationship between intelligence and leadership outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Judge et al., 2004)</ref>. Of the five personality traits, only agreeableness and openness managed to correlate significantly with any of the outcomesagreeableness with AOT perceptions, intellectual humility, perceived organizational support and psychological safety, and openness with job satisfaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis of AOT's incremental validity on joint sample</head><p>After joining two samples for the variables that were present in both studies (details of this procedure are in the Supplement), we were left with four outcomes: subordinates' ratings of managers decision-making quality and intellectual humility, perceptions of subordinates' job satisfaction and perceived organizational support. The joint sample had between N = 214 and N = 250 cases, depending on the variable.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, we conducted a SEM regression, regressing the outcomes on AOT and Big Five factors. We were interested in whether the beta ponder of AOT will remain statistically significant (one-sided tests due to directionality of hypotheses) after accounting for the effects of the Big Five factors. The results showed that the coefficient for AOT remained significant for each outcome variable except the subordinate rated decision-making quality, although the incremental variance explained by AOT was rather modest (0.018 for decision-making quality, 0.042 for intellectual humility, 0.022 for job satisfaction and 0.027 for perceived organizational support; detailed results are presented in the Supplement).</p><p>RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The guiding rationale behind our two studies was that one of the most important tasks that managers need to do is making decisions that have implications for their teams and companies.</p><p>Often, these are high stake decisions that would benefit from specific decision-making skills that are, given the literature on the management decision-making failures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nutt, 2002)</ref>, often absent. In the decision-making field of study and literature, the concept of AOT has long theoretical and empirical history. Yet, to our surprise, concept of AOT as a central construct and one of the most important decision-making individual difference variables, is completely missing from the management research. With our studies, we are hoping to fill this gap and respond to several calls to bridge the gap between decision making and industrial/organizational (I/O) research traditions that were so far largely distant and disparate (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dalal et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">Highouse et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>With a fair degree of consistency across our two studies, managers' AOT was positively related with subordinates' ratings of their managers' quality of decision-making and intellectual humility, as well as with perceived team psychological safety, support a subordinate feels he/she is getting from the organization and overall job satisfaction. Formally, looking at the three criteria for successful replication that we specified, Study 2 effects were always in the same direction as Study 1, and their 95% CI always included Study 1 effects. Regarding the statistical significance criterion, both effects of interest that were significant in Study 1 were also significant in Study 2 (AOT relationship with decision-making quality and intellectual humility ratings). Thus, we conclude that, overall, Study 2 successfully replicated and extended the results of Study 1, confirming that AOT is also relevant in the organizational context and that manager's AOT is related with a range of important outcomes. Importantly, for most of the outcomes, RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT managers' AOT was still important even after controlling for the effects of personality traits.</p><p>Granted, these effects were not large, but this is not surprising given the different sources of ratings and far from perfect indicators of the target constructs, but also the fact that the outcome variables are affected by various and different aspects that are often even outside managers'</p><p>control (e.g., employees' personality).</p><p>Still, it is also worth noting that the AOT is not a classical self-report measure as participants do not rate how often they personally think or behave in a specific way, but only to what degree they agree that specific way of thinking and behaving represents a standard of good thinking and behaving. The rationale here is that people who believe a certain type of behavior is generally good and desired will more often behave in this way, but this gap between believing that something is good behavior and actually behaving in that way could also diminish the correlations between the AOT and other variables. To obtain effects of AOT that we and the previous studies obtained testifies, in our view, of the validity of the AOT measure and of the importance of the construct for various outcomes in different domains. In short, we believe that our studies provide evidence for the importance of AOT in the organizational settings and good arguments for paying more attention to this concept in future studies.</p><p>One surprising and a bit disappointing finding from our point of view was relatively low correlation between self-rated managers' AOT and their decision-making quality as rated by their subordinates. Indeed, this was the only outcome for which AOT did not exhibit statistically significant incremental validity above the effects of personality traits on out joint sample.</p><p>However, in Study 2 we also measured whether subordinates were able to perceive their managers' AOT and obtained moderate correlations between the managers' AOT and subordinate perceptions of their AOT. This means that managers' AOT was something that was observable by RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT other people in their surroundings. It also implies that the process, rather than the outcome, of making a decision might be better criteria for assessing the quality of decision-making, as the process is under direct individual control while the outcome can be affected by many other things, outside one's control, including pure luck.</p><p>Besides positioning AOT as one of the crucial individual differences underpinning good decision-making, testifying for its benefits at a company level, our studies have shown that managers' AOT could have additional benefits at the individual and team levels. First, high AOT managers were consistently perceived as more intellectually humble meaning that their subordinates noticed that these managers value their opinions and advice, show appreciation for their contributions, and notice and praise their strengths. As noted in the introduction, studies have shown that this has many benefits for individuals, teams and organizations -higher work engagement and job satisfaction, enhanced creativity, increased team performance, lower turnover, higher firm performance, etc. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Davis et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ou et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Owens et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Swain &amp; Murray, 2020)</ref>. In addition, AOT managers tended to have teams that are more psychologically safe which also has its own benefits such as heightened job performance, engagement and creativity, enhanced team learning and reduction in errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Newman et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Edmondson &amp; Lei, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Frazier et al., 2017)</ref>. In sum, it seems that acknowledging one's own limitations, paying attention to others' thoughts and arguments, soliciting and valuing their inputs and advice and changing your mind accordingly have many benefits at every level of the organizational structure, and AOT is thinking disposition that predisposes individuals to think and behave in this way more. Thus, the benefits of managers' AOT permeate organization through different channels and mechanisms not limited solely to enhanced quality of decision making.</p><p>RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications</head><p>One practical implication of our results is that it could be possible to teach managers to make better and more beneficial decisions for their organizations and its employees by teaching them what is AOT and how to think in actively open-minded way. Although there are individual differences in propensity towards AOT, as AOT represents the standards of good thinking, it is in principle teachable. Some of the previous studies showed some promise in this regard. For example, Perkins (2019) showed that it is possible to teach students to develop their arguments better, specifically by including other-side perspective, which is something that does not come naturally to people. Gurcay-Morris (2016) showed that a short, one hour long, AOT online module managed to increase other-side thinking and somewhat decrease overconfidence in one's own judgments. Thus, increasing managers' AOT holds promise as an avenue not only to enhanced quality of decision-making at the high levels of organization, but also to increased psychological safety of the teams and engagement and satisfaction of employees, with all of the benefits these outcomes bring. This is definitely something worth pursuing in future scientific endeavors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>The first limitation relates to AOT and outcome measures. The current AOT measure that assesses one's beliefs about proper standards of thinking is, in a way, a proxy for one's "true" tendency towards AOT. Although such measure has its advantages, it is also possible that there exists a gap between what someone believes and what someone does, possibly lowering the correlations between AOT and outcomes. Other approaches to measuring AOT in organizational contexts could be investigated in the future (for example, the AOT situational judgment test that is currently being developed by our research group; Vrhovnik, 2022).</p><p>RUNNING HEAD: TESTING THE THEORY OF GOOD THINKING AND DECIDING IN MANAGEMENT</p><p>The other limitation relates to the incremental validity of AOT over and above cognitive ability.</p><p>In our analyses we have not included a measure of cognitive ability in our incremental validity analysis. The reason for this is simply that we used different ability measures across the studies and therefore could not merge them in a joint sample, and doing incremental analysis on separate samples would not make much sense due to low sample size. In other words, statistical strength of such analyses would be too low to warrant reliable conclusions, and SEM regression especially requires high sample size (Westfall &amp; Yarkoni, 2016). However, as both ability measures (ICAR and CRT) exhibited smaller correlations with the outcomes than AOT, we suspect that the AOT would still be able to explain incremental variance had the ability measures been included in the analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, we have conducted two studies in which we demonstrated benefits of managers'</p><p>AOT at many organizational levels. Specifically, we have showed that the higher the manager's AOT, the better their decision-making capabilities and the higher their intellectual humility as judged by their subordinates. Furthermore, managers with higher AOT tended to have teams that were more psychologically safe and employees that were more satisfied with their jobs and that felt more supported by their organization. We argue that the AOT is the disposition that predisposes some managers to patterns of thinking and behavior that are observable and highly valued by their subordinates, resulting in a range of beneficial outcomes. Thus, one promising way forward is to develop and test educational interventions aimed to teach AOT to highly positioned organizational leaders with a bid to enhance the quality of decision making in the organization, but also to improve their employees' work-related attitudes, thus affecting different organizational outcomes in positive way.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Note. ωt = Omega total reliability; AOT = Actively open-minded thinking; CRT = Cognitive reflection test; AOT p. = Manager's AOT perceptions; DMQ = Manager's decision-making quality; IH = Manager's intellectual humility; JS = Job satisfaction; POS = Perceived organizational support; PS = Psychological safety.</figDesc></figure>
