				<p>Counterfactual learning, which refers to learning from what could have happened under different circumstances, is crucial for understanding decision-making in humans. Recent studies have well characterized the computational and neural processes underlying this aspect of learning. However, little is known about the temporal dynamics of attentional allocation towards the different alternatives faced by individuals, and their consequences. The present study explores the role of gaze and pupil dilation as potential indicators of counterfactual thinking during reinforcement learning tasks. By examining how these physiological measures correlate with the cognitive processes involved in evaluating both experienced and forgone outcomes, the research provides insights into the complex dynamics of human counterfactual learning. We recorded the gaze and pupil size of 36 participants engaged in a computer-based 2-arm bandit task with full information. The participants faced scenarios where they made choices and were then shown both the actual outcomes and hypothetical outcomes of unchosen options. While the overall pattern of allocation typically involved a first fixation on the factual outcome followed by a subsequent one on the counterfactual outcome, this pattern was affected differently by both outcomes&apos; value. On the other hand, pupil size reflected the outcome valence of the chosen option as well as the similarity between outcomes. These findings suggest that gaze dynamics and pupil dilation serve as effective biomarkers of counterfactual processing, reflecting the cognitive load and confirmation bias associated with such processes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Counterfactual learning is a crucial and potent aspect of human cognition, enabling individuals to learn not only from their actual experiences but also from hypothetical scenarios that could have occurred if different decisions had been made. In laboratory tasks, counterfactual feedback has been found to enhance learning performance substantially <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . People may learn from the counterfactual information itself or from the experience of receiving it. For example, fictive information about unmade investments can influence future financial decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , and the anticipation of future regrets can shape gambling attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . Research has shown that the brain computes fictive prediction errors for counterfactual outcomes alongside prediction errors for experienced outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> .</p><p>These two types of prediction errors, integral to the learning process, are sign-dependent and exhibit opposite patterns, and have been found to align with a confirmation bias hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> . Although the temporality of brain activity underlying counterfactual learning has been explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , little is known about the temporal dynamics of attention allocation towards counterfactual information during the counterfactual learning process. How are the outcomes of unchosen actions taken into account by humans, and how does this depend on the outcomes of the chosen ones? Understanding these dynamics is crucial for providing deeper insights into how to present feedback in an optimal manner to capture peoples attention effectively.</p><p>Over the last two decades, robust empirical evidence has emphasized the impact of attention allocation on value-based decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and reinforcement learning (RL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> . In RL tasks, humans allocate more attention to options with higher estimated values and uncertainties, directly influencing their decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . They also focus on the relevant dimensions of presented stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> and on the relevant stimuli when surrounded by irrelevant ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . At the outcome stage, attention has been found to be preferentially directed towards outcomes that generate the greatest surprise, measured as unsigned prediction errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> and to the momentarily relevant dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . Subjects in these studies focus on information relevant to the task at hand and particularly on the feedback of their chosen option. However, how would subjects allocate their attention if they were given counterfactual feedback? This information would be relevant to the task while not resulting from a decision made by the subject.</p><p>In the present study, we used a 2-arm bandit task with complete information <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , where participants received feedback on each trial about both the outcome of the chosen option and the outcome of the unchosen one. The latter represents the counterfactual feed-back of their decision, or what they would have received if they had selected a different option. Subjects performed the task while wearing an eye-tracking device, allowing us to record their gaze and pupil size throughout the experiment. To our knowledge, this is the first study analysing the dynamics of attention allocation during counterfactual learning.</p><p>First, we replicated recent behavioral and computational findings showing that subjects update their expectations differently depending on both the type of information received (factual vs. counterfactual) and the sign of the prediction errors (positive vs. negative). This pattern is interpreted as a confirmation bias in reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . We then show that fixation at the feedback stage follow a specific pattern with a first fixation on the factual outcome and the second one on the counterfactual outcome. Interestingly, only the fixation on the counterfactual outcome depended on the values of the feedback. Both the factual and counterfactual outcomes' values impacted the attention allocation towards the counterfactual feedback, and this in an opposite direction, supporting the confirmation bias hypothesis. We also show that a similar interactions between the two outcomes impacted pupil size during the feedback process.Consistent with a recent study, we found that the value effect on pupil size did not reflect pure surprise <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , but instead was sign-and choice-dependent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioural task and physiological recordings</head><p>Subjects performed a 2-arm bandit task with full information replicated from <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1)</ref>. In this task, subjects must learn through trial and error which of the two options presented on the computer screen is more rewarding. The time course of the trial is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.A. After making a decision, subjects are presented with the outcome for both the chosen and the unchosen options (i.e. 1 or −1). In some conditions, one option is better than the other and leads more often to a positive outcome; in other conditions, the options are equally rewarding, or the most rewarding option becomes the least rewarding after half of the trials.</p><p>While performing the task, subjects wore an eye-tracking device that recorded both their pupil size and gaze. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">+ f g +1 -1 f g</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects are biased towards confirmatory information</head><p>We modelled subjects' behaviour in the task with a reinforcement learning model able to account for confirmatory biases in valuebased decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . The model compounds two learning rates, one for confirmatory prediction errors <ref type="bibr">(PEs)</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2A</ref> bar and scatter plots).</p><p>Additionally, we found that subjects exhibited typical behavioural signature of confirmation bias in reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> which include persevering behaviours after an environmental change ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>, middle panel) and a very high preferred response rate in environments with no best options ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B,</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>, middle panel). The second signature refers to the preferential selection of a unique option when both are equally rewarding. This tendency is present in every subjects but is accentuated in the most heavily biased ones (low=0.59ś0.10, high=0.74ś0.17, t34=-3.26ś0.14, p&lt;0.01, two-sample two-sided ttest, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>, right panel). Note that in conditions with a best response, the two groups have similar performance (low=0.86ś0.12, high=0.89ś0.10, t34=-0.82ś0.11, p=0.41, two-sample twosided ttest, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>, left panel). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Temporality of counterfactual feedback processing</head><p>While subjects performed the task, they wore an eye-tracking device that recorded their gaze and pupil size. Focusing on their gaze first, we analyzed the targets of their attention allocation around the decision onset and the feedback presentation ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A)</ref>.</p><p>Replicating previous results 14, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> , we found that subjects looked preferentially at the option to be chosen in the moment preceding their choice (Pchosen=0.75ś0.12, t35=12.68ś0.12, p&lt;0.001, one-sample two-sided ttest, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A)</ref>. Regarding the feedback onset ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref>), we found that subjects first attended to the factual outcome for about 375ms before attending to the counterfactual outcome for an average of 550ms. These phases were followed by a new fixation on the factual outcome until the end of the feedback presentation (i.e. 1.5s). Interestingly, we found that the timing of this fixation pattern was modulated by both the factual and the counterfactual outcomes' value. While the initial fixation on the factual outcome was not affected by either outcomes' value, the subsequent fixation on the counterfactual outcome was. The factual outcome value was positively linked with a decrease in the time spent exploring the counterfactual outcome ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3C</ref>, upper left panel), while the opposite was true for the value of the counterfactual outcome ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3C, upper right panel)</ref>. In other words, subjects receiving a positive outcome from their decisions tended to decrease their attention allocation to the counterfactual outcome, and the same was observed when subjects were facing a negative counterfactual outcome.</p><p>To further analyse this effect, we derived a general linear model (GLM1) with the gaze side (chosen vs. unchosen options) as the explained variable. We used as predictors factual and counterfactual outcomes as well as a third variable encoding the similarity between both outcomes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3C</ref>, lower left panel). We fitted the model at each time point (every 50ms) of our signal from 0.5s before the outcomes' delivery to 2.5s after the delivery. Confirming our descriptive results, we found significant effects of the factual and counterfactual outcomes on the gaze side at the moment of the counterfactual outcome exploration. These effects are in opposite directions with positive factual outcomes driving the gaze away from the counterfactual feedback and positive counterfactual outcome driving the gaze towards it. In other words, subjects tended to ignore counterfactual option's outcome after being rewarded, and even more so if this counterfactual outcome was negative. On the contrary, subjects tended to explore more the counterfactual outcome following a negative factual outcome, even more so when this counterfactual outcome was positive. Additionally, we observed a positive effect of outcome similarity on attention to the chosen outcome. Specifically, when participants were presented with a counterfactual outcome similar to the factual one, they tended to pay less attention to it, regardless of whether the outcome was positive or negative.</p><p>This pattern of attention allocation modulated by outcome values aligns with the confirmation bias hypothesis in reinforcement learning. Indeed, both factual and counterfactual outcomes that confirm subjects' choices (i.e., positive factual outcomes and negative counterfactual outcomes) tend to reduce the attention given to the potential outcomes that could have resulted from alternative decisions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3C</ref>, lower right panel illustrates this, showing that the attention directed toward counterfactual outcomes decreases as the confirmatory nature of the outcome combination increases. In other words, the more confirmatory the outcome combination, the less attention is paid to what might have been.</p><p>Interestingly, the difference in attention towards the factual outcome between the most confirmatory and most disconfirmatory situations was directly linked to how strongly subjects relied on confirmatory feedback. We found a positive correlation between the peak difference in attention defined as the average difference in attention towards the factual outcome between the most confirmatory and disconfirmatory situations, from 1 second to 1.5 seconds after outcome presentation and the confirmatory learning rate αc (rho=0.47, p&lt;0.01). Notably, this difference was not correlated with the other model parameters, such as the softmax temperature (rho=-0.21, p=0.21) or the disconfirmatory learning rate α d (rho=0.28, p=0.09), underscoring the specific link between attention and confirmatory feedback in the learning process. This specific link also remains significant when all model parameters are included as explanatory variables in a single GLM, with the peak difference in attention as the dependent variable (Supplementary <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pupil size does not encode counterfactual outcomes alone</head><p>Both factual and counterfactual outcome values influenced attention allocation during feedback presentation. However, only factual outcome value had a direct impact on pupil size. First, we observed a biphasic pupil size response both around the decision ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4A</ref>) and around the outcome delivery ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4B)</ref>, characterized by early dilation followed by late constriction, consistent with recent findings ( 29 ). Notably, this response was directly modulated by factual outcome value ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4C, upper left panel)</ref>,</p><p>while counterfactual outcome value did not produce a significant effect ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4C, upper right panel)</ref>. Negative factual outcomes were associated with reduced late constriction ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4C, upper left panel)</ref>, whereas counterfactual outcomes had no significant overall impact on pupil size. To further validate these observations, we developed a new general linear model (GLM2), with normalized pupil size as the dependent variable. We used as predictors factual and counterfactual outcomes as well as a third variable encoding the similarity between both outcomes. The model was applied at each time point of the pupil size signal (every 50 ms). tual outcome value on pupil size, while counterfactual outcome value had no significant direct effect. We also observed a strong negative effect of outcome similarity on pupil size. Specifically, when participants were presented with a counterfactual outcome similar to the factual one, their pupil size was smaller compared to when the outcomes were dissimilar, regardless of whether the outcomes were positive or negative.</p><p>To further investigate the role of counterfactual outcome values in modulating pupil size, we extended our analysis to explore inter-  action effectsspecifically, the effect of similaritybetween factual and counterfactual outcomes. Different combinations of these outcomes elicited distinct pupil responses ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4C, lower right panel)</ref>. As expected, combinations involving a positive factual outcome resulted in smaller pupil sizes compared to those involving a negative factual outcome. However, the pupil response also varied based on whether the counterfactual outcome was identical to or different from the factual one. In particular, when the counterfactual outcome was identical to the factual one, pupil size tended to decrease, regardless of the valence of the outcomes.</p><p>In contrast to the attention results, we did not observe any significant correlations between the peak difference in pupil dilation defined as the average difference in pupil size between the most confirmatory and disconfirmatory situations, from 1 second to 1.5 seconds after outcome presentation and any of the confirmation model parameters. Specifically, there were no correlations with the softmax temperature (rho=-0.13, p=0.44), the confirmarory learning rate αc (rho=-0.02, p=0.92), or disconfirmatory learning rate α d (rho=-0.02, p=0.89).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>By combining a reinforcement learning task and eye-tracking, we demonstrated that attention allocation towards counterfactual options depends on both the perceived value of these options and the perceived value of the chosen option. In other words, subjects tend to attend less to alternatives after experiencing a positive outcome and when the outcomes from the alternatives themselves were negative. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at analyzing attentional allocation towards counterfactual events within a reinforcement learning task.</p><p>First we replicated recent behavioural and computational findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> , demonstrating that subjects learning in a bandit task, exhibited a confirmation bias while updating the different options' value. In other words, they tended to consider more confirmatory outcomes (i.e. positive factual and negative counterfactual outcomes) than disconfirmatory outcomes (i.e. negative factual and positive counterfactual outcomes) when updating their expectations. Using a variant of the Q-learning model, we found that their learning rate for confirmatory prediction errors was significantly greater than their learning rate for disconfirmatory prediction errors.</p><p>Additionally, we found that subjects exhibited the two key behavioural signatures of confirmatory reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . Indeed, the stronger their confirmation bias the slower they were to adapt to a change in the environment contingencies. Moreover, a higher confirmation bias was also associated with a higher preferred response rate in the symmetric conditions. Most heavily biased subjects were then more prone both to stick with previously learned options in changing environment and to focus on a unique option in environments with equally valued option.</p><p>We then analysed how subjects allocated their attention at the outcome stage using gaze tracking. We identified a general pattern where participants first fixated on the chosen option, even after outcome revelation, followed by a fixation on the alternative outcomes, and sometimes a return to the chosen option. Subjects then explored first the factual outcomes and only after the counterfactual ones. Specifically, this pattern was modulated by the value of both the factual and counterfactual outcomes. Indeed, while the fixation on the factual outcomes was unaltered by the latter, the fixation on the counterfactual outcome depended on both the values of both the factual and the counterfactual outcomes, and this in an opposite direction. A positive factual outcome tended to diminish the time spent observing the counterfactual outcome, while a positive counterfactual outcome tended to increase this time.</p><p>Interestingly, the similarity between the factual and counterfactual outcomes also influenced attention allocation towards decision feedback. Specifically, when the counterfactual outcome mirrored the factual one, participants allocated less attention to the counterfactual outcome. Conversely, when the outcomes differed, attention to the counterfactual outcome increased. This suggests that, beyond outcome valence, outcome similarity negatively impacts the exploration of alternatives. When the outcomes do not indicate any valuable information for future decision-making (e.g. a difference between the two outcomes of a binary decision), individuals are less likely to invest time in exploring alternative scenarios. Recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> have shown that, in reinforcement learning tasks involving multi-dimensional stimuli, participants focused on the dimensions that were momentarily relevant to the task.</p><p>Similarly, in our study, participants tended to pay more attention to alternatives when their outcomes differed from those of chosen options, making them relevant for future decisions in a binary choice task.</p><p>The observed attention allocation pattern suggests a link between attention to alternatives and the extent to which outcomes confirm the choices made, aligning with the confirmation bias hypothesis in reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> . This hypothesis posits that humans tend to focus more on information that confirms their recent choice, namely positive outcomes for the chosen option and negative outcomes for the unchosen option. Our gaze analysis indicates that attention allocated to alternatives is inversely related to the degree of outcome confirmation. When all available information supports one's decision, minimal attention is directed toward exploring what could have been. This is of prime importance, as it suggests that the selective attention characteristic of confirmation bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> can be observed even when individuals are confronted with neutral stimuli with which they have no prior history of interaction. Previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> have suggested that disconfirmatory information is less likely to be considered in the updating of future expectations in reinforcement learning task. Our study takes this a step further, indicating that alternatives tend to be simply ignored when current outcomes appear to confirm one's decision, and that the degree of this selective ignorance seems to be directly linked to how much emphasis is placed on newly observed confirmatory information.</p><p>Regarding pupil size, we observed that it was directly influenced by the value of the factual outcome after it was delivered. Pupil size is closely linked to changes in central arousal states and is commonly used as a marker for perceived task difficulty, cognitive load, neural gain , and an indicator of surprise <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> . In our study, a negative factual outcome was associated with pupil dilation one second after outcome delivery. This effect was further modulated by the counterfactual outcome, depending on whether it was similar or dissimilar to the factual one. Specifically, a dissimilar counterfactual outcome tended to increase pupil dilation, while a similar one tended to decrease it. These findings suggest that the combination of a negative factual outcome and a positive counterfactual outcome representing a disconfirmatory scenario elicited the highest level of pupil dilation. For a subject biased toward confirmatory information, this scenario is particularly surprising, as the chosen option was unfavorable while the dismissed option was favorable. This also aligns with recent research showing that feedback on the most erroneous decisions leads to the greatest pupil dilation in perceptual choice tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> . In our reinforcement learning task with full information, the presence of the counterfactual outcome introduces additional layers of perceived successes and errors. The disconfirmatory scenario (i.e., a negative factual outcome paired with a positive counterfactual outcome) represents the highest level of perceived error in relation to the most recent decision, which is in turn likely to induce the greatest level of surprise in participants trying to learn the task.</p><p>Counterfactual information in reinforcement learning task allow better performance by mitigating the need for exploration. Interestingly, this information is no treated equally as the factual information. At the computational level, confirmation bias implies an opposite valence-dependent treatment of outcomes between factual and counterfactual ones. We tend to consider more positive experienced outcomes and negative foregone ones and vice versa. Moreover the allocation of attention towards counterfactual information is directly affected by both received information and the counterfactual information itself. We are less likely to pay attention to alternatives when we already received satisfaction from our own decision and this particularly if they appear similar. Finally, counterfactual information impact the individual arousal level by increasing or decreasing the level of perceived error of the recently made decision, the most disconfirmatory combination eliciting the most pupil dilation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p>40 subjects (20 males and 20 females) have been recruited through LMU's mailing lists and recruiting platforms, and tested one at a time in our experimental laboratory. The inclusion criteria were: vaccination against Covid-19, normal vision (i.e. no glasses, no contact lenses, no eye irritations), no neurological disorders, no physical discomfort. The exclusion criteria were: a performance in the task not significantly higher than chance level, a task not fully completed, data recording failure or any kind of data loss. Subjects perform the task while wearing an eye-tracking device recording both their gaze and pupils size, further details are given below in the Methods subsection 4.4 Pupillometry. No subjects has been excluded based on performance. However, 3 subjects have been excluded due to storage failure and 1 for excessive noise in the gaze data recording. 36 subjects have been used for the analyses presented in this paper.</p></div>

The Q-value of the chosen option Q ch is updated such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Q t+1 ch = Q t ch +        αc * P E t ch , if P E t ch &gt; 0 α d * P E t ch , if P E t ch &lt; 0</formula><p>while the unchosen option Qun is updated such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">Q t+1 un = Q t un +        α d * P E t un , if P E t un &gt; 0 αc * P E t un , if P E t un &lt; 0</formula><p>where αc is the learning rate for confirmatory information, α d is the learning rate for disconfirmatory information and PE the prediction error associated to related option. The decision is made through a softmax policy. The probability of choosing option 1 over option 2 at time t is computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">P t 1 = e Q t 1 /β e Q t 1 /β + e Q t 2 /β</formula><p>Where β is the softmax temperature. The probability of choosing option 2 is computed equivalently. The model is fitted by negative log-likelihood minimisation using the fmincon function in Matlab.</p></div>

As with the visual stimulus on the monitor and the user input (participants key presses), pupil data recording (via the Pupil Capture software <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>) were also administered through our experiment scripts, designed and written in Python using the PsychoPy software <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . The Pupil Capture software was configured to run the real-time pupil detection and eye video recording at 120Hz.</p><p>After the recording session, pupil data preprocessing steps included the rejection of physiologically invalid data (pupil size out of the range of 1 to 9 millimeters), the rejection of blinks (flagged by the software), the rejection of data points recorded with low technical confidence (also flagged by the software), the rejection of data points preceding or following physiologically impossible dilation speed, merging the data from both eyes into one time series and smoothing the merged time series using a 4th-order low-pass filter with the cutoff frequency of 4Hz. Following the preprocessing steps, data was epoched using trial triggers, interpolated in a backward method, Z-scored in each block, resampled with a frequency of 20Hz and baseline-corrected subtractively.</p></div>

The bar plot shows the probability of receiving a positive reward for both options in each condition: asymmetric (2), symmetric (1) and reversal (1). The later condition includes a reversal of reward contingencies in the second half of the trials. The experiment consist of 2 blocks of 4 conditions of 24 trials.</figDesc></figure>

The bar plot (left panel) represents the average values of the confirmatory and disconfirmatory learning rates fitted on subjects. The scatter plot represents these learning rates separately for each subjects. The diagonal indicates no bias and points above the diagonal indicates a confirmation bias. Colours indicate the two different group of subjects: low bias vs. high bias (median split on the normalized difference between the two learning rates). Dots represent individual learning rate pairs and areas the median split. B. Performance and behavioural signatures. The plots represent the evolution of the percentage of correct response (left panel) in conditions where there is a best option, first correct response (middle panel) in conditions with a reversal, and preferred response (right panel) in conditions with no best response, across trials. Colours indicate the two different groups of subjects: low bias vs. high bias. Error bars and shaded areas represent the standard error to the mean.</figDesc></figure>
