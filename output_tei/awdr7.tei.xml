			<abstract>
				<p>Does the utility of an outcome influence people&apos;s assessment of risk and uncertainty? Growing evidence suggests that people often rely on mental simulations to evaluate probability and risky events. However, prior experimental findings offer conflicting predictions about how utility biases this mental sampling process. Across four experiments (total N =206, with Experiment 4 pre-registered), we investigated the influence of utility using a random generation paradigm. These responses were then compared to probability judgments and predictions. While we identified individual differences, the majority of participants exhibited neutrality, with no systematic impact of utility on their sampling distributions. Nevertheless, biases emerged under specific conditions, including a preference for smaller or more probable outcomes as the starting point of simulations and optimism in single-response predictions. Additionally, we found evidence suggesting that probability judgments, predictions, and random generation tasks may rely on a shared underlying mental process. Our findings suggest that models of judgment and decision-making should account for individual differences in utility influences, particularly distinguishing between unbiased sampling and optimistic sampling-the selective over-representation of high-utility outcomes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Does Utility Bias Mental Simulations of Risky Events? Introduction</head><p>Imagine participating in a raffle where the total number of slips and the number of winning slips are known. How do you perceive your chances of winning? The subjective representations about probabilities play a crucial role in how we understand and navigate uncertainty. Current research suggests that humans do not directly represent or calculate probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1973)</ref>. Instead, this process is more likely implemented through a sampling mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sanborn &amp; Chater, 2016)</ref>. Models based on this sampling framework (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Costello &amp; Watts, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Zhu et al., 2020</ref>) approximate normative reasoning under ideal conditions when sufficient cognitive resources are available 1 . These models have successfully accounted for several observed phenomena in probability judgments, including conservatism in judgment and the fallacies in the conjunction and disjunction probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Costello &amp; Watts, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Erev et al., 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Despite advances in the sampling processes theories, little empirical research has explicitly investigated how people draw samples from risky events with outcomes that differ in utility. For instance, consider a gamble with a 50/50 chance of winning £5 or nothing-while the two outcomes share equal probabilities, their utilities differ significantly. This raises an important question: do explicit utilities influence the probabilities with which outcomes are mentally sampled, and if so, in what ways do they shape this sampling process?</p><p>Allowing for two possible directions of bias (undersampling or oversampling) in two differing domains (gains and losses), we can outline four biased hypotheses and one unbiased neutrality hypothesis, as illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. If the aim of a sampling process is to form accurate beliefs, and if individuals trust the probabilities they are provided, then utilities should ideally have no influence on what comes to mind. This idea is referred to as the Neutrality hypothesis. However, there is currently remarkably little empirical evidence to support it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Hypotheses of the sampling process considering the influence of domains (gains and losses) and potential biases, with citations of empirical studies that can be explained by the certain biased sampling process.</p><p>Instead, it has been found that prior beliefs about outcome distributions can influence probability judgments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Yu and Lagnado (2012)</ref> demonstrated that experimentally induced priors can shape probability judgments. In the absence of such experimentally induced priors, judgments may rely on the prior beliefs derived from environmental statistics. For instance, larger gains, such as national lotteries, are generally less common than smaller gains. Under these conditions, a Centralisation bias might emerge.</p><p>Supporting this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Pleskac and Hertwig (2014)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hoffart et al. (2019)</ref> found that, under uncertainty, people tend to assign lower probability to higher reward, believing that larger rewards were less likely than smaller ones. While not empirically tested in these studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Pleskac and Hertwig (2014)</ref> argued that people would, in line with the notion of a fair bet, think that larger losses would be less likely than smaller losses.</p><p>Alternatively, a resource-rational perspective shifts focus from using external information to refine uncertain probabilities to improving decision-making when only a limited number of outcomes can be sampled. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lieder, Griffiths, and Hsu (2018)</ref> argued that in such cases, preferential sampling of outcomes with the greatest absolute utility difference from the mean outcome can improve the quality of the decision. For example, in Russian Roulette, decision-making improves if the decision maker prioritises sampling the fatal outcome, ensuring this possibility is not overlooked. Empirical evidence supports the idea that extreme outcomes, both extreme gains and extreme losses, are recalled first and at rates higher than their objective probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ludvig et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Madan et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Madan et al., , 2021</ref>. However, this pattern has not been studied for the descriptive gambles investigated in our study. We refer to this tendency as the Polarisation hypothesis.</p><p>There is also modest empirical evidence supporting the Pessimism hypothesis. This evidence comes from a probability judgment task in Experiment 2 of de Molière and Harris's study <ref type="bibr">(2016)</ref>, where participants estimated the probability of three risky events that shared the same objective probability but differed in their outcomes: gaining money, losing money, or a neutral condition with no monetary consequences. Their findings showed that, compared to the neutral condition, probability estimates were higher in the loss-money scenario and lower in the gain-money scenario (shown in their <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). One possible explanation for this tendency is the concept of defensive pessimism <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Norem &amp; Cantor, 1986)</ref>, where individuals lower their expectations to prepare for and mitigate potential disappointment in an uncertain future.</p><p>Finally, the Optimism hypothesis has the strongest empirical support, primarily from studies using the "Marks paradigm" <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Marks, 1951)</ref>. In this task, participants were presented with a deck of cards containing both blank and marked cards. The proportion of marked cards varied between 10% and 90%, and participants were informed of the exact proportion before the experiment. They were then asked to draw a card at random and predict whether it would be marked or blank. The marked card could take on one of three meanings depending on the scenario: winning a point (desirable condition), losing a point (undesirable condition), or being meaningless (neutral condition). Participants were more likely to predict a marked card in the desirable condition and less likely in the undesirable condition compared to the neutral scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Irwin, 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Marks, 1951</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr">Krizan and</ref> Windschitl, 2007 for a review). While this task uses prediction rather than probability estimates as the measure-and studies have shown that likelihood judgments do not reliably exhibit Optimism (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Park et al., 2022)</ref>-it may also be limited to cases where probabilities are equal <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Krizan &amp; Windschitl, 2007)</ref>. Unlike other hypotheses, Optimism lacks a clear normative justification but could be explained by the idea that individuals derive utility from the outcomes they imagine.</p><p>In general, the literature on sampling biases is inconsistent, with different researchers employing various measures that produce divergent results. For instance, predictions tend to exhibit optimism, while probability judgments are often neutral or vary in direction. Critically, past work has generally not considered the time course of these biases: While these are often characterised as static effects, recent work on sequential sampling models has proposed potential temporal dynamics in mental processes, meaning early responses may systematically differ from later ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lieder, Griffiths, M. Huys, &amp; Goodman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Zhu et al., 2024)</ref>. This particularly applies to the first value considered: research on anchoring effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref> has suggested the starting point of the sampling process may be influenced by especially salient external values <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lieder, Griffiths, M. Huys, &amp; Goodman, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Spicer et al., 2022)</ref> and so may be particularly prone to utility biases. Furthermore, individual differences have received limited attention. Most studies focus on testing broad hypotheses using group means <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Park et al., 2022</ref> is an exception as they investigated the proportion of the biased individuals), which can obscure variability among participants. For instance, while many individuals may exhibit Neutrality, the group mean might appear biased due to a small subset of participants better aligned with another hypothesis.</p><p>To address these gaps in the past works, we adapted a paradigm that calls for repeated mental simulation, the random generation task <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baddeley, 1966)</ref>. In contrast to the Marks paradigm in which participants are asked for a single prediction of a lottery, in random generation, participants are asked to repeatedly mentally simulate the outcomes of a lottery in time with a metronome, for example by imagining drawing a slip of paper with a numerical value from a hat, reporting the numerical value, replacing the slip of paper, shuffling, and repeating the process. Random generation was originally used to study working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baddeley, 1998)</ref> and the concept of randomness of people <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Nickerson, 2002)</ref>, and recently it has been adapted to explore the mental sampling process itself, such as stereotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Falben et al., 2024)</ref>, and events with equal and unequal probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Castillo et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Leon-Villagra et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>We investigated the biases depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> across four experiments using the random generation paradigm, comparing its results to probability judgments (Experiments 1 and 2) and predictions (Experiments 3 and 4). To enhance the reliability of our findings, we collected extensive data from each participant, enabling us to more accurately determine which hypothesis their responses aligned with. Specifically, we asked participants to imagine playing a gamble repeatedly, and then say out loud or write down the outcome they imagined. Critically, we manipulated the meaning of these values such that in one condition, participants were told they would represent winning points, in another losing points or that they were just numbers (i.e., not associated with winning or losing).</p><p>The first two experiments employed this design but used different probability distributions. Experiment 1 involved a uniform distribution, represented by drawing slips of paper from a bag, whereas Experiment 2 employed a binomial distribution, illustrated by counting the number of heads after simultaneously tossing ten coins. Experiments 3 and 4 aimed to test the generalizability of the findings from the first two experiments.</p><p>Specifically, in Experiment 3, we used a drawing-card scenario based on the Marks paradigm to evaluate whether our findings in Experiment 1 and 2 were due to the phrasing of instructions, the number of possible outcomes, or the number of mental simulations participants were asked to perform. Similarly, we conducted Experiment 4 in the laboratory with more salient monetary incentives to test the boundary conditions of the findings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>In Experiment 1, we employed the random generation paradigm to investigate how participants mentally simulate a gamble with equally probable outcomes. The experiment included three domains: gains, losses, and a neutral control condition. Our primary objectives were: (1) to assess whether the generated histograms align with participants' probability judgments, (2) to determine whether changes in the domains influence the generated results, and (3) to investigate whether the initial number generated is different from the latter ones.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A total of 30 participants (8 women, 22 men; age: M = 22.0 years, SD = 3.6) took part in the study. All participants were recruited via the University of Warwick participant pool (https://warwick.sona-systems.com/). Participants were reimbursed with Amazon vouchers (a show-up fee of £3 and a random bonus). The bonus ranged from 0p to 20p, and the expected value of the bonus is 10p. Ethical approval was given by the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee (HSSREC) at the University of Warwick.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design and Materials</head><p>The experiment employed a within-subject design, incorporating three variants of a random generation task through three distinct domains: gain, loss, and control. All the participants began with the control domain, and the order of the subsequent gain and loss domains was counterbalanced across subjects.</p><p>In each domain, participants were presented with a set of 11 slips of paper of identical size representing the numbers 0 to 10. Domains differed in the value of these numbers: In the gain domain, slips were labeled as "winning [x] points"; in the loss domain, slips were labeled as "losing [x] points", where "x" represents each of the numbers 0 to 10; in the control domain, slips were only labeled with their respective number.</p><p>Participants were asked to imagine "drawing a slip out from a bag, saying the number or the outcome on it out loud, putting it back, shuffling, then repeating the process", following the instructions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Baddeley (1966)</ref>. To help participants understand the instructions, the experimenter visually illustrated the process without revealing the slip contents. Importantly, in the gain and loss domains, participants were asked to articulate the full phrase "winning" or "losing [x] points" during every response to ensure they did not forget the domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The experiment was conducted online using Microsoft Teams, which was also used to record participants' audio. The experiment began with an explanation of the random generation task, including a visual demonstration of the drawing process using physical slips by the experimenter.</p><p>The main procedure is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The experiment contained three blocks, one for each of the three domains. Each block began by showing a photograph of the set of slips from that domain. Participants were then asked to generate draws from that set as spoken responses for four minutes. To maintain a consistent response pace, participants</p><p>were asked to open a web page, with a purple dot flashing at the center of the screen, 37 beats per minute. Participants were asked to generate a number every time the dot appeared. They produced responses slightly faster than requested, producing an average sequence length of 155.71 numbers (SD = 27.82).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>An illustration of the procedure of Experiments 1 and 2. The figure with a person uttering outcomes is an example for the gain domain. C=control; G=gain; L=loss; bpm=beats per minute.</p><p>At the end of each block, participants received a questionnaire with two questions:</p><p>first, a forced-choice question, whether all the numbers were equally likely; and second, the probabilities of each number as a percentage without requiring that they sum to 100. After the questionnaire, in the gain and loss domains, the experimenter drew a slip from a bag in front of the participants. The outcome on the slip was not revealed until the end of the experiment and either added or subtracted from the point total. This total was then converted into a cash bonus, with each point equaling one penny 2 . This approach aimed to encode outcomes as either losses or gains while keeping them independent from the random generation tasks. The experiment took about 40 minutes to complete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Two participants were excluded due to generating at least one sequence that was shorter than 80% of the required length (i.e., fewer than 118 numbers). The results reported below are for the final sample of 28 participants.</p><p>When analysing and reporting the data, each generated response was converted into its absolute value, meaning "5" in the control domain, "winning 5 points" in the gain domain, and "losing 5 points" in the loss domain were all transcribed as 5 (and all termed "number" below).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Outline</head><p>The analysis was carried out in four stages. First, we examined the responses of the participants to the forced choice question of whether all numbers were equally likely, as a check on their understanding of the probability distribution. Second, we measured the similarity between the distributions of the probability judgment and the random generation tasks to explore potential alignment between these methods. In the third stage, we focused on the random generation results and conducted a group-level analysis to investigate the effects of domains and starting points on the generated numbers via a Bayesian ANOVA.</p><p>Since the analysis revealed a significant effect of the domains, we further examined their influence on the mean responses in both the random generation and probability judgment tasks.</p><p>Finally, we conducted an individual-level analysis. This began with examining the effects of domains and starting points for each participant using Bayesian ANOVA to identify subgroups of participants who were or were not influenced by the domains. To confirm the existence of a group uninfluenced by the domains, we applied the same group-level Bayesian ANOVA to their data. We then qualitatively visualised the direction of participants' biases by comparing the mean of the generated numbers in the gain and loss domains with those in the control domain. Lastly, we evaluated each participant's distribution by comparing it to the neutral distribution (the distribution of the random generation results in the control domain), and the importance distributions defined in the Utility-Weighted sampling <ref type="bibr">(UWS, Lieder, Griffiths, &amp; Hsu, 2018)</ref> model, where the Polarisation hypothesis is one of its special cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Responses to the Forced Choice Question</head><p>For the forced choice question, the majority of participants selected "equal" across the three domains: 78.57% in the control domain (22 out of 28, 95% CI = [59.05%, 91.70%]), 67.86% in the gain domain (19 out of 28, 95% CI = [47.65%, 84.12%]), and 82.14% in the loss domain (23 out of 28, 95% CI = [63.11%, 93.94%]). Detailed counts are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, we conducted a comparison of the proportion of "equal" responses in the gain and loss domains relative to the control domain. Using McNemar's test with continuity correction, we were unable to reject the null hypothesis, which states participants report the same pattern of probability based on our manipulation of gain or loss domain. Specifically, the test results were χ 2 (1, N = 28) = 1.33, p = .5 for the control-gain comparison and χ 2 (1, N = 28) = 1, p = 1 for the control-loss comparison, after a Holm-Bonferroni correction. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparing Distributions of Probability Estimates and Random Generation</head><p>In this analysis, we wanted to address whether the generated histograms align with participants' probability judgments. <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref> illustrates the distribution of (normalised) probability judgments and random generation proportions across numbers for each domain.</p><p>To obtain these two types of distributions, we normalised the probability judgments and the histogram of the random generation for each participant and calculated the mean value for each number across the participants. Comparisons with the uniform distribution via one-sample t tests, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, revealed tendencies to under-generate 0 in the loss domain, under-generate 0 and 1 in the gain domain, and over-generate 3 in the loss domain.</p><p>Furthermore, we observed high similarity between the probability judgment and random generation distributions, quantified by the overlapping index <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Pastore &amp; Calcagnì, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Weitzman, 1970)</ref> measuring the percentage of these distributions covering the same area; overlapping indices were calculated individually for each subject, and the mean coefficient for each domain is presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>.</p><p>At the individual level, we analysed the correlation of the mean values and of the variance between the random generation and probability judgment in each domain. The results, summarised in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>, include Pearson's correlation coefficients and the corresponding p-values after applying Holm-Bonferroni correction. These analyses did not indicate any significant correlations between the two tasks. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group-level Analysis of Random Generation</head><p>If utilities influence the sampling process, we would expect the means of the generated numbers to differ across the domains. Similarly, if there is a time course of biases, the initial number in each domain (the starting point) should be distinct from the subsequent numbers. To test these two hypotheses, we conducted a within-subject Bayesian ANOVA 3 with the default prior scales and calculated the inclusion Bayes factor (BF) using R packages BayesFactor (version 0.9.12-4.5; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Morey et al., 2023)</ref> and bayestestR <ref type="bibr">(version 0.13.2;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Makowski et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 3</head><p>The comparison between the normalised probability judgment and the distributions of random generation in control, gain and loss domains of Experiment 1. The dashed lines indicate the theoretical distribution, i.e., uniform distribution; the black error bars represent the 95% confidence interval; the stars mark the numbers or the outcomes whose densities are significantly different from the uniform distribution after a Holm-Bonferroni correction at the significance level of 0.05 ; the percentages are the values of the overlapping index between the probability judgment and the distribution of random generation.</p><p>Specifically, we considered the domains, the starting points (whether the number is the first one or not) and their interaction as the fixed effects in the Bayesian ANOVA. We also accounted for the random effect of the subjects. The BF were 1.27 × 10 15 , 4.92 × 10 6 and 1/2.17 for the domains, starting point and their interaction respectively. As indicated in the results of the Bayesian ANOVA, participants exhibited a starting point bias. <ref type="figure">Figure   4</ref> shows that participants typically began with a relatively small value, and all subsequent numbers were distributed more evenly.</p><p>Given the significant effect of domains observed earlier, we conducted an additional Bayesian ANOVA to examine the effects of domains and task type (random generation vs. probability judgment) on the mean responses. The BF from this Bayesian ANOVA provided anecdotal evidence against differences in the means across the domains (BF =</p></div>

Despite this, we found substantial evidence supporting an interaction effect (BF = 3.87). We believe that the low BF for the domain effect due to using means instead of raw numbers, which reduces individual variance and obscures domain influences. These results will be later discussed in the Discussion subsection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Differences in Random Generation</head><p>The BF for both the domains and the starting point variables indicated decisive evidence that these factors had significant effects. However, we wanted to further investigate how the specific domains influenced the numbers individually.</p><p>A Bayesian ANOVA was applied to each participant's data. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table A1</ref> shows the distribution of the individual BF. We found that 78.57% of the participants (22 out of 28, 95% CI = [59.05%, 91.70%]) had a BF value below 1/3. To confirm that these 22 participants were not influenced by the domains, and that this was not a consequence of a small effect size and little data being interpreted as evidence for the null <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Sanborn &amp; Hills, 2014)</ref>, we repeated the group-level Bayesian ANOVA using only their data. This time, we found that the BF of the domains dropped to 1/46.99 and the BF of the interaction was 1/81.82. However, the BF of the starting point was 8.46 × 10 5 , still indicating decisive evidence supporting the starting point bias.</p><p>In addition, to investigate and visualise the direction of participants' biases (or lack thereof), we calculated the mean values of each domain for each participant, and then subtracted the mean value of the control domain from the mean values of the gain and the loss domains. independent samples were drawn from the neutral distribution to match the average sequence length in Experiment 1. This process was repeated three times, simulating the Neutrality hypothesis by maintaining a consistent distribution across all three domains.</p><p>We then calculated the mean value difference between the simulated gain and simulated control domains, and between simulated loss and simulated control domains.</p><p>Following the central limit theorem, the joint distribution of the two types of mean value differences followed a bi-variate normal distribution, of which the mean value and the covariance matrix can be estimated from the simulation results. The 95% confidence region of this distribution is shown as an ellipse in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. We found that 82.14% of the participants (23 out of 28, 95% CI = [63.11%, 93.94%]), including all 22 participants whose individual BF of the domains were below 1/3, had points that fell within the ellipse. This indicates that more than half of the participants were unaffected by the change in domains.</p><p>Among the remaining participants, there were three in the Optimism region, one in the Polarisation region and one in the Centralisation region.</p></div>

Assuming independence among the sampled numbers, we used a multinomial likelihood function to identify the best-fitting distribution-based hypothesis for each participant across both domains.</p><p>In our analysis, we assumed the pre-weighted distribution p(o) in equation 2 to be either the uniform or the neutral distribution. We considered k = 1 and k = 0.5, covering the range of the utility exponent empirically identified in previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Glöckner &amp; Pachur, 2012)</ref>.

An estimate of σ ε = 0.1703, as determined by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lieder, Griffiths, and Hsu (2018)</ref>, was applied consistently across all the specified UWS models.</p><p>Since the utility function contains noise and the importance distribution is influenced by utilities, we ran a simulation 20,000 times to estimate the importance distribution. In each simulation, random noise was added to each outcome's utility, and the resulting importance distribution was computed. We then calculated the mean "importance probability" for each outcome across all simulation results. However, we identified one optimistic participant who was classified under the UWS model with k = 1, u = u(o), a model that does not predict an optimistic trend. This discrepancy occurred because the empirical distributions overestimated "0" in the loss domain and "5" in the gain domain, whereas the importance distribution predicted an overestimation of both "0" and "5" across domains. As a result, the importance distribution produced a higher overall likelihood than other hypotheses. These findings suggest that, for most of the participants, the utilities of the outcomes did not influence the sampling process as predicted by the UWS models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>First, we compared the histograms of responses between the probability judgment and random generation tasks. While there was considerable overlap between the two, the correlations of their means or variances were not statistically significant, and we found substantial evidence supporting an interaction between domains and tasks. These results</p></div>

This discrepancy could be attributed to the simplicity of the uniform distribution, which could allow participants to judge probabilities directly without relying on sampling. Next, we investigated the influence of utility on the random generation task. While we found an overall effect of the domains, further individual-level analysis revealed that the majority of the participants were unaffected by the utilities and drew samples from the same distribution, regardless of whether they were placed within the control, gain or loss domains. This was despite participants receiving payment based on the outcome of the random draw (though necessarily payment was not based on their responses), and prefacing each of their responses in which they imagined a win or a loss with "winning" and "losing".</p><p>Our random generation paradigm also allowed us to examine the time course of mental simulation, and we uncovered a starting point bias among participants: Individuals initially favour smaller numerical values than the subsequent numbers as they continued their sampling process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>The results of Experiment 1 supported the Neutrality hypothesis for the majority of participants when the outcomes followed a uniform distribution. However, since most real-world lotteries have unequal probabilities, Experiment 2 investigated a new scenario:</p><p>the number of heads after flipping 10 coins. This experiment aimed to investigate whether the Neutrality hypothesis and the starting point bias observed in Experiment 1 would persist under a binomial distribution. Additionally, it examined whether the generated histograms and probability judgments would align more closely as the underlying distributions increased in complexity compared to the uniform distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>A total of 40 participants (31 women, 9 men; age: M = 23.0 years, SD = 3.7) took part in this experiment. All participants were recruited via the University of Warwick participant pool (https://warwick.sona-systems.com/). They were reimbursed with Amazon vouchers (a show-up fee of £3 and a random bonus). The bonus was either £0 or £1, depending on the gambles at the end of the experiment. The average payment was £3.50. Ethical approval was given by the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee (HSSREC) at the University of Warwick.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design, Materials and Procedure</head><p>The design and procedure were identical to Experiment 1 ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>), with the following exceptions: participants were asked to have both the microphone and the camera on, and their video and voice were recorded. This was only for ensuring that participants remained fully attentive during the experiment.</p><p>The materials also changed. Participants were presented with ten coins in a transparent box. They were asked to imagine shaking the box, observing the number of heads, and responding with that number. In the winning and losing scenarios, the number of heads represented the number of points that was won or lost, while in the control scenario, the number of heads had no meaning.</p><p>The order of the domains was counterbalanced as we did in Experiment 1, and the participants were still asked to follow a flashing dot with a pace of 37 times per minute. In Experiment 2, participants produced a speed close to the theoretical one-an average length of 148.26 numbers (SD = 6.19) after 4 minutes.</p><p>At the end of each domain, participants received the same two questions from Experiment 1. In the gain and loss domains, before advancing to the next block, the experimenter shook the box in front of the participants, counted the number of heads, and converted it into points (one head equals one point) that the participants won or lost (see Footnote 2). But at the end of the control domain, the experimenter did not play this gamble. Before the experiment ended, the experimenter calculated the total points (denoted as T). Then the participants were given a T/20 chance to win a £1 bonus or otherwise only received the show-up fee. The experiment took about 40 minutes to complete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Three participants were excluded due to generating at least one sequence that was shorter than 80% of the required length (i.e., fewer than 118 numbers); one participant was excluded due to having more than three values outside of the range of 0 and 10. The results reported below are for the final sample of 36 participants. Since Experiment 2 measured the same variables as Experiment 1, the analysis outline remained identical.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Responses to the Forced Choice Question</head><p>As in Experiment 1, we initially examined participants' responses to the forced-choice question asking whether all outcomes are equally likely.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 3</ref> provides more detailed counts.</p><p>Furthermore, we conducted a comparison of the proportion of "unequal" responses in the gain and loss domains relative to the control domain. Using McNemar's test with continuity correction, we are still unable to reject the null hypothesis, which states that participants report the same pattern of probability based on our manipulation of gain or loss domain. Specifically, the test results were χ 2 (1, N = 36) = 0, p = 1.0 for the control-gain comparison and χ 2 (1, N = 36) = 0, p = 1.0 for the control-loss comparison, after a Holm-Bonferroni correction.  <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> depicts the probability judgment and the distribution of random generation for each domain compared with the binomial distribution using one-sample t tests. The stars mark the numbers whose densities are significantly different from the binomial distribution at the significance level of 0.05 after a Holm-Bonferroni correction. Notably, both the probability judgments and the distributions of random generation exhibited a significant departure from the expected binomial distribution, reflecting a "flattened" shape consistent with prior research showing that participants produce sampling distributions that are flatter than the true probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Peterson et al., 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Teigen, 1974)</ref>.</p><p>The overlapping index was also employed to examine the similarity between these two distributions: Their values were all equal to or higher than 75%, indicating a high level of similarity between the explicit probability judgments and random generation relative frequencies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 7</head><p>The comparison between the normalised probability judgment and the distributions of random generation in control, gain and loss domains of Experiment 2. The dashed lines indicate the theoretical distribution, i.e., binomial distribution; the black error bars represent the 95% confidence interval; the stars mark the numbers whose densities are significantly different from the binomial distribution after a Holm-Bonferroni correction at the significance level of 0.05; the percentages are the values of the overlapping index between the probability judgment and the distribution of random generation.</p><p>At the individual level, we analysed the correlation of the mean values and of the variance between the random generation and probability judgment, shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Table 4</ref>. We found that the correlations of the mean values were significant in all three domains, and the correlation of the variance was also significant in the loss domain, meaning participants' random generations and probability judgments are strongly related.</p><p>The consistency between these tasks indicates that individuals likely rely on mental simulations when making explicit probability estimates. This alignment reinforces the idea that random generation can provide valuable insights into how people intuitively evaluate probabilities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group-level Analysis of Random Generation</head><p>A within-subjects Bayesian ANOVA was employed to examine whether there were effects of domain and starting point in the generated numbers. The method and the variables were all the same as in Experiment 1.</p><p>The BF of the domains was 1.32 × 10 11 , indicating decisive evidence for the fixed effects. In contrast, the BF of the starting points was only 1/1.09, indicating anecdotal evidence at best against a fixed effect. Additionally, the BF of 1/3.28 for the interaction indicated that the data provided substantial evidence against an interaction effect between these factors.</p><p>We propose that the absence of the starting point bias observed in previous experiments is due to participants' tendency to begin with the most probable outcome when the distribution is non-uniform. The binomial distribution, in particular, is a special case where the most probable outcome coincides with the mean value. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> illustrates the histograms of the starting points compared to all subsequent numbers. Examining the</p></div>

Post hoc tests for each domain showed that the number 5 had a significantly higher proportion at the starting points than among the subsequent numbers in the gain domain (χ 2 (1) = 7.26, p = .01; BF = 6.50). However, no significant differences were found in the control domain (χ 2 (1) = 1.09, p = .15; BF = 1/2.72) or the loss domain (χ 2 (1) = 3.02, p = .08; BF = 1/1.01). All the post hoc p-values were Holm-Bonferroni corrected.</p><p>We also investigated the influence of the domains on the mean responses in both the random generation and probability judgment tasks. Similar to the results in Experiment 1, the BF from the Bayesian ANOVA provided anecdotal evidence against differences in the means across the domains (BF = 1/1.45) or between the tasks (BF = 1/2.97). And in contrast to the results of Experiment 1, we found substantial evidence against an interaction effect (BF = 1/13.70), further supporting the idea of consistency between these tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Differences in Random Generation</head><p>We next explored the individual differences in the effect of the domains. We repeated the same Bayesian ANOVA for each individual as we did in Experiment 1, and To visualise the influence of the utilities, we employed the same Monte Carlo method as in Experiment 1 with the exception that 146 independent samples were drawn from the distributions to match the average sequence length in Experiment 2.</p><p>The results, illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 9</ref>, reveal that 72.22% of the participants (26 out of 36, 95% CI = [54.81%, 85.80%]) fell within the ellipse, while five participants were in the Centralisation region, two in the Polarisation region, and three in the Optimism region.</p><p>We also noticed that one participant with a BF of the domains below 1/3 fell outside the confidence ellipse. This anomaly occurred because the participant's personal neutral distribution deviated from the neutral distribution used to estimate the confidence ellipse. Despite this deviation, the participant remained unaffected by the domain conditions, aligning with the Neutrality hypothesis.</p><p>We used the same distribution-based likelihood comparison to assess how well the Neutrality hypothesis and the UWS models fit the empirical distributions. The same simulation method was used to calculate the importance distributions except that the pre-weighted distribution p(o) was the binomial distribution in Experiment 2. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 10</ref> presents the overlap between the empirical distributions and their best-fitted hypothetical distributions ( <ref type="figure">Figure B2</ref> displays the same figure but assuming that the pre-weighted  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Comparing the histograms of responses between the probability judgment and random generation tasks, we observed high overlapping indices as well as a significant positive correlation in their mean values. We also found substantial evidence against the interaction between domains and tasks. These findings suggest that when the distribution becomes more complex, participants are more likely to rely on the sampling process to inform their probability judgments.</p><p>Even when using outcomes with unequal probabilities, our results continue to demonstrate that for most individuals the domains do not exert a significant influence on sampling patterns. Probabilities did influence the sampling proportions, with the higher probability head counts being more often randomly generated. Moreover, our observations align with prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Peterson et al., 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Teigen, 1974)</ref>, reflecting a flattened sampling distribution. These findings bolster the Neutrality hypothesis, depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure  1</ref>, which suggests that people's sampling tendencies are primarily influenced by objective probabilities, unaffected by domain variations.</p><p>It is important to note that we did not observe the starting point bias identified in the previous experiment, where participants tended to begin with smaller numbers.</p><p>Instead, Experiment 2 revealed a different form of starting point bias: when the risky event followed a non-uniform distribution, participants were more likely to start sampling from the most probable outcome, with the strongest evidence for this in the gain domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3</head><p>Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated how considering individual difference is important as it showed that the majority of participants supported the Neutrality hypothesis under the random generation paradigm. In contrast, prior research using a similar approach, the Marks paradigm, found evidence in favour of the Optimism hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Irwin, 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Marks, 1951)</ref>. Such a difference raises the question of whether the Optimism observed in the Marks paradigm masks a predominance of Neutrality participants, or whether people are more optimistic in the Marks paradigm due to the fundamental methodological differences. This was addressed in Experiment 3.</p><p>First, we compared random generation with the Marks paradigm by using the same card-drawing scenario as the Marks paradigm. The key difference was in the instructions:</p><p>participants were asked to imagine drawing a card in the random generation task and to predict which card would be drawn in the Marks paradigm. outcomes. The support for the Neutrality hypothesis could have been influenced by this factor, as fewer and more distinctive outcomes might lead to bias. To investigate this, Experiment 3 compared gambles with two outcomes to those with six outcomes.</p><p>In summary, Experiment 3 built on the domain manipulations in Experiments 1 and 2 while introducing three additional independent variables for comparison with the Marks paradigm: task instruction (random generation or prediction), repetition (one-off task or a task repeated 10 times), and number of outcomes (two or six). The primary objectives of Experiment 3 were to investigate:</p><p>1. Whether participants' responses would be influenced by the gain, loss, and control domains; 2. Whether different task instructions (random generation vs. prediction) would affect participants' responses;</p><p>3. Whether responses in the one-off task would be different from the overall responses in the repeated task;</p><p>4. Whether participants were more likely to show the influence of domains with fewer outcomes;</p><p>5. Whether the numbers generated in the one-off condition were similar to the starting points in the repeated condition; and 6. Whether the starting point bias observed in Experiment 1 would replicate. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design, Materials and Procedure</head><p>Experiment 3 employed a within-subject design with 24 different conditions (3 domains × 2 tasks × 2 levels of repetition × 2 levels of number of outcomes). To maintain task consistency, participants either began with prediction tasks followed by random generation tasks or started with random generation tasks followed by prediction tasks.</p><p>Within each task, a Latin square design was used to balance the order of the 12 conditions (3 domains × 2 levels of repetition × 2 levels of number of outcomes). This approach created 24 possible condition orders, and we ensured that the number of participants assigned to each order was as balanced as possible, with the difference in sample size across orders kept to no more than one.</p><p>Participants were shown a figure of six cards. In the two-outcome condition, three cards were labeled "0" and three were labeled "5" in the control domain; three were labeled "+0" and three "+5" in the gain domain; and three were labeled "−0" and three "−5" in the loss domain. In the six-outcome condition, the cards were labeled with numbers ranging from "0" to "5" in the control domain, "+0" to "+5" in the gain domain, and "−0"</p><p>to "−5" in the loss domain.</p><p>The experimental program was developed using PsychoPy3 (version 2023.2.3; Peirce et al., 2019) and conducted online. <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> illustrates the procedure for a condition in Experiment 3. At the start of each condition, participants were introduced to the gamble,</p><p>where the cards would be shuffled, and a random card drawn with replacement. In the random generation task, participants were instructed to imagine drawing a card, while in the prediction task, participants were asked to predict the value on a randomly drawn card.</p><p>The full text of the instructions for each condition is included in Appendix C.</p><p>After the instruction screen, participants had 30 seconds to enter their imagined or predicted value in a text box and click the "Next" button to continue. To ensure participants maintained awareness of the domain, they had to include the symbols "+" and "−" with each input in the gain and loss domains to proceed. If no input was provided within 30 seconds, the program advanced automatically. Once participants submitted their responses, the program executed the gamble, displayed an animation of shuffling and drawing cards, and saved the results without revealing them to the participants. Both tasks ended with a comprehension check question: "Which task have you been asked to do?" with two options provided: "imagine drawing cards" and "predict cards to be drawn".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 11</head><p>The procedure of a condition for Experiment 3.</p><p>As in Experiments 1 and 2, the values in the gain and loss domains represented winning and losing points, respectively.

The experiment lasted approximately 30 minutes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Three criteria were used for data exclusion, and participants meeting any of these were excluded: First, participants with more than 13 invalid inputs (10% out of the 132 inputs in total) across the experiment 4 were excluded (n = 3); Second, participants who failed both comprehension checks regarding the task instructions were excluded (n = 4);</p><p>Third, we excluded participants whose random sequences were extremely predictable in any of the four repeated-control conditions (prediction vs. random generation and two-vs. six-outcome; n = 52) 5 . We established this by using a measure from chaos theory, "determinism" (DET), which measures how much of a given sequence is repeated elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Marwan et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Weber and Camerer, 1987</ref>; see Appendix D), and which has previously been used as an exclusion criterion in random generation studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Castillo et al., 2024)</ref>. To avoid domain effects, we applied this measure only to sequences in the control condition, setting the exclusion threshold to 90%. In total, data from 56 participants were excluded. The results reported below are for the final sample of 98 participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Outline</head><p>The analysis was conducted at both the group and individual levels. At the group level, we examined the distribution of the response numbers in two ways. First, we compared the averaged histograms of the response numbers in the two-and six-outcome conditions with the theoretical uniform distribution. Second, we compared the mean values of each of the 24 conditions with the theoretical mean of 2.5. To address Objectives 1-4 from the introduction of Experiment 3 and investigate the effects of the independent variables-task instruction, number of outcomes, number of repetitions, and domains-as well as their interactions, we performed a Bayesian ANOVA. For Question 5, we compared the response numbers in the one-off condition with the starting points in the repeated condition. To answer Question 6, we compared the starting point with all the subsequent numbers within the repeated condition. Both of these analyses were carried out using Bayesian ANOVA.</p><p>In the individual-level analysis, we focused on the independent variables that showed significant effects in the group-level analysis, analysing their influence at the individual level using Bayesian ANOVAs. Since the two-outcome and six-outcome gambles differ in their outcome variances, the numbers generated in these two conditions could also exhibit different variances, potentially affecting the ANOVA results. To address this, we divided the data into two subsets based on the number of outcomes and conducted </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group-level Analysis</head><p>Firstly, we illustrated how the numbers were distributed in the two-and six-outcome conditions, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual-level Analysis</head><p>An individual-level analysis was carried out to evaluate whether the "significant" BF in <ref type="table" target="#tab_10">Table 5</ref> was representative of all participants. We repeated the individual Bayesian ANOVA and BF as in the above experiments, but considered the variables of the domains, repetition, and their interaction. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>90.37%]).</head><p>Then, we separated the data into two subsets based on the number of outcomes to evaluate the consistency of the domain effect. Specifically, for each participant and each level of the number of outcomes, we analysed the influence of the domains using the Bayesian ANOVA and the BF. The BF for the two-and six-outcome conditions were found to be significantly and positively correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient after Box-Cox transformation: r(96) = .54, p &lt; .001). To avoid the correlation being artificially caused by individual points falling in the corner, participants were categorised based on their individual BFs, using a comparison threshold of 1/3. The contingency table for this categorisation is presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 8</ref>. The results of the Fisher's exact test also indicated a significant correlation (p &lt; .001). As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_14">Table 8</ref>, there were 63.26% of the participants (62 out of 98; 95% CI = [52.93%, 72.78%]) with BFs lower than 1/3 at both the two-and six-outcome conditions.</p><p>To confirm this group of participants were not influenced by the domains, we duplicated all the group-level analyses on only these 62 participants.</p><p>Full results are provided in Appendix E. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table E1</ref> shows that the BF of the domains decreased from 1.65 × 10 27 to 1/19.48; the BF of the repetition decreased from 251.44 to 1/40.16; and the BF of their interaction decreased from 1.36 × 10 3 to 1/21.71.</p><p>These results suggest that we have identified a group of participants who were not influenced by any of these variables. However, we replicated the difference between the number in the one-off condition and the first number in the repeated condition, as observed in the group-level analysis <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table E2</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure E1</ref>). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 16</ref> visualises the individual biases. We employed the same Monte Carlo method to estimate the 95% confidence ellipse, except that the neutral distributions for the two-and six-outcome conditions are the empirical histograms of the numbers in the control domain in Experiment 3, and 22 independent samples were drawn for each iteration of the simulation. We found that 86.73% of the participants (85 out of 98, 95% CI = [78.38%, 92.74%]) had points that fell within the ellipses of the Neutrality hypothesis at each level of the numbers of outcomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 16</head><p>The We next moved on to the distribution-based likelihood comparison that involves both the two-and six-outcome conditions. The same simulation method was used to calculate the importance distributions of the UWS models except that the pre-weighted distribution p(o) was the two-and six-outcomes uniform distributions, respectively. For each participant, the likelihood of each hypothesis was evaluated and summed across the four empirical distributions (gain vs. loss and two vs. six outcomes). As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure   17</ref> ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure B3 displays the same figure but assuming</ref>  in Experiment 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In Experiment 3, we varied the task instruction, the number of outcomes, the repetition of the tasks, and the domains. At the group level, we found that people were not influenced by the the task instruction but were influenced by the number of repetitions and the domains. Our analysis also revealed that people tended to produce higher values in the one-off conditions than their first number in the repeated condition. Within the repeated condition, a starting point bias was observed, which was utility-dependent: Participants tended to start with a high value in the gain domain and a low value in both the control and loss domains.</p><p>Further individual-level analysis showed that some effects were driven by a minority of participants, while others were not. Notably, more than half of the participants were not influenced by repetition, domains, or their interactions, and the effect (or non-effect) of domains was consistent across different levels of the number of outcomes. When we focused on participants who were not influenced by domains at both number-of-outcome conditions, we replicated only one effect observed in the group-level analysis: participants were more extreme in the one-off condition than in the first item of the repeated condition.</p></div>

The lines represent the empirical distributions of each participant, and the bar plots show the distributions of each hypothesis.

Approximately 84% (82/98) of the participants were best fitted by the Neutrality hypothesis, suggesting that their sampling process was not influenced by changes in the domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 4</head><p>A potential issue for the previous experiments was that participants received only minimal or no monetary incentives from the gambles. Since we wanted to investigate whether the utility of an outcome biases participants' perception of its associated probability, it is possible that the previous support for the Neutrality hypothesis was due to the low magnitude of the incentives. With smaller incentives, participants might not have been sufficiently motivated for their perceptions to reflect any bias.</p><p>Second, participants in similar prediction tasks are often incentivised based on their accuracy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Budescu &amp; Bruderman, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Crandall et al., 1955)</ref> or receive feedback, such as being shown the actual results after making their predictions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Park et al., 2022)</ref>. In our study, however, the bonus had to remain independent of participants' responses. To address this, we provided feedback on their accuracy after each condition, a feature not included in Experiment 3. This adjustment aimed to make the task more comparable to other prediction tasks in the literature.</p><p>With Experiment 4, we explored whether the results found in Experiment 3 are robust after we increase the magnitude of the incentive and the distinction between the random generation and the prediction tasks. The design, hypotheses, and analysis method of the study were pre-registered on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/sbeq9).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 48 participants (25 women, 23 men; age: M =24.8 years, SD=3.0) via the University of Warwick subject pool (https://warwick.sona-systems.com/). For the half-an-hour experiment, they received a substantial payment involving a show-up fee of £5 plus a random bonus ranging between £0 and £20. The average payment was £15.</p><p>Ethical approval was given by the Humanities and Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee (HSSREC) at the University of Warwick.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design, Materials and Procedure</head><p>The experiment was the same as Experiment 3, with a few exceptions. The 24 condition orders were counterbalanced, with two participants assigned to each order. This experiment was conducted in person, with participants using laboratory computers via the Pavlovia platform (https://pavlovia.org/). Additionally, card values now represented monetary values rather than points, indicated by adding a pound sign (£) in front of the numbers for the gain and loss domain. This change aimed to make the concept of utility more concrete and to allow incentivization with larger monetary incentives compared to Experiments 1 and 2.</p><p>Similar to Experiment 3, the program played the gambles after each condition and saved the results. At the end of the experiment, one result from each type of gamble (gains vs. loss and two vs. six outcomes) was randomly selected and summed to determine the bonus. Since all outcomes were based on chance, the actual bonus depended on the randomly selected results. As we used the same gambles in Experiment 3, the worst possible result was losing £10. The participants were initially given a cash note of £10, which was put in front of them throughout the experiment and could gain or lose from depending on the results of the gambles.</p><p>The experimental program was also modified in a few ways. In the prediction task, participants received feedback on their accuracy and the theoretical accuracy after each condition, whereas no feedback was provided in the random generation task. The second change involved adding a comprehension check after presenting the information sheet. This check asked whether the bonus amount depended on participants' responses or was unrelated: Participants who answered incorrectly had to reread the information sheet and attempt the question again. Notably, performance on this comprehension check was not part of the exclusion criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>As we preregistered, we excluded participants who had more than 13 invalid inputs (n = 1) or failed both comprehension checks (n = 3). We found 31 participants with a DET measure higher than 90%. However, excluding these participants would have removed the majority of the sample, leaving insufficient data for meaningful analysis. To address this, we deviated from the preregistered criterion, retaining a final sample of 44 participants. For transparency, we report analyses using the originally planned exclusion criteria (resulting in a sample size of 15 participants) in Appendix F. These results are largely consistent with those obtained using the sample of 44 participants. Since Experiment 4 measured the same variables as Experiment 3, the analysis outline remained identical and followed the pre-registered analysis plan 6 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group-level Analysis</head><p>First we compared the averaged histogram of the numbers in each domain and each level of the number of outcomes with the theoretical uniform distributions. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 18</ref>, we observed the same optimistic pattern that we found in Experiment 3. In terms of mean values in each of the 24 conditions, we compared them with 2.5 using one-sample t tests and marked the ones significantly different from 2.5 at the level of 0.05 after a Holm-Bonferroni correction. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 19</ref>, all mean values in the gain domain were higher than 2.5, while those in the loss domain were lower, also reflecting an optimistic bias in participants' responses.</p><p>A Bayesian ANOVA was used to analyse the influence of the independent variables and their interactions, and <ref type="table" target="#tab_17">Table 9</ref> presents the corresponding BFs.

However, we attribute this finding to the small sample size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>In this article, we investigated the impact of the utility of outcomes on mental simulations in various gambles with descriptive probabilities. According to our results, the group-level analysis across all four experiments indicated an influence of utility. However, individual-level analyses revealed notable differences. In the first three experiments, the majority of participants produced mental simulations that were unbiased by utilities, aligning with the Neutrality hypothesis. In contrast, Experiment 4 showed a shift: fewer than half of the participants remained unbiased, while most of the biased participants exhibited an Optimism bias. We attribute this difference to the engagement of the participants. Experiment 4 was conducted in person and involved participants holding an endowment during the task. This setup made the rewards more tangible and salient compared to Experiments 1-3. As a result, participants exhibited more optimistic behaviour in response to the task.</p><p>Quantitatively, we compared the Neutrality hypothesis with four different versions of the importance distributions defined in the UWS models, two of which provide a quantitative description of the Polarisation hypothesis. Our finding revealed that the Neutrality hypothesis emerged as the winning model across all experiments-although it was not as dominant in Experiment 4 as it had been in the first three experiments.</p><p>However, we also observed that some optimistic individuals were classified under the U-shaped importance distribution in Experiments 1, 3, and 4. This classification occurred because the distribution failed to account for the asymmetry in overestimation between the gain and loss domains, highlighting the requirement of the quantitative distributions for other hypotheses.</p><p>The analysis of starting point biases and their interaction with domains revealed variability across experiments. For uniformly distributed risky events (Experiments 1, 3, and 4), we found decisive evidence of a starting point effect on the values, aligning with empirical findings on the anchoring effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Lieder, Griffiths, M. Huys, &amp; Goodman, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Regarding the interaction with domains, Experiment 3 provided strong evidence for an interaction, while Experiments 1 and 4 showed anecdotal or substantial evidence against such an effect. However, further analysis of Experiment 3, focusing exclusively on participants who were uninfluenced by the domains, revealed only anecdotal evidence supporting a utility-dependent starting point bias (the BF of domain × starting points is 1.64 in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table E3</ref>). In summary, when outcomes are equally likely, utility-sensitive participants tend to start with an optimistic value, while utility-insensitive participants tend to start with smaller values.</p><p>In contrast, for non-uniform distributions (Experiment 2), there was no evidence of a starting point effect on the values. Instead, participants tended to start sampling from the most probable outcome in the gain domain, with no significant effects observed in the control or loss domains. These findings suggest that while the starting point bias is robust across many contexts, its interaction with domain-specific factors is less consistent and requires further exploration.</p><p>In Experiments 3 and 4, we compared the starting points in the repeated condition with the numbers provided in the one-off condition. In both experiments, participants exhibited a utility-independent tendency to respond with more extreme numbers in the one-off condition compared to the starting points of the repeated condition. These findings indicate that the response in the one-off condition should not be treated as equivalent to the starting point of a sequence. This unexpected effect shows similarity to the observations by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Li (2003)</ref> in a study on risky choices, where participants were more likely to use a heuristic of comparing extreme outcomes in the one-off condition but shifted towards maximising expected value in the repeated condition. We propose that participants in our experiments also adopted different strategies depending on the context:</p><p>Participants might rely on heuristics or intuition in the one-off condition, whereas in the repeated condition, they may anticipate the need to balance predictions over time, leading</p><p>to a more rational approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Random Generation, Probability Judgment and Prediction Are Related</head><p>We compared the results of probability judgment and random generation tasks in Experiments 1 and 2, as well as the results of prediction and random generation tasks in Experiments 3 and 4. These comparisons reveal important relationships among these tasks, providing insight into how individuals use mental simulations to approximate probabilities.</p><p>First, the findings from Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that people rely on mental simulation when making probability judgments, particularly in more complex scenarios, such as those involving binomial distributions (Experiment 2). In simpler contexts, participants may bypass simulation and instead estimate probabilities directly using descriptive statistics or common knowledge. Second, the results of Experiments 3 and 4</p><p>indicate that the prediction tasks produced outcomes similar to the random generation tasks, especially in the absence of accuracy feedback. This convergence between the two tasks supports the notion that predictions are also guided by a mental simulation process.</p><p>These findings highlight a fundamental cognitive mechanism underlying all three tasks: the use of mental simulation to estimate probabilities across distributions (as in probability judgment), and commit to forecasts (as in prediction). Together, these results suggest that probability judgment and prediction tasks tap into a shared cognitive process, providing converging evidence for the simulation heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1982</ref>) as a key process for navigating risk and uncertainty.</p><p>This idea offers a potential explanation for some of the findings in prediction and probability judgments, particularly related to the desirability bias (referred to as the Optimism hypothesis in our study). For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Park et al. (2022)</ref> reported that predictions show a much stronger desirability bias, which they attributed to the influence of non-normative factors, such as hunches. We propose an alternative explanation: The prediction may be based on fewer samples than the likelihood judgments (as also suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sundh et al., 2023)</ref>, leading to a stronger Optimism effect observed in predictions compared to likelihood judgments.</p><p>In addition, as reviewed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Krizan and Windschitl (2007)</ref>, the effect of the desirability bias is strongest when the two outcomes of a gamble have equal probabilities (50/50), but is weaker when the probabilities are unequal. Although our study did not explicitly test the interaction between probability and utility in the one-off condition, the influence of probabilities on the repeated mental simulations that we found in Experiment 2 suggests that participants prioritised probability over utility. We speculate that this tendency extends to the one-off condition, reflecting a cognitive heuristic that favours probability more than utility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Differences Should be Considered</head><p>Our study highlights the importance of considering individual differences in psychological research. Across the four experiments, the BF of the domains at the group level consistently provided decisive evidence supporting the effect of the domains. However, further individual-level analysis revealed that this effect in Experiments 1, 2, and 3 was driven by a small subset of participants, while the majority of participants remained uninfluenced by the domain manipulations. These findings demonstrate that group-level results can mask meaningful variability at the individual level.</p><p>As <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Frankot et al. (2024)</ref> noted, group-level analyses often obscure the presence of subgroups and individual patterns of behaviour. Our findings align with this view, underscoring the limitations of relying solely on aggregate data to draw conclusions. Even sophisticated statistical approaches, such as the mixed-effects models used in our group-level analysis, may fail to fully account for the diversity of individual responses. This is particularly important in tasks involving risk and probability, where individual cognitive process can vary widely based on factors such as the use of cognitive heuristics (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Shaham et al., 1992)</ref>, cognitive abilities (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Peters et al., 2006)</ref> or personality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Huang et al., 2024)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical and Practical Implications</head><p>Our findings have theoretical implications for sampling-based models of probability judgment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Zhu et al., 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Zhu et al., , 2024</ref>, which assume people generate samples from an internal distribution of possible outcomes. Furthermore, they align with models of risky choice (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Busemeyer &amp; Diederich, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lieder, Griffiths, &amp; Hsu, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Roe et al., 2001)</ref>, which describe decision-making as a process of comparing outcomes weighted by their probabilities. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating individual differences into these models, particularly regarding two possible tendencies: while some individuals may remain unaffected by outcome utilities, adhering strictly to probability-driven sampling, others exhibit an optimistic bias, over-representing favorable outcomes. Accounting for these tendencies in theoretical frameworks could improve predictions of real-world decision-making and reveal the cognitive and motivational factors underlying variability in probabilistic reasoning.</p><p>The current findings also have practical implications for fostering rationality in probability judgment. Our observation of the starting point bias reveals that individuals often begin simulations with a skewed initial estimate. However, given sufficient time to simulate outcomes, participants tend to converge toward the rational mean value. This suggests that judgment strategies could be improved by interventions that encourage extended deliberation or structured simulation exercises, particularly in contexts where quick judgments may lead to systematic biases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, utility's influence reveals important heterogeneity in mental simulation processes. While group-level analysis provided decisive evidence supporting the effect of the domains in gain, loss and control conditions, individual-level analysis revealed a non-negligible subgroup of participants who remained uninfluenced by the domains.</p><p>Furthermore, we observed that as incentives increased, a greater proportion of participants exhibited the influence of the domains. Additionally, a starting point bias was evident, with participants favouring smaller or more probable outcomes as the initial responses.</p><p>Based on these findings, we recommend that both empirical studies and theoretical models in this field account for starting point bias and individual differences in the influence of utility on simulation processes, particularly in relation to the Neutrality (remaining unbiased) and Optimism hypotheses (over-sampling the better gains and under-sampling the worse losses in a gamble).</p></div>

However, our individual-level analyses provide a useful framework for exploring these individual differences across diverse educational backgrounds and cultures.</p><p>Furthermore, our study focused exclusively on how participants simulate gambles based on descriptive information. Since prior research has shown that people behave differently when making decisions from description versus experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hertwig &amp; Erev, 2009)</ref>, it is reasonable to infer that simulation processes may also differ when based on experiential information. Several studies have explored how utility influences experience or memory. For example, the extreme gains and losses are often overestimated during the memory encoding process <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Madan et al., 2021)</ref>, though these studies did not examine the time course of these effects. On the other hand, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Szollosi et al. (2023)</ref> asked participants to generate sequences of outcomes a gamble might provide if the experiment continued.</p><p>However, they did not evaluate the probabilities of different outcomes within those sequences. Applying the random generation paradigm to gambles based on experience could therefore provide valuable insights into the interaction between memory and utility over time.</p></div>

As a result, each participant had two BFs for domain effects: one for the two-outcome condition and one for the six-outcome condition. If the influence of domains is consistent across conditions, these two BFs should be correlated. To test this, we calculated their Pearson correlation. In addition, we used a threshold of 1/3 as the criterion and created a contingency table categorising participants</figDesc><table /><note>as influenced or not influenced by the domains for both the two-outcome and six-outcome gambles. A Fisher's exact test was then conducted to evaluate the consistency of domain influence across the two gambles. To confirm that we had identified a subgroup of participants who remained uninfluenced in both gambles, we applied a group-level Bayesian ANOVA to their data, considering all variables. To qualitatively and quantitatively assess the biases of each participant, we used the same methods as in Experiments 1 and 2. This involved comparing the mean values across the gain, loss, and control domains and evaluating individual distributions under the Neutrality and Polarisation hypotheses.</note></figure>

As specified in Equation 2, the importance distribution depends on the definition of p(o). To evaluate the robustness of this comparison, we re-analysed the data by assuming p(o) to be the neutral distribution in each experiment, while keeping all other parameters of the UWS models consistent with the previous comparisons.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figures B1, B2</ref>, B3, and B4, respectively, the Neutrality hypothesis remained the dominant hypothesis in Experiments 1, 2, and 3, while in Experiment 4, the Neutrality hypothesis was supported by only half of the participants.
