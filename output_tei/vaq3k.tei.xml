				<p>Threatening situations can evoke anger and fear. Besides hedonic motivations, anger and fear can also be modulated by instrumental factors, potentially environmental affordances. In this pre-registered study, we use a novel behavioral paradigm simulating threats via the presentation of horror movies. With this paradigm, we show that affordances in the form of items available in an agent&apos;s environment, influence both behaviour and emotion expression, in particular: 1. Whether an approach or avoidance choice is made, and 2. Levels of expressed anger and fear. Importantly, we demonstrate the causal relations between environmental affordances and the expression of anger and fear, such that more anger is expressed when resources favoring approach are available, and participants choose to fight. This offers pioneering evidence that the nature of environmental affordances shapes people&apos;s behavioral and subjective threat responses. This also supports a broader theoretical framework where instrumental motives of emotional/behavioral regulation are expressed through their changes with affordances. Significance Statement Our study unveils a pivotal relationship between environmental affordances and threat responses by leveraging a unique experimental paradigm involving horror films to simulate threat scenarios. Our findings reveal features that items available in the environment (environmental affordances) influence both behaviors (approach or avoidance) as well as levels of experienced anger and fear. Critically, we demonstrate that increased anger is expressed when resources favor an approach strategy, and individuals opt to confront the threat. This evidence emphasizes the instrumental role of environmental affordances in modulating people&apos;s affective responses to threats and furthers our understanding of emotional and behavioral regulation in response to perceived threats.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Fear and anger are subjective experiences evoked in response to threat. However, it remains unclear whether in any given threat situation, fear or anger will be predominantly experienced. Here we use a novel experimental approach to demonstrate how environmental affordances causally and differentially impact anger and fear levels.</p><p>Humans, like other animals, deploy various responses when they encounter threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mobbs, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mobbs et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mobbs &amp; LeDoux, 2018)</ref>. Emotions are programmes that coordinate sets of responses including a cognitive (e.g., attention bias) and physiological (e.g., vasoconstriction) changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1990)</ref>. Subjective affective experiences, often referred to as feelings <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Stringaris, 2015)</ref>, are one such response to threat. Fear and anger are prototypical feelings evoked by threats and associated with fight or flight reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ohman, 2007)</ref>, i.e., the set of responses necessary to either escape or combat threats. Highlighting their public health importance, intense feelings of anger and fear also define a host of very common mental disorders <ref type="bibr">(DSM-V, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>We have a limited understanding of factors determining why we experience either fear or anger in any given threat situation. Typically, factors are identified through studies on interindividual differences-the extent to which differences in trait anger or fear relate to people's respose to a threatening situation. This approach has yielded important results about how people's life histories <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Widom, 1989)</ref>, cognitive biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dodge, 1991)</ref> and affective traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dollard et al., 1939;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Vitaro et al., 2006)</ref> influence how they respond to threats. Yet inter-individual difference alone does not encompass all of factors shaping emotional responses.</p><p>Identifying factors that influence our response to threats has several important implications. First, understanding the interplay between aspects of the environment and feelings can help situate subjective affective experience in contemporary emotion theory. Indeed, many theories emphasise the role of subjective experience in emotional responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nettle &amp; Bateson, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1990)</ref>. Second, understanding the effects of the environment on emotional experience can clarify how psychopathology is maintained and expressed. Environments may amplify feelings of fear or anger ito dysfunctional traits. Modifying such environments or their perception could therefore prove helpful therapeutically.</p><p>We study environments under the term Affordance, which refers to resources offered by environment to an organism <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gibson, 1979)</ref>. Consideration of environmental affordances primarily derives from perception psychology; yet the term also applies to the context of threat. Objects in the environment can offer different affordances with different utilities. We predict that the same stimulus appearing with different affordances invokes different feelings in people. Specifically, we predict that people faced with threat experience disproportinate levels of anger when means in the environment support fighting but disproportionate levels of fear when means in the environment support escape.</p><p>We base predictions about environmental affordances on considerations about the instrumentality of emotional experience. Some approaches to emotion emphasize hedonic emotion regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gross, 2002)</ref>. In contrast, instrumental emotion regulation offers an empirical and theoretical grounding for our predictions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Tamir, 2016)</ref>. The central tenet of instrumental emotion regulation is that people's experience with emotions not only reflects hedonic (pleasure-related) value, but also the utility of an emotion, the perceived advantage it provides. There is indeed evidence that prior to engaging in conflict, people are more likely to choose situations that are likely to elicit anger rather than neutral emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tamir, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>To test these predictions, we developed a novel experimental framework in which each threat stimulus is presented multiple times with different affordances. This isolates causal effects of affordances on subjective affective experience. In our experiments, we manipulated both the resources available to fight (fight affordances) and the means of escape (escape affordances). We label fight affordances in which a weapon or weapon-like tool are available as the "weapon condition", as opposed to the "non-weapon condition", where an available tool is not suitable for fighting. Escape affordances in which escape is more difficult are referred to as the "nonevadable condition" as opposed to the "evadable condition". Feelings elicited by clips from horror movies were used as the stimulus, while participants were asked to rate their emotional responses and decisions under the movie scenarios.</p><p>We used two steps to support the spirit of open science and to ensure replicability. We first conducted a pilot study and used its results to specify our hypotheses and estimate effect sizes for the purposes of power calculations, which we pre-registered. In the second step, we collected data on n = ~250 individuals to test these hypotheses using both a frequentist and a Bayesian approach. We find that environmental affordances in the form of items available to fight or to escape when under threat, strongly influence both decisions to fight or to escape and emotions expressed under threat. Participants experience more anger in threatening situations while choosing to fight during fight affordances; they also experience more fear while choosing to escape under escape affordances. In other words, we demonstrate that anger expression is heightened with the alignment between environmental affordances and the actions chosen by the individual, such that one displays more anger when choosing to fight under the weapon condition, compared to the non-weapon condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>The study population consisted of ordinary, non-selected adults aged 18 years or older. Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and were eligible to participate if they met the following criteria: (1) currently residing in the United States, (2) having an average HIT (Human Intelligence Task) approval rate of 95% or higher, and (3) having completed a minimum of 100 HITs.</p><p>We first conducted 2 plot studies, one of them with only the fight affordances, and the other with both fight affordances and escape affordances. Due to technical difficulties, we were not able to save the full data from the pilot studies, and thus decided not to include them in the formal analysis. Confirming our initial hypothesis, we used design from the pilot study to conduct a power analysis.</p><p>We aimed to recruit a total of 250 participants to ensure adequate statistical power for the analyses. Power analysis was conducted for both the frequentist and Bayesian analysis, and a sample size of 250 was selected for both standards to reach adequate power. Data collection was conducted using the Pavlovia.org platform. Participants first completed a brief demographic questionnaire and were then provided with detailed instructions for the main experimental task. Upon completion of the task, participants were debriefed about the study's objectives and their MTurk Worker ID was collected for compensation purposes.</p><p>Participants: A total of 250 participants were recruited for the study (51.08% male, 48.05% female, 0.87% non-binary) with an age range of 26 to 75 years (M = 43.80, SD = 9.80). The ratio of approved HITs vs. total completions is 92.40%. In terms of self-rated SES (Social-economic status), the percentage of selecting R01(poorest) to R09 (richest) are: 2.16%, 11.26%, 24.68%, 16.02%, 20.35%, 14.29%, 9.52%, 1.30%, 0.43%.</p><p>To assess we also collected the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Skapinakis, 2014)</ref> and the Behavioral Anger Response Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Miers et al., 2007)</ref>. The raw trait anxiety score has a mean of 42.32, and an SD of 11.39; the raw direct anger-approach score has a mean of 8.91, and an SD of 2.33.</p><p>Participants' Worker IDs were initially matched with the corresponding MTurk records to confirm HIT approval and verify eligibility. This is only done to check the status of task completion, and no data were analyzed at this stage. All personal identifiers, including the Mturk Worker's IDs were subsequently removed before entering analysis.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the NIH Institutional Review Board Operations (NIH-IRBO), Reference Number 528098 . All participants provided informed consent online before participating in the study.</p><p>By employing these inclusion criteria and data verification methods, we aimed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the findings from this study. However, it is important to note that the MTurk population may not be fully representative of the general population, and thus the external validity of the results may be limited.</p><p>Data and codes for the analysis can be found at our OSF registration page: https://osf.io/y5qv4/</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Procedure</head><p>The basic elements of our experiments are presented below. In the beginning of each trial, participants watch a short video (10 seconds) excerpted from a horror movie scene (Threat). They are instructed to put themselves in the shoes of the threatened characters in the video and make choices that they consider to be best. They are instructed that the "best" choices would maximally increase the characters' chances of survival. Note that the outcomes of the movies (hence the result of their decisions) are not revealed at the end of the trials. This help enhance participants' impression that their choices can actually shape the development of the events in the movie and minimizes the possibility that previous outcomes would impact later choices.</p><p>Each threat presentation is accompanied by the depiction of both the fight affordance (fight facilitated or fight blocked) and the escape affordance (escape facilitated or escape blocked condition). This is a within-subjects factorial design with 2 factors (fight affordance X escape affordance) with 2 levels each (relevant and control). Each participant will be asked to watch a total number of 40 video clips paired with the 4 affordance levels. A list of affordances can be found in Supplementary Stimulus -Supplementary Materials.</p><p>After the presentation of the movie clips, participants are asked to make a choice between approach behavior (fight through the situation) and avoidance behavior (escape from the situation). Participants can choose either "fight" or "escape" on each decision trial. To simulate realistic environmental affordances, the "fight" or "escape" choices were expressed in a descriptive language like "Use the shovel to fight back". The choice was dichotomous and encoded as 1 and 0 respectively. Finally, after making their choices, participants are asked to rate their emotions, by being asked "How fearful do you feel?" and "How angry do you feel?" by moving a cursor on the screen to match a number that reflects their relative rating of the question. A continuous scale bar ranging from 1 (not angry/fearful at all) to 10 (very angry/fearful) was used for the rating. Participants can freely move the cursor on the scale to indicate their rating.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Randomization</head><p>We use block randomization, where each participant is randomly assigned to a seed-generated order of video presentations. The presented threat videos are the same across participantsonly the orders of presentation were altered. The purpose of the randomization is for counterbalancing, and to account for the familiarity brought by the same movies. During each trial, the participant is first presented with a horror movie clip, where the protagonist needs to make an approach-avoidance decision for survival. The participant is then presented with information regarding the environmental affordances, including the fight affordance (e.g., having tools that can be used as a weapon or not) and the escape affordance (e.g., whether the escape route is blocked or not). With this affordance information, participants make their survival decisions and rate their emotional responses. (B) Fearfulness rating for the sample movies. Clips from the horror scenes are rated more fearful than the non-horror scenes. This offers evidence that the survival decisions were prompted out of a genuine feeling of fear. Please refer to Standalone Rating Task -Supplementary Materials. (C) Examples sources of the horror movie clips. The clips that were rated the scariest are notably The Conjuring and The Thing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Analysis</head><p>Hypothesis 1 (H1): Environmental affordance impacts behaviors under threat. In the weapon condition trials we expected that participants would be more likely to choose to fight rather than flee compared to the non-weapon conditions (regardless of escape affordance). Similarly, in evadable trials, we expected that participants would be more likely to choose to flee rather than to fight, compared to the non-evadable trials (regardless of fight affordance) this corresponds to H1 in the following: https://osf .io/kxnyp for fight affordance, https://osf.io/sjcwu for escape affordance.</p><p>To test H1, we conducted a χ2 -test comparing the percentage of participants' fight choices out weapon vs. non-weapon trials, and in evadable vs.non-evadable trials. The inference criterion was a p &lt; 0.05 in each of the two χ2 -tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesis 2 (H2):</head><p>Environmental affordance impacts the experience of emotion under threat. We expected that participants would rate themselves as angrier in weapon trials compared to non-weapon trials and that participants would rate themselves as more fearful in evadable trials compared to non-evadable trials. This corresponds to H2 and H3 in the following: https://osf.io/kxnyp for fight affordance, https://osf.io/sjcwu for escape affordance.</p><p>To test H2, we used two methods, frequentist, and Bayesian. First, we applied repeatedmeasures, two-way ANOVA (Affordance X Choice) for participants' fear ratings and anger ratings. The coefficient of interest for H2 is the main effect of the affordance. We also looked at the interaction term between affordance and choice. The inference criterion was a p &lt; 0.05 in the coefficient estimates for the two ANOVA models. Second, to address the crossed-random effects structure in our design, we constructed a Bayesian mixed effects model to look at the relationship between emotional ratings and decisions. For the Bayesian analysis, we used the framework for Multilevel linear models (MLM) described in Scandola, M., &amp; Tidoni, E. (2021). By recursively modifying the model structure and transforming random slopes to complex random intercepts (CRIs), the method reduces typeone error inflation and produces reliable model structures. While the standard MLM is usually fitted in a frequentist framework, if one tries to include the maximal varying structure (as in the case for the affordance data), the model tends either not to converge, or to give aberrant estimations of the correlation between varying effects (Bates et al., 2015). On the other hand, fitting the maximal varying effect structure has been explicitly recommended, and can be done with a Bayesian framework without non-convergence problems <ref type="bibr">(Bates et al., 2015a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Eager &amp; Roy, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">67 Nicenboim &amp; Vasishth, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sorensen, Hohenstein, &amp; Vasishth, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>For our models, the null hypothesis postulates that the estimates of a corresponding item in the model is no different than 0. The alternative hypothesis postulates that there is enough evidence to conclude the estimates to be non-zero. We report the estimates, 95% credibility interval, and corresponding Bayes factors with regards to the null. Following the standard in Kass, R. E., &amp; Raftery, A. E. (1995), while a Bayes factor = 1 indicates no evidence for the alternative hypothesis, Bayes factor between 1 and 3 indicates anecdotal evidence for the alternative hypothesis; Bayes factor between 3 and 10 indicates moderate evidence for the alternative hypothesis; Bayes factor &gt; 10 indicates strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jeffreys, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>Bayesian analysis was performed through the brms computation package <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bürkner, 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Hypothesis 1: to test hypothesis 1 (H1), that environmental affordance impacts behaviors under threat, we examined the participants' decisions to fight or flee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>On each trial, 4 possible combinations of affordances exist:</head><p>1) weapon + evadable condition 2) non-weapon + evadable condition 3) weapon + non-evadable condition 4) non-weapon + non-evadable condition</p><p>In the analysis to test hypothesis 1 (H1), we collapsed across escape affordances when analysing fight affordances and vice-versa. According to our H1, people would choose to fight more in weapon conditions (1 and 3) compared to non-weapon conditions (2 and 4). People would choose to escape more in evadable conditions (1 and 2) compared to non-evadable conditions (3 and 4).</p><p>Overal, participants chose to escape more than fight, given the seemingly non-opposable threat presented by the horror movie clips. We compared participant's percentage of fight choices in weapon conditions (1 and 3) vs. non weapon conditions (2 and 4). As predicted, participants chose to fight more during the weapon conditions (fight chosen: 41.54%, 95% CI = [38.68%, 44.40%]), compared to non-weapon conditions (fight chosen: 16.84%, 95% CI = [14.64%, 19.04%]; χ2 =1544.59, p &lt; 0.001), and escape more in the evadable conditions (escape chosen: 80.37%, 95% CI = [78.27%, 82.47%]) compared to the non-evadable conditions (escape chosen: 66.37%, 95% CI = [63.56%, 69.18%]; χ2 =486.07, p &lt; 0.001). <ref type="figure">(figure 2(A)</ref>) This suggests that in accordance with our theory, people are more likely to choose actions that are favored by the environmental affordances and confirms hypothesis 1 (H1).</p><p>Hypothesis 2: To investigate hypothesis 2 (H2), that environmental affordance impacts the experience of emotion under threat, we applied repeated-measures, two-way ANOVA (Affordance X Choice) for both the anger emotional ratings and fear emotional ratings in the experiment. In these analyses we again collapsed across escape affordances when analysing fight affordances and vice-versa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>More anger when having a weapon; but only when the decision is to fight</head><p>When looking at anger ratings accompanying their behavior choices, we found that participants rated themselves as angrier in the weapon conditions (1 and 3; mean anger rating [95% CI] = 4.59 <ref type="bibr">[4.28, 4.90]</ref>), compared to the non-weapon conditions (2 and 4; mean anger rating [95% CI] = 3.71 [3.41, 4.01]). As shown in <ref type="figure">figure 2(B)</ref>, the difference in anger ratings can be observed on the individual level (mean difference [95% CI] = 0.88 <ref type="bibr">[0.27, 1.49]</ref>).</p><p>By applying a repeated-measures, two-way ANOVA (Affordance X Choice) for the anger ratings, we observed both a main effect of affordance (F2.60, 319.99 = 93.588, p &lt; 0.001) and an interaction between affordance and choice (F2.73, 355.74 = 37.760, p &lt; 0.001). Post hoc comparisons showed that anger ratings were higher in the weapon conditions compared to the non-weapon conditions, when the choice is to fight (anger rating in weapon conditions [95% CI] = 5. <ref type="bibr">24 [4.83, 5.65]</ref>; anger rating in non-weapon conditions [95% CI] = 3.69 [3.30, 4.09];W-NE vs. NW-NE, T247 = 13.27, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Notably, there were no significant differences in anger ratings between evadable (mean anger rating [95% CI] = 4.07 [1.72, 6.42]) and non-evadable (mean anger rating [95% CI] = 4.23 [1.90, 6.56]) conditions (NW -E vs. NW -NE, T247 = 2.10, p = 0.22).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>More fear when the escape is harder; but only when the decision is to escape</head><p>By applying a repeated-measures, two-way ANOVA (Affordance X Choice) for the fear ratings, we observed both a main effect of affordance (F2.48, 305.47 = 130.391, p &lt; 0.001) and an interaction between affordance and choice (F2.50, 307.68 = 13.177, p = 0.03). Post hoc comparisons showed that fear ratings were higher in the non-evadable conditions compared to the evadable conditions, when the choice is to escape (fear rating in escapable conditions [95% CI] = 5.95 <ref type="bibr">[5.60, 6.30]</ref>; fear rating in non-escapable conditions [95% CI] = 6.51 <ref type="bibr">[6.16, 6</ref>.87];NW-E vs. NW-NE, T247 = 6.60, p &lt; 0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Variances explained by inter-and intra-individual differences</head><p>We also calculated the variances explained by inter-individual (between-group) differences and intra-individual (within-group) differences, expressed as the ratio of sum of squares: SS_within/SS_total and SS_between/SS_total. For anger ratings, the inter-individual variance ratio is 0.612, while the intra-individual variance ratio is 0.388; for fear ratings, the interindividual variance ratio is 0.618, while the intra-individual variance ratio is 0.381. This suggests that participant's subjective expression of emotions are not governed by differences in their traits, but rather largely influenced by environmental affordances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian Statistics</head><p>A Bayesian multilevel linear model was fitted using the brm function from the brms package in R. Two models were fitted for anger ratings and fear ratings respectively, with anger and fear predicted by participants' choice, affordance conditions, their interactions, and all the related random structures. The full details of the model can be found in Bayesian Models -Supplementary Materials.</p><p>In the anger rating model, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">figure 3(A)</ref>, the Bayesian multilinear model revealed a significant interaction between fight Affordance and Choices on anger rating (Estimate = 1.47, 95% CI [1.23, 1.72]; BF against null model without interaction = 22.49). This suggests that the effect of affordance on anger rating depends on the choices participants made -consistent with our findings in the ANOVA analysis.</p><p>The estimate of 1.47, with a BF of 22.49 indicates strong evidence for a large effect: when participants are in the weapon condition and make the decision to fight, the anger rating changes by 1.47. With the rating ranging from 0 to 10, it represents about 15% of the total scale in the anger rating.</p><p>For the main effect of Choice we found moderate evidence for a medium effect (Estimate = -0.37, 95%CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.62,-0.11]</ref>; BF against null model without main effect of choice = 4.11).</p><p>For the main effect of Affordance we found strong evidence for a medium effect (Estimate = 0.24, 95%CI [0.07, .0.41]; BF against null model without main effect of Affordance = 10.40). Consistent with the interaction term in the ANOVA anlalysis, there is strong evidence for a large effect from Affordance X Choice (Estimate = 1.47, 95% CI [1.23, 1.72]); (B): Fixed effects from the Bayesian multilevel linear model predicting fear ratings. With no reliable effect from either affordance, choice or trait anxiety themselves, we found a small effect from Affordance X Choice (Estimate = 0.32, 95%CI [0.09, 0.71]).</p><p>In the fear rating model, as shown in figure 3(B), there was moderate evidence for a medium effect of the interaction term between Affordance and Choices on fear ratings (Estimate = 0.32, 95%CI [0.09, 0.71]; BF against null model without the interaction: 7.27). Unlike the ANOVA analysis, there were no reliable main effects from either Choice (Estimate = 0.24, 95%CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.09, 0.57]</ref>; BF against null model without the main effect of Choice: 2.91) or Affordance (Estimate = -0.34, 95%CI <ref type="bibr">[-0.50, -0.17]</ref>; BF against null model without the main effect of Affordance: 3.10). Both the interaction and main effects are either unreliable or small, and this seems to be resulting from the weaker effect of affordance on fear, compared to anger ratings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This paper reveals environmental affordances to play a crucial role in decision-making and emotional experiences under threat. Our findings revealed that affordances, in the form of the availability of weapons and evadability of a situation, significantly influenced the choices and emotions of individuals under threat, providing support for Hypothesis 1 (H1) and Hypothesis 2 (H2). These results contribute to our understanding of the intricate relationship between environmental affordances, decision-making, and emotions in contexts of threat.</p><p>Our analysis of H1 showed that participants were more likely to engage in a fight when a weapon was available and attempt escape when the situation was evadable. This aligns with affordance theory's assertion that human behavior adapts according to the opportunities and constraints of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chemero, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gibson, 1979)</ref>. Our findings also extend prior research on the influence of situational factors on decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gross &amp; Jazaieri, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lerner et al., 2015)</ref> by specifically emphasizing the importance of environmental affordances in guiding individuals' choices under threat.</p><p>In relation to H2, our findings indicated that the presence of environmental affordances impacted participants' emotional experiences under threat. We observed that participants reported feeling angrier when a weapon was available and when they chose to fight. This finding is consistent with the appraisal theory of emotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lazarus, 1966)</ref>, suggesting that emotions arise from cognitive appraisals of situational factors, like the presence of a weapon in this instance. Conversely, participants reported feeling more fearful when the situation was non-evadable, aligning with previous research that highlights the heightened perception of threat when escape options are limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Blanchard et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fanselow, 1994)</ref>.</p><p>Our findings challenge the notion that affective experience are explained by inter-individual differences. Indeed, in the frequentist analysis, 61.20% and 61.8% of variances were explained by inter-individual differences in predicting anger and fear ratings respectively. The lack of trait dominance is also desmontrated by the Bayesian models. The impact of environmental affordances on both decision-making and emotional experience underscores the importance of considering the interplay between individual traits and environmental factors when studying affect and behavior.</p><p>Our results not only have implications for emotion theory, but also for clinical psychology, psychiatry, and public health. In terms of emotion theory, our findings lend substantial evidence to the idea that subjective affective experiences involve computational processes of environmental contingencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barrett, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Seth, 2013)</ref>. In clinical psychology and psychiatry, our results suggest that changes in subjective affective experiences, which are central to psychological well-being and psychiatric disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bauer &amp; Mohiyeddini, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Diener et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Watson et al., 1988)</ref>, could be achieved by modifying affordances and individuals' perceptions of their environment. Additionally, our findings may imply that the presence of weapons or other indicators of potential violent action could increase risk not only through their availability <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Hemenway &amp; Miller, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Monuteaux et al., 2015)</ref>, but also through the subjective affective experiences they induce.</p><p>We acknowledge the limitations of our study, including the less variable escape affordances, compared to weapon affordances. While fight affordances are presented in the form of different items, escape affordances are shown only as either open exits or partially blocked exits. This could have resulted in less engagement with the escape affordances, and contributed to the lack of main effects in our Bayesian analysis. On the other hand, the use of hypothetical horror clips only allowed us to examine the immediate impact of environmental affordances on decision-making and emotional experiences. In addition, our affordances were binary in nature, and future experiments should use parametrically varied affordances to demonstrate doseresponse effects.</p><p>In conclusion, our investigation has demonstrated that environmental affordances drive both decision-making and emotional expressions in threatening situations. Notably, changes in emotions occur congruently when environments favor the decisions. These results provide a window into the role of environmental affordances in adaptive decisions towards threat. Future studies could parametrically vary affordances, develop more accurate computational models accounting for this mechanism, and expand focus to societal level phenomena.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>(A) Experimental Procedures.</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size rationale</head><p>We performed the power analysis using G-power (cite). For a target effect size f = 0.25, and power = 0.95, and an assumption of correlation among repeated measures = 0.5, the estimated required sample size is n = 152. The simulated actual power is 0.95514.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample size rationale (Bayesian)</head><p>The Bayesian power is calculated on the full model (anger_rating ~ anxiety + stim_rating+ affordance + choice + affordance:choice + (affordance + choice + affordance:choice|subject) + (affordance + choice + affordance:choice|type)), as the percentage of simulations that has a lower limit og the 95% interval (Q2.5) greater than 0, indicating a non-trivial effect. Specifically, the power is calculated for the interaction term, Affordance X Choice.</p><p>We set i = 100 as the increment of simulation indices. With n = 100, the Bayes Power = 0.488; And when n= 250, the Bayes Power = 0.868.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standalone rating task</head><p>Ratings scores for neutral (green) and horror (red) clips. Note that for each stimulus pair, the neutral clips were obtained from the same movie scene as the horror clips. In the independent rating task, a different set of Mturk participants (sample size = 100) were asked to rate the fearfulness of the horror movie clips used in the main experiment. They were only presented with the movie clips alone, without the affordances nor decisions to make. This is a proof of concept that the horror movies are scary enough to elicit defensive responses and generate adaptive behavioral choices. Overall, participants' mean rating of fearfulness was 4.49 (3.98), with a relatively balanced distribution over different stimuli.</p><p>We then compared the rating data from the horror scene clips to the control experiment, where neutral clips from the same movies were paired and used. Bearing a few exceptions, most horror scenes were rated as more scary than the neutral scenes (t(19) = 41.03, p &lt; 0.001). This confirms that the high fearfulness ratings for the selected clips were not from the natural spectrum from the rating distribution, and that the horror movies clips were effective in inducing fear.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian Models</head><p>We constructed two Bayesian mixed effects model to look at the relationship between emotional ratings and decisions. The full models are expressed in pseudo-code as shown below:</p><p>anger_rating ~ trait_anxiety + trait_anger + stim_rating+ affordance + choice + affordance:choice + (affordance + choice + affordance:choice|subject) + (affordance + choice + affordance:choice|type) fear_rating ~ trait_anxiety + trait_anger + stim_rating+ affordance + choice + affordance:choice + (affordance + choice + affordance:choice|subject) + (affordance + choice + affordance:choice|type) "Fear_rating" and "anger_rating" are participants' emotional ratings during the task. "Trait_anxiety" and "trait_anger" are questionnaires response scores from the STAI inventory and Anger-approach inventory. "Affordance" and "choice" represent affordance conditions and</p></div>			</div>
