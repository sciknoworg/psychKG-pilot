				<p>A burgeoning literature has linked the use of new technologies to an increasing burden of mental health problems. However, one important methodological concern with this association has been the confounding effect that poor mental health can have on self-reported estimates of technology use. Because the existing literature has focused on self-reported use to measure technology use, this bias may lead to inappropriate inferences being made about the impact of technology on its users. To examine this further, Response Surface Analysis was applied to data from 511 smartphone users to disentangle the effects of logged and self-reported smartphone use on depression, in a conceptual replication of Sewall and Parry (2021). This analysis is then extended to include negative urgency, a facet of impulsiveness associated with increased risky decision-making when experiencing strong negative emotions. The results broadly replicate those of Sewall and Parry (2021), by finding a rising ridge asymmetric</p>

Depression scores were higher when smartphone estimates were congruent and high, and among people who overestimated their actual use. Effects of negative urgency were weaker than depression and inconsistent. These findings add further support to the hypothesis that measurement bias confounds the association between smartphone use and mental health.</p><p>As new technologies have developed and become adopted by society, there has been an increasing demand to understand the effects they have on users. Consequently, a large literature has become dedicated to investigating the positive and negative implications of the volume and type of technology use on human behaviour. There has been particular interest in the volume of technology use, or "screen time", and specific patterns of technology use (i.e. smartphone, social media, internet, gaming). These have been linked with negative mental health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Twenge et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Twenge et al., 2022)</ref>, and considered problematic behaviours in and of themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Kwon et al., 2013)</ref>. Drawing on common social science measures, many of these studies rely on self-reported indicators of tech use <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(James et al., 2022)</ref>. However, there is reason to believe that estimates of tech use are inaccurate and biased when elicited via self-report <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Ernala et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Parry et al., 2021)</ref>, compared to measures taken from the devices or platforms themselves. Specifically, it has been proposed that cognitive and attributional biases that are common with disordered mood may drive overestimations of technology usage . The implications of this discrepancy are notable. If there is systematic bias in self-report measures, and factors such as depression severity impact the discrepancy between self-reported and actual behaviour, these negative effects of technology might be overstated.</p><p>That is, the reason there is an association between depression and self-reports of (excessive) technology use is in part because depression is driving overestimations of tech use. This in turn is then being associated back with depression and being used to make biased conclusions regarding the effect of technology use on depression and other mental health variables. In other words, there is a risk that the findings from studies concluding that technology use leads to worse mental health outcomes may be at risk of reverse causality. Understanding the mechanisms behind this bias is therefore of considerable importance. To this end, we report a conceptual replication of the findings of a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sewall and Parry (2021)</ref>, who used Response Surface Analysis (RSA) to investigate levels of depression and incongruence between self-reported and actual usage in digital media use (DMU).</p><p>Response Surface Analysis estimates a polynomial regression between two independent variables (IV) to understand the relationship between these scores and a dependent variable (DV). Typically, the IV's are measuring the same underlying phenomenon e.g. selfand other reports, or perceived and actual logs of behaviour, onto outcomes such as wellbeing.</p><p>Recent developments in this field have incorporated cubic, as well as quadratic parameters, to capture additional nonlinear relationships between these factors. The parameters that are estimated can be used to understand whether there is a congruence effect, characterised by the largest outcome on the DV when the two IVs are in concordance with one another, or not. This method is more powerful than other techniques (e.g. analysing discrepancy scores) and have fewer methodological drawbacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Humberg et al., 2019)</ref>. RSA has been used in a number of contexts, such as looking at whether similarities in personality traits between dyads leads to better outcomes (e.g. likelihood of friendship, relationship satisfaction), or whether accurate estimations of a construct are associated with better or worse outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Humberg et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>RSA has been used minimally as a method to investigate smartphone usage, with two studies incorporating RSA thus far. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sewall and Parry (2021)</ref> applied RSA to model the effects of self-reported and logged smartphone usage on depression scores, finding that there was an asymmetric congruence effect, where overestimation of phone usage was associated with greater depression than underestimation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hitcham et al. (2023)</ref> then used the method, again using self-reported and logged smartphone use, to look at incongruence effects in smartphone addiction scores. This analysis showed a similar pattern. Although there was strong evidence of congruence overall, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hitcham et al. (2023)</ref> found an additional additive effect of self-reported smartphone usage, such that self-reported use was more directly associated with smartphone addiction than logged use. In both cases, asymmetric effects appeared to be largely driven by overestimates of perceived smartphone usage, which is associated with higher estimates of mental health morbidity, but not vice versa.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Study</head><p>The aims of this study are twofold. The first aim is to directly replicate the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sewall and Parry (2021)</ref> in two separate datasets. The datasets include self-reported and logged measurements of DMU, and depression, and overcome some limitations identified with the initial study. The data reported in this study comprised of both iOS and Android users, whereas the respondents in the Sewall and Parry analysis were limited to iOS users. As a result, applying RSA to this data allows us to determine if these effects are observed across a wider range of smartphone users. Second, this study uses the <ref type="bibr">PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2001</ref>) instead of the CESD-R-10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Eaton et al., 2004)</ref>. It has been previously noted that there are a range of common depression measures that capture different aspects of depression symptomology (Fried, 2017).</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to understand whether these effects are specific to certain phenomena or processes in depression or associated with more general depressive affect. Finally, although self-reported smartphone usage was only measured at baseline, the data has multiple measures of depression and logged smartphone usage, measured at baseline and two weeks after. This allows a determination of the extent to which these effects are replicable. To this end, we report a replication of Sewall and Parry (2021), using RSA, with self-reported and logged smartphone use as independent variables, and depression measured using the PHQ-9 as the dependent variable. On the basis of this prior research, our first hypothesis is there will be an asymmetric effect, with higher levels of depression observed in people who overestimate their phone use, but not vice versa.</p><p>The second aim is to examine whether this effect holds when applied to the trait of negative urgency. Negative urgency is the admixture of depressive and impulsive traits that emerges in the form of impulsive actions when negative emotions are experienced <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Settles et al., 2012)</ref>. Negative urgency is commonly associated with increased severity of a wide range of addictive behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Smith &amp; Cyders, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Zorrilla &amp; Koob, 2019)</ref>. Therefore, one possibility is that this construct may be relevant to understanding the relationship between smartphone addiction and smartphone usage. Importantly, this informs whether these incongruence effects might be driven by depression, or rather by the mixture of depression and impulsivity. If it is the latter, then there is a common contributing factor underpinning both depression and addiction related smartphone usage effects. This has the potential to further our understanding of the mechanisms behind problematic smartphone usage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>Data for this study was taken from two studies. The first two analyses were conducted on data previously reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hitcham et al. (2023)</ref>. Participants were recruited initially (T1, n= 511) in July 2021 via Prolific Academic, and volunteer on social media to complete an online questionnaire regarding smartphone usage. They were followed up two weeks later with the same questionnaire (T2, n=391) to check for re-test reliability. Respondents were a mixture of iPhone users (n=223) and Android users (n=288), had a meanage of 27.23 (SD=8.97), resided in 30 countries and a small majority identify as female (269 women, 232 men, 9 non-binary).</p><p>Those recruited through Prolific were compensated financially for their time. The second study recruited a mixture of students for course credit, and members of the general public for a multiwave study in late 2022 (n = 217, meanage = 23.477, S.D. = 11.017, 172 women, 40 men, 4 non-binary, 1 preferred not to say.. Of these, 179 owned an iPhone, and 38 had a phone operating with an Android system. Both studies received institutional ethical approval by the Ethics Committee of the School of Psychology, University of BLINDED FOR PEER REVIEW. Ethnicity data was not collected in either study. All participants provided informed consent to the study, and for the data to be shared for research purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head><p>Self-reported estimates in both studies were collected by asking participants to estimate how often they used their smartphone each day, in hours and minutes. Logged smartphone use was collected by manually entering data from proprietary screen apps (e.g. Digital Wellbeing, Screen Time) into the survey. For iPhone users, this was the average time spent on the phone in the past week. For Android users, this differed between different types of phones. In some cases, this was weekly average use, weekly total use, and daily estimates of use for each of the last seven days. These were standardized into the average number of minutes per day.</p><p>Participants then responded to a series of mental health measures. However, for the purposes of this study, only self-reported use, logged use, depression and negative urgency were analysed. Self-report data was only collected at the first wave and used in both sets of analyses. The <ref type="bibr">PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2001</ref>) was used to measure depression severity by assessing problems experienced in the last two weeks on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 'not at all' (0) to 'several days' (3). Scores range from 0-27 with higher scores indicating higher depression severity. The PHQ-9 has been used in a range of contexts and shown to have good psychometric validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Levis et al., 2019)</ref>. The UPPS-P <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cyders et al., 2014)</ref> was used to measure impulsivity, including the sub-facet of negative urgency. It provides 20 statements, with each of the five sub-facets being assessed by 4 items and is scored on a Likert scale from 'disagree strongly' (1) to 'agree strongly' (4). Each facet is scored individually and reversed scored as appropriate. For negative urgency, all items (6, 8, 13 and 15) are reverse scored.</p><p>Higher scores indicate a higher association with the impulsivity trait. The UPPS is one of the most commonly used individual difference models of impulsivity, capturing the different components of impulsiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Whiteside &amp; Lynam, 2001</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Cubic RSA was performed with depression and negative urgency as the dependent variables and logged and self-reported smartphone use, and their quadratic and cubic terms and interactions as independent variables. In addition to the cubic model, cubic asymmetric and cubic level dependent models were estimated, as well as their rising ridge alternatives. Missing data was incorporated using full information maximum likelihood. In the case of the follow-up data, the full information maximum likelihood was restricted to participants who participated in this wave of data collection.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>Descriptive statistics are reported in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. For the depression analyses, the best fitting model (adjusting for the number of parameters) was the rising ridge cubic asymmetric (RRCA) model at both time points <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>. Examination of this, and the full cubic RSA reveal a similar pattern of results. There is a rising ridge congruence effect, revealing that people reporting higher estimated and actual phone use tend to report higher depression scores. The figure also highlights how respondents tended to underestimate their phone usage. Both the cubic and RRCA models indicate that there is an asymmetric effect. Specifically, when respondents underestimated their phone use (i.e., logged use was higher), the surface of the plot is concave down, whereas it is concave up when people overestimated their use. Nonetheless, the parameters indicate that significant effects are driven by logged use (see output on OSF). At follow-up two weeks later, the same overall pattern emerges. Again, the RRCA was the bestfitting model <ref type="table">(Table 2)</ref>, and the same concave down surface was observed for people that underestimate their phone use. The overall surface is flatter, in part driven by lower overall depressive symptomology at follow-up. In contrast, in these analyses, the only significant parameters are of self-reported phone usage. The overall amount of variance explained was relatively small (R 2 = 0.077 at T1, 0.039 at T2). The findings from Study 2 replicate the findings of the Study 1 analyses in turn, and in terms of variance explained perform similarly to Time 1 (R 2 = .091).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Negative Urgency Analysis</head><p>In contrast to the depression models, although the negative urgency analyses also identify the RRCA model as the best fit, the surfaces are quite divergent between time points.</p><p>At time 1, there is a strong asymmetry effect showing underestimation of phone use strongly associated with negative urgency, but not overestimations. At time 2, this effect reverses and the surface is similar to the depression analyses. In contrast, the parameters of the regression model are more consistent in the negative urgency analyses, which identify significant main effects for self-reported phone use and its polynomial terms, but not logged usage. The amount of variance explained is smaller (R 2 = .052 at T1, .027 at T2) than the depression analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In order to investigate the congruence effects of smartphone use and depression, this study aimed to compare the RSA findings with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sewall and Parry (2021)</ref> and extend this to include the impact of negativity urgency. The findings of the RSAs on depression and negative urgency find stronger effects of smartphone usage on depression than negative urgency. Across both analyses, there is evidence for rising ridge asymmetric congruence effects, which in the majority of cases, especially for depression, is characterised by higher levels of depression and negative urgency when people report higher estimated and actual smartphone use, or when selfreported smartphone use is overestimated. The overall amount of variance explained was quite small in both sets of analyses. Smartphone use was more associated with depression than negative urgency, but in both cases, the R 2 was beneath 0.1. Nonetheless, many of the effect sizes identified in the literature on the effects of smartphone and social media on depression are of a similar magnitude in size. Therefore, it is entirely possible these effects significantly contribute to the observed mental health and technology use association. However, further analyses are needed to determine the extent to which this effect is determined by this bias.</p><p>The principal difference found compared with previous RSAs was that the rising ridge models were better fits of the data than the full cubic model, whereas in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Sewall and Parry (2021)</ref> the cubic models were a better fit. All three of these models fit the data relatively well.</p><p>Nonetheless, the overall direction of the findings is similar. In a sense, the finding of a rising ridge effect is not surprising, as the overall level of engagement with smartphones is associated with worsening depression. The crucial aspect, common across the analyses, is that there is an asymmetry where there is discordance between estimated and actual use. When people overestimate their actual use, they tend to report much higher levels of negative affect than people who underestimate their use. Therefore, while there is evidence of an overall effect of technology use on depression, this is also confounded by specific biases with perceived technology use. This finding is agnostic to the direction of the relationship between smartphone use and depression. There are theoretical accounts that have postulated that depression could be a cause, rather than a consequence of technology usage such as uses and gratifications theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Coyne et al., 2020)</ref>, or as a form of compensatory use (Kardefelt-Winther, 2014). In this account, attributional biases driven by depression lead to distorted perceptions of technology use, which explains this association rather than the maladaptive effects of technology usage.</p><p>This could be used to explain the asymmetric findings. Higher levels of depression severity have been shown in other contexts to lead to the magnification of subjective judgements of certain phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Quartana et al., 2009)</ref>. In this sense, as people use their phones a lot in everyday settings, people with greater depression severity may catastrophize their phone use, and place greater emphasis on it when it is probed in a questionnaire. Alternatively, higher levels of depression are associated with biases and deficits in both attention and/or memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Marchetti et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Mennen et al., 2019)</ref>. These may alter judgements of phone use. Further research ought to discriminate between these potential accounts.</p><p>There are some limitations to be aware of with this analysis. Although iOS estimates were relatively uniform, estimates from Android devices varied somewhat, with some reporting total hours and minutes per week, average hours and minutes per day, and values for each of the last seven days respectively. This variation is due to the variety of smartphone makes and models, and consequently, different "screen time" applications that use the Android OS.</p><p>Further research ought to ascertain the extent to which this variation might bias estimates of DMU. Additionally, as we did not verify the data from the apps (i.e. via direct upload or screenshots), there is the possibility of erroneous reporting that may affect results. Nonetheless, there are a number of strengths that distinguish this from other analyses; our analysis included iPhone and Android phone users, whereas previous studies only considered iPhone users.</p><p>Similarly, while in both studies the depression measure captures only part of the breadth of depressive symptomology (Fried, 2017), these findings hold up in another commonly used scale of depression, indicating these effects are common across different operationalizations of depression. Analyses with other measures of depressive affect would be beneficial to further confirm these findings. The similarity of findings between the CES-D-10-R and the PHQ-9</p><p>gives cause for optimism in this regard. Lastly, our estimate of self-reported smartphone use was only measured at baseline and included in both analyses, so there is a small latency between measurements in the second set of analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Response Surface Analyses of the effects of self-reported and logged smartphone usage on depression and negative urgency revealed evidence for a rising ridge cubic asymmetric model being the best fit of the data. This indicated that higher levels of negative affect were observed when self-report and logged phone use were congruent and of higher intensity.</p><p>Additionally, there was an asymmetric effect, as people who reported high levels of selfreported use but low actual use also reported greater depression. These findings further confirm that there appears to be measurement bias that affects the relationship between self-reported technology use and negative mental health. Findings that rely on self-report to draw conclusions from this should be treated with caution.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Note: LL = log likelihood, AICc = Corrected Akaike Information Criteria, CFI = Comparative Fit Index, RRCA = Rising Ridge Cubic Asymmetric, RRCL = Rising Ridge Cubic Level</figDesc></figure>
