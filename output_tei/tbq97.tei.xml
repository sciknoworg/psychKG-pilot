			<abstract>
				<p>Bias in perceptual decision making can have both sensory and decisional origins. These competing sources of bias are typically seen as static and stable over time. However, human behavior is dynamic and constantly adapting. Yet, it remains unclear if the competition between sensory and decisional biases changes over time too. We addressed this question by tracking the dynamics of sensory and decisional biases during a task that involves a visual illusion. Observers saw multiple pairs of peripherally presented faces that induce a strong illusion making the faces appear distorted and grotesque. The task was to judge whether one of the last two faces had true physical distortion (experimentally introduced in half of the trials). Initially, subjects classified most faces as distorted as exemplified by a liberal response bias. However, over the course of the experiment, this response bias gradually disappeared despite the fact that the distortion illusion remained equally strong, as demonstrated by a separate subjective rating task without artificially distorted faces. The results suggest that the sensory bias was progressively countered by an opposite decisional bias. This transition was accompanied by an increase in reaction times and a decrease in confidence relative to a condition that does not induce the visual illusion. All results were replicated in a second experiment with inverted faces. These findings demonstrate the existence of dynamic competition between sensory and decisional biases that together determine how humans make perceptual decisions. Significance Our perceptual decisions suffer from both sensory and decision biases: our judgments can be swayed by either altered sensory representation or cognitive processes. Previous research that attempts to disentangle these two sources of biases has implicitly assumed that these biases are stable over time. However, it is now well appreciated that human behavior is dynamic, and thus internal biases likely change over time too. Here, we successfully tracked the changes in sensory and decisional biases over time in the context of judgments about stimuli that induce a visual illusion, showing that decisional biases gradually adjust to compensate for a relatively constant sensory bias. Our findings demonstrate the dynamic nature of internal biases and suggest that traditional analyses that assume static biases may obscure the true underlying perceptual decision-making processes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Perceptual decision making can be influenced by both sensory and decisional biases. Sensory biases stem from the processing of sensory evidence, and are exemplified by visual illusions like the Muller-Lyer illusion <ref type="bibr">(Witt et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast, decisional biases arise within the decision-making process, and are exemplified by adjustments to response strategies in the absence of differences in sensory evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2007)</ref>. Most previous research has attempted to determine whether a particular bias occurs due to sensory <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jazayeri &amp; Movshon, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rahnev, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shams &amp; Kim, 2010)</ref>, decisional <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bang &amp; Rahnev, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bowen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Odgaard et al., 2003)</ref>, or both sensory and decisional processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Linares et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rahnev &amp; Denison, 2018)</ref>. The underlying assumption in this line of work is that sensory and decisional biases are stable and do not change over time.</p><p>However, research has shown that human behavior is inherently dynamic and that our decisions often undergo changes over time. These dynamics are well documented in fields such as reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Shteingart &amp; Loewenstein, 2014)</ref> but occur for virtually all of human behavior including low-level perceptual effects such as visual adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gao et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Webster, 2015)</ref> and perceptual learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Goldstone, 1998)</ref>. Human decisions are also known to vary on a short time scale based on immediate previous stimuli and decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Frund et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yu &amp; Cohen, 2008)</ref>, as well as drift unpredictably over longer time scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Norton et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wei et al., 2021)</ref>. Critically, even perceptual changes, such as visual adaptation, have been argued to have both sensory and decisional components <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Witthoft et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, it is likely that sensory and decisional biases are dynamically adjusted over time.</p><p>Yet, no study to date has reported the existence of dynamic changes of either sensory or decisional biases that occur predictably and consistently across participants. Most studies simply average the data across time under the implicit assumption that both types of biases remain largely stable. However, if the two biases do change over time, such averaging can lead to misleading results <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gao et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gao et al., , 2021</ref>. Therefore, it is critical to separately track the evolution of sensory and decisional biases to determine their temporal evolution.</p><p>Here we sought to determine if we can identify changes of sensory and decisional biases over the course of a single session with a perceptual task. Participants completed a task that induces the Flashed Face Distortion effect (FFDE), a visual illusion where the presentation of a series of faces leads to distorted face perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Balas &amp; Pearson, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bowden et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tangen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wen &amp; Kung, 2014)</ref>. Critically, we also included a control condition that did not produce face distortion. We found that the illusion and control condition initially featured vastly different response bias (participants were much more likely to indicate that faces are distorted in the illusion compared to the control condition), but that this difference disappeared over time. These results were driven by a stable sensory bias that was progressively countered by an opposite decisional bias, which could also be observed in reaction time and confidence data. Our findings thus demonstrate that sensory and decisional biases are dynamic and can evolve independently from each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 27 participants for Experiment 1 (12 females and 15 males, mean age = 19.74, SD = 1.68, range = 18-25) and another 27 participants for Experiment 2 (nine females and 18 males, mean age = 19.96, SD = 3.07, range = 18-31). These sample sizes were chosen to achieve 80% statistical power given a medium effect size (0.5). We recruited another 20 participants for Experiment 3 that served as a control experiment (5 females and 15 males, mean age = 20.35, SD = 1.93, range = 18-26). All participants had a normal or corrected-to-normal vision and provided signed consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Georgia Institute of Technology. Participants were recruited from the Georgia Institute of Technology and were compensated for 1 SONA credit or $10/hour.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>All experiments consisted of two conditions designed to either induce or not induce a visual illusion ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1A</ref>). In the illusion condition, we presented 15 flashes of faces that induce a known visual illusion called the Flashed Face Distortion Effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Balas &amp; Pearson, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bowden et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tangen et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wen &amp; Kung, 2014)</ref>. In this illusion, faces presented after the first few flashes begin to appear increasingly distorted and even grotesque. In contrast, in the control condition, we presented a single flash of faces that does not induce a perceptual illusion. In both cases, a single flash included two different faces presented on the left and right of fixation. In the main experiments (Experiments 1 and 2), participants' task was to indicate whether any of the last pair of faces was physically distorted. To make the task meaningful, we manually created artificially distorted faces ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B)</ref>. On half the trials from each condition, one of the last two faces was artificially distorted, whereas on the other half of the trials both faces were undistorted. In the illusion condition, the first 14 flashes always had only undistorted faces.   Each trial of Experiments 1 and 2 began with the presentation of a red dot at fixation for a random duration between 800 to 1300 ms. Depending on the condition, we then presented either 15 or a single flash of faces (height = 6 degrees, width = 6 degrees). On half the trials, each flash lasted for 250 ms, whereas on the other half of the trials, each flash lasted for 1000 ms. Independently, on half the trials, the faces were presented at 2-degree eccentricity, whereas on the other half of the trials, the faces were presented at 8-degree eccentricity. Each combination of number of flashes, duration, and eccentricity was repeated twice per block with each block having 16 trials. After the face presentation, participants saw a single response screen with three questions. The first question asked participants to indicate whether either of the last two faces was distorted. The second question asked participants to rate their confidence using a 4-point scale (not confident at all, somewhat confident, very confident, extremely confident). Finally, the third question (not analyzed in the current paper) asked participants to provide a subjective rating of the level of distortion (not distorted, minor distortion, major distortion, extreme distortion). Participants were allowed unlimited time to respond. Each question appeared on the same response screen but each subsequent question was shown only after the participant responded to the previous question. Participants completed 10 blocks corresponding to a total of 160 trials.</p><p>In Experiment 1, all faces were presented in an upright orientation. In Experiment 2 was identical to Experiment 2 except that all faces were presented in the inverted orientation.</p><p>Experiment was a control experiment designed to test whether the strength of the distortion illusion changed over time. Consequently, the experiment had the same design as Experiments 1 and 2, except for the following two changes. First, participants only indicated the subjective level of distortion (third question from Experiments and 2) but did not need to judge whether faces were objectively distorted or provide confidence. Second, we only used normal faces (i.e., no faces were artificially distorted). These changes were designed to test directly the strength of participants' subjective distortion independent of their judgments regarding objective distortion (which made question 3 difficult to interpret in Experiments 1 and 2).</p><p>To confirm that the face distortion illusion did not weaken over time, we sent out a brief, 1question survey a few weeks following Experiments 1 and 2. We asked participants "Did this illusion change over the course of the experiment?" They chose among five response options, indicating whether the illusion became much weaker, a little weaker, a little stronger, much stronger, or that it stayed the same. In Experiment 3, we collected the same survey response as in Experiments 1 and 2 immediately upon completion of the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p>To generate the artificially distorted faces, we employed five distinct distortion methods. The first four methods used the nudge function of PicMonkey Photo Editor and Graphic Design Maker (picmonkey.com). All original faces were positioned on an 8 by 8 grid, and individual points on each face were shifted manually to produce different distortions. The four artificial face distortions involved (1) stretching the eyes and mouth, (2) squeezing the eyes and mouth,</p><p>(3) twisting the eyes and mouth, and (4) stretching the eyes, nose, and contour of the face (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref> for examples of distorted faces). For the fifth distortion method, we utilized custom MATLAB codes (The MathWorks, Natick, MA) to contract the eyes and mouth of each face using algorithms described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Webster &amp; Maclin's (1999)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Yamashita et al.'s (2005)</ref> (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1B</ref> for an example distorted face). In addition, we adjusted the luminance of the face images to match the average luminance of the face set. The original face images were selected from the Karolinska directed emotional faces database <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lundqvist et al., 1998)</ref>. We chose 15 male and 15 female faces, and created five distorted versions of each face according to all five methods described above. The faces presented were randomly drawn so that in the illusion condition each of the 30 identities was shown exactly once, whereas in the control condition two identities were selected randomly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses</head><p>To maximize power, we merged the data from different flash durations and eccentricities. For each block, we computed sensitivity (d') and response criterion (c) based on the signal detection theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Green &amp; Swets, 1966)</ref> formulas:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">′ = −1 (ℎ ) − −1 ( ) and = − −1 (ℎ ) + −1 ( ) 2</formula><p>where −1 represents the inverse of the cumulative standard normal distribution transforming the hit rate and false alarm rate to Z scores. We coded objectively distorted faces as the nontarget and non-distorted faces as the target. As such, a larger value indicates a bias towards saying "distorted" more frequently, which indexes the presence of the flashed face distortion illusion.</p><p>For each block, we performed paired t-tests to compare d', the response criterion, confidence rating, and reaction time (RT) between the illusion and control conditions. The RT was computed as the time it took participants to respond to the initial question regarding whether either of the two faces was distorted. In addition, we fitted the data of the 10 blocks with linear regression models and performed paired t-tests on the slopes of the models to determine how d', c, confidence, and RT changed over blocks. In addition, we report Cohen's d and the Bayes factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Krekelberg, 2022)</ref> for all t-tests.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data and code availability</head><p>All original and manually distorted faces, as well as all data and analysis code are available at https://osf.io/bkv3r. Experiment 1: Sensory bias progressively counteracted by an opposite decisional bias for upright faces</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response bias diminishes over time for the illusion condition only</head><p>In Experiment 1, participants completed a face distortion detection task over 10 blocks where all the faces were presented upright. Critically, there were two conditions: an illusion condition that made even normal faces to appear distorted, and a control condition that did not induce illusory percepts. We first examined how response bias changed over time in the illusion and control conditions. We found that, initially, participants were much more biased towards saying "distorted" in the illusion compared to the control condition, but that this difference disappeared over time <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2A)</ref>. Indeed, we observed a large disparity in response bias between the illusion and control conditions for each of the first three blocks (all p's &lt; .0002), but this disparity completely disappeared by the last three blocks (all p's &gt; .64). To capture the change over time, we computed the slope of the response criterion over the 10 blocks and found that the response criterion became progressively less biased over blocks in the illusion condition (t(26) = 4.09, p = .0004, BF10 = 81.55, Cohen's d = .79), but remained relatively stable over blocks in the control condition (t(26) = 11.54, p = .14, BF01 = 1.72, Cohen's d = .30).</p><p>Critically, the response criterion decreased at a faster rate in the illusion than in the control condition (t(26) = 5.23, p = 1.8x10 5 , BF10 = 1.2x10 3 , Cohen's d = 1.01). This pattern of results demonstrates that participants experienced strong distortion percepts in the illusion condition.</p><p>Like many other illusions, the face distortion illusion does not become weaker over time, which suggests that participants adjusted their decisional bias over time to counteract the perceptual bias caused by the illusion.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reac�on Time</head><p>One possibility is that the decrease in response bias in the illusion condition is due to a corresponding change in sensitivity. To check if this is the case, we examined how sensitivity (d') changed over time in each condition. We found that d' was overall higher in the control compared to the illusion condition (p &lt; .05 for 9 out of 10 blocks, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B</ref>). Sensitivity did not change over time in the control condition (t(26) = .45, p = .65, BF01 = 4.46, Cohen's d = .09), but increased slightly across blocks in the illusion condition (t(26) = 3.68 p = .001, BF10 = 31.93,</p><p>Cohen's d = .71). These results are consistent with the notion that participants exhibited faster learning in the more unusual illusion condition, as also suggested by a significant difference in the rate of d' increase (t(26) = 2.94, p = .007, BF10 = 6.52, Cohen's d = .57). These results do not exclude the possibility that the response bias is partially explained by d' but make it unlikely that the shift in response bias is solely explained by the change in sensitivity (we return to this issue in Experiment 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shift in response bias in the illusion condition is accompanied by corresponding shifts in RT and confidence</head><p>The results so far suggest that participants continuously adjusted their decisional bias to counteract the perceptual bias in the illusion condition. We therefore examined whether such decisional adjustment would be reflected in a change in RT and confidence over time. This was indeed the case: both RT and confidence was similar for the illusion and control conditions in the early blocks for diverged in the later blocks. Specifically, RT was equivalent between the two conditions in the initial three blocks (all p's &gt; .38) but was longer in the illusion condition in the last three blocks (all p's &lt; .034; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2C</ref>). Correspondingly, the rate of decrease in RT over time was slower for the illusion compared to the control condition (t(26) = 4.51, p = 1.2x10 , BF10 = 222.08, Cohen's d = 0.87). Similarly, confidence was also equivalent between the two conditions in the initial three blocks (all p's &gt; .19) but was lower in the illusion condition in the last three blocks (all p's &lt; .05; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2D</ref>). This difference was again reflected in a significant difference in the rate of change in confidence for the illusion and control conditions (t(26) = 3.20, p = .004, BF10 = 11.14, Cohen's d = .62). These results are consistent with a gradual increase in decisional bias over time in the illusion condition, resulting in slower decisions and decreased subjective confidence in the illusion compared to the control condition.</p><p>Experiment 2: Replication with inverted faces Experiment 1 used the standard method for inducing the face distortion illusion by employing upright faces. However, this design led to an increase in sensitivity over time in the illusion but not in the control condition, thus potentially complicating the interpretation of the response bias results. Experiment 2 used an identical design as Experiment 1 except that all faces were inverted instead of upright. This design allowed us to replicate Experiment 1 while decreasing the difference in the d' change over time between the illusion and control conditions as the face inversion is likely to cause similar learning in both conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response bias diminishes over time for the illusion condition only</head><p>We first examined how response bias changed over time in the illusion and control conditions.</p><p>We found that, initially, participants were much more biased towards saying "distorted" in the illusion compared to the control condition, but that this difference disappeared over time ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3A)</ref>. Indeed, we observed a large disparity in response bias between the illusion and control conditions for each of the first five blocks (all p's &lt; .006), but this disparity completely disappeared in the last five blocks (all p's &gt; .07). To capture the change over time, we computed the slope of the response criterion over the 10 blocks and found that the response criterion became progressively less biased over blocks in the illusion condition (t(26) = 3.42, p = .002,  To check whether the decrease in response bias in the illusion condition is due to a corresponding change in sensitivity, we examined how sensitivity (d') changed over time in each condition. In Experiment 1, we found that the illusion condition exhibited a faster increase  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Shift in response bias in the illusion condition is accompanied by corresponding shifts in RT and confidence</head><p>As in Experiment 1, we again examined whether response bias shift in the illusion condition was reflected in a change in RT and confidence over time. We found that RT was shorter for the illusion compared to the control condition in the first block (t(26) = 2.27, p = .03, BF10 = 2.98, Cohen's d = .49), but was longer in the illusion compared to the control condition in eight of the remaining nine blocks (p's &lt; .03 for each of the eight blocks, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3C</ref>). Correspondingly, the rate of decrease in RT over time was smaller for the illusion compared to the control condition (t(26) = 5.63, p = 6.5x10 -6 , BF10 = 3.2x10 3 , Cohen's d = 1.08). Similarly, confidence was equivalent between the two conditions in the initial six blocks (all p's &gt; .06), but was lower in the illusion condition during the 7 th and 9 th blocks (both p's &lt; .05; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3D</ref>). This difference was again reflected in a significant difference in the rate of change in confidence for the illusion and control conditions (t(26) = 2.39, p = .02, BF10 = 2.21, Cohen's d = .46). These results replicate our findings in Experiment 1 of different dynamics in response bias, RT, and confidence between the illusion and control conditions.</p><p>Experiment 3: The face distortion illusion does not weaken over time</p><p>The results of Experiments 1 and 2 are consistent with the interpretation that the perceptual bias induced by the face distortion illusion is counteracted over time by an opposite decisional bias. However, this interpretation relies on the assumption that the face distortion illusion did not weaken over time. We investigated this possibility in two different ways. First, we conducted a post-experiment survey for the participants in Experiments 1 and 2. Second, we conducted a new experiment where we could track how the strength of the face distortion illusion changed over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-experiment survey for Experiments 1 and 2</head><p>After the completion of Experiments 1 and 2, we contacted all 54 participants asking them to respond to a brief, 1-question survey. Specifically, we asked participants "Did this illusion change over the course of the experiment?" and gave them five response options indicating that the illusion became much weaker, a little weaker, a little stronger, much stronger, or that it stayed the same. We obtained responses from 35 participants (65% response rate). No participant reported that the illusion became much weaker, and only 8 participants (23%)</p><p>indicated that it became a little weaker. In contrast, the most common response was that the illusion became a little stronger (16 participants; 46%) and 2 participants (6%) indicated that it became much stronger ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4A</ref>). Therefore, participants overall experienced the face distortion illusion as not decreasing in strength and, in fact, becoming slightly stronger over time. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results of Experiment 3</head><p>The results of the post-experiment surveys for Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that the face distortion illusion did not weaken over time. However, the surveys were only completed by about two thirds of the participants and only after a period of several weeks. Therefore, to investigate this issue directly, we conducted a new study (Experiment 3) where no artificially distorted faces were included. We asked participants after each trial to rate the subjective strength of face distortion they perceived. Note that we collected similar ratings in Experiments 1 and 2, but the question there was ambiguous because the presence of artificially distorted faces likely led some participants to report on their belief that a face is artificially distorted We first confirmed that participants' distortion ratings were significantly higher in the illusion compared to the control condition for all blocks (all p's &lt; 4.7*10 -7 ; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4B</ref>). Critically, we examined the change in the distortion ratings over the 10 blocks. We found that the distortion strength did no change over time in the illusion condition (t(19) = .06, p = .95, BF01 = 4.30,</p><p>Cohen's d = .01), though it slightly increased for the control condition (t(19) = 2.45, p = .02, BF10</p><p>= 2.50, Cohen's d= .55). These results indicate that the subjective illusion of distortion did not weaken over time. Finally, we also collected a post-experiment survey as in Experiments 1 and 2 (but this time immediately after the completion of the experiment). Again, no participant indicated that the face distortion illusion became much weaker and only 2 out of 20 participants (10%) indicated that it became a little weaker ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4C</ref>). The most common response again was that the illusion became a little stronger over time <ref type="bibr">(12 participants; 60%)</ref> and one participant (5%) thought that it became much stronger over time. Overall, these results strongly support the notion that the strength of the face distortion illusion either remained consistent over time or perhaps even slightly increased. Therefore, the decrease in response bias in Experiments 1 and 2 is most consistent with decisional bias counteracting the sensory bias, rather than the sensory bias becoming weaker over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Perceptual decision making contains at least two components: sensory processing, primarily occurring within an early time window in occipital areas, and decision-making, primarily occurring at a later time window in parietal and frontal areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mostert et al., 2015)</ref>. The sensory and decisional components of perceptual decision making can separately bias the final perceptual decision, but distinguishing between these two types of biases has been challenging, and the dynamics of these biases are virtually unknown. Here we show that sensory and decisional biases can be dissociated during a single session in which participants completed a task that induced a face distortion illusion. We showed that response criterion, which encompasses both sensory and decisional biases, decreases substantially over the course of the session. Using a separate distortion rating task, we demonstrated that the sensory signal remained unchanged over the course of the session, signifying that it is the decision bias that was dynamically adjusted by participants. In accordance with this interpretation, we also found corresponding changes in both RT and confidence. These findings offer compelling evidence for the differentiation of sensory and decisional biases, and reveal a dynamic competition between sensory and decisional biases such that decisional processes can gradually counteract sensory processing that is judged to be illusory.</p><p>Studies to date have struggled separating sensory and perceptual biases, making it difficult to track individual changes separately. For example, while signal detection theory allows separating sensitivity and response bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Green &amp; Swets, 1966)</ref>, the response bias encompasses both sensory and decisional biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bang &amp; Rahnev, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rungratsameetaweemana et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Rungratsameetaweemana &amp; Serences, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Witt et al., 2015)</ref>. Similarly, some studies have attempted to map the parameters of the drift diffusion model to sensory vs. decisional effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Germar et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Voss et al., 2008)</ref>, but this mapping has been shown not to hold in all cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen &amp; Rahnev, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sánchez-Fuenzalida et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Starns et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">White &amp; Poldrack, 2014)</ref>. Some researchers have proposed that examining the distributions of confidence and RT as a function of feature strength can distinguish sensory from decisional biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gallagher et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gallagher et al., , 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Maldonado Moscoso et al., 2020)</ref>, but this conclusion has also been challenged <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chen &amp; Rahnev, 2023)</ref>. Thus, while many signatures of sensory vs.</p><p>decisional effects have been examined, clearly distinguishing between the two biases remains a challenge.</p><p>Here we take a different approach to dissociating sensory from decisional biases. First, we use a strong visual illusion (the flashed face distortion effect) that is known to lead to large sensory biases. Because the sensory bias is so large, visual illusions are an ideal test case for tracking compensation by decisional biases. Second, we track the sensory biases via a completely separate task. This approach allows us to sidestep the difficulties of using the same set of data to separately infer sensory and decisional biases. Our approach has similarities with the approach by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Sánchez-Fuenzalida et al. (2022)</ref> who also used a visual illusion to induce a large sensory bias. However, unlike us, Sánchez-Fuenzalida et al. used a reproduction task to distinguish sensory from decisional biases, and did not examine the dynamics of these biases over time.</p><p>progression of perceptual judgments. Our study indicates that repeated perceptual judgments in general may involve a decisional bias that progressively counteracts the sensory bias. While the perceptual judgments change over time, it is plausible that there is no change over time in the sensory cortex, but with changes in decisional areas in the parietal/frontal cortex. In fact, this possibility may explain previous findings where repeated visual adaptation reduced the aftereffects measured by behavioral judgments but without observing changes in the sensory cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dong et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dong et al., , 2020</ref>. More generally, our approach allows follow-up studies to map the neural correlates of sensory and decisional biases.</p><p>In summary, we find that decisional bias can progressively counteract the sensory bias over the course of a perceptual decision-making experiment. This finding highlights an ongoing and dynamic competition between these two biases, ultimately shaping the process by which individuals make perceptual decisions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Task and stimuli.
