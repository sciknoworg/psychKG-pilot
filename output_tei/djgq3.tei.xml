			<abstract>
				<p>Recent studies in the field of metacognition and decision-making have found that confidence judgments are influenced by numerous post-decisional factors. Anchoring is a post-decisional factor whose effects on decisions have been widely documented but little is known about its possible impact on decision confidence. In two experiments, participants made categorical decisions about the mean of a sequence of visual (oriented gratings) or numerical stimuli and rated their confidence on a Likert scale. By randomizing the initial location of the indicator across trials, we demonstrated the effects of anchoring in metacognitive confidence judgments. The effect was (a) consistent across two domains of visual perception and mathematical cognition and (b) independent of informational uncertainty and task difficulty. Our findings provide new evidence for the post-decisional accounts of confidence that recognize the role of idiosyncratic, domain-general, trait-like factors (e.g. susceptibility to an anchor). Our data are inconsistent with the normative accounts that confine confidence to reflecting statistical variance (in the external state of the environment) or probability of correct choice (subjective to the agent).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>A substantial area of interest within the field of confidence judgment is the examination of the concept of 'confidence' from a metacognitive perspective and the investigation of the factors that make up and influence our subjective 'feeling of knowing' or subjective conviction about the validity of our choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kanai and Rees, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fleming et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Song et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Gaining insights into the computational intricacies of how humans utilize (or fail to utilize) available information to draw such metacognitive judgments when making decisions can provide significant insights for engineering various systems, e.g. educational <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(England and Serra, 2012)</ref>, clinical <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Redelmeier et al., 2001</ref>) and commercial <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Wu and Cheng, 2011)</ref>, to optimize human decision-making.</p><p>Numerous theoretical accounts have explained the cognitive basis of how subjective confidence is constructed (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Navajas et al., 2016</ref> for a review). The majority of these accounts assume that computation of confidence is a decisional process, performed by the same neuronal circuitry that determines the choice. One well-supported reading of these decisional accounts of confidence posits that confidence should (and does) only reflect the probability that the choice was correct <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sanders et al., 2016)</ref>. By these accounts, any factor (e.g. perceptual input, action alternative etc.) that the agent experiences after having made her choice would not affect confidence.</p><p>However, many experiments have shown that confidence is indeed affected by post-decisional factors. For example, once we have made our decision in our mind, our confidence decreases the longer we have to wait for the opportunity to announce our decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kiani and Shadlen, 2009)</ref>. Such demonstrations of post-decisional modulations of confidence present critical challenges for the normative accounts of metacognition. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tversky and Kahneman (1974)</ref> illustrated in a number of studies how people rely on various heuristic principles in an attempt to reduce the complexity of inferring probabilities into simpler quantities that guide their judgments. Importantly, these heuristics often distort confidence reports as they are based on factors outside of the distributional representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Barthelme ÃÅ and Mamassian, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Meyniel et al., 2015)</ref>. Whether the distorting impact of such heuristics on confidence extends to post-decisional computations of confidence is unknown.</p><p>One commonly observed post-decisional heuristic in decision-making is anchoring. When making an estimate of a given variable, our judgment is strongly affected if we are given an initial landmark, i.e. an anchor to start from. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tversky and Kahneman, (1974)</ref> suggested that we arrive at our estimate by starting from the anchor and drifting away, but we often fail to drift off adequately. Anchoring effects are prevalent in universal knowledge tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(McElroy and Dowd, 2007)</ref> and in probability approximations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chapman and Johnson, 1999)</ref>. In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Oppenheimer et al. (2008)</ref> showed that anchoring has loose confines and can bias judgments across modalities and dimensions, even in areas such as time estimation. Since confidence is also an estimate of a subjective state, it may be amenable to anchoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Carroll et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carroll and Petrusic, 2006</ref>. These studies showed that asking participants to first compare their confidence to an initial starting point (e.g. are you more or less confident than 5 out of 6 on a Likert scale?) significantly modulates their subsequent confidence judgments towards the anchor. As a consequence, confidence judgments were affected by random starting points assigned by the experimenter rather than exclusively and accurately reflecting the participant's subjective sense of uncertainty.</p><p>As a post-decisional prime that affects confidence, the anchoring effect offers a unique opportunity to empirically challenge the normative, decisional accounts of confidence by asking several questions about the nature of computations of confidence. Previous studies have found consistent individual differences in the way people communicate their inner sense of confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ais et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">de Gardelle and Mamassian, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fleming et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Graziano and Sigman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zylberberg et al., 2014)</ref>. Despite inter-individual differences in the way stimulus variability affected performance accuracy and confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Zylberberg et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">de Gardelle and Mamassian, 2015)</ref>, the mean and shape of the confidence distribution, as well as confidence judgments' correlation with performance were constant across individuals in these studies (de Gardelle and Mamassian, 2015; <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Fleming et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>These studies show that subjects consistently tracked the mean and variance of different distributions in a similar fashion, in what appears to be an idiosyncratic manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ais et al., 2016)</ref>. Here, employing the anchoring effect, we asked if the effects of anchoring on confidence are similarly idiosyncratic. We designed two experimental tasks to study confidence judgments under conditions of varying uncertainty. On two different testing days, each participant performed either the cognitive or the perceptual experiment. In both experiments, participants made a choice and expressed their confidence in repeated trials. The initial starting point of the confidence scale was randomized across trials to enable measuring the anchoring of metacognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Thirty undergraduate psychology students, studying at University College London, participated in the current study (22 female and 8 male, age range: 19-22 years, mean: 20.54 years, SD: 0.88). Signed informed consent was obtained from all participants before completing the study. All participants had normal or corrected to normal vision and had no history of neurological or psychiatric disease. The inclusion criteria -met by all participants was being right-handed and having no history of dyscalculia or epilepsy. The experiment was conducted over two sessions that took place on two different days and all subjects were compensated ¬£30 upon completion of the second session. This study was approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Display</head><p>Stimuli and tasks were programmed in MATLAB version 8.0 (MathWorks) using the Cogent 2000 toolbox (http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent.php). The tasks were displayed on a 21inch LCD display monitor at a 1024 √ó 768 pixels resolution and a viewing distance of around 60 cm with the display refreshing at a 60 Hz rate.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli and procedure</head><p>Each participant completed two experimental sessions -each on a different day-visual and arithmetic, in a randomized order, with each session lasting around 90 minutes. 'smaller' or 'greater' was then presented and the participant had to choose by pressing either 'q' which corresponded to the choice presented on the left side of the screen or 'p' which corresponded to the choice presented on the right side. The participant was then presented with a scale ranging from 1 to 6 and asked to rate how confident she was about her answer. The inter-trial interval was between 0.7-0.9 seconds. (C) Probability distributions: the stimuli in both tasks were sampled from uniform distributions U(m-v,m+v) where parameters m=+-3 and v=10,14,24,45. (D) Confidence scale: participants were presented with a scale ranging from 1 to 6 and were asked to rate how confident they were about the initial choice. Top left panel: Example of an initial starting point of '2' and a final confidence decision of '3'. Top right panel: Example of an initial starting point of '6' and a final confidence of '4'. (Bottom). The starting point changed its position randomly on each trial.</p><p>The visual task consisted of visual displays composed of 30 serially presented Gabor patches that appeared one at a time at the fixation point with a changing orientation, either clockwise or counter clockwise <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1A</ref>).</p><p>Participants were asked to report whether the mean orientation of the 30 Gabor patches was tilted clockwise or counter-clockwise relative to the vertical meridian.</p><p>In the arithmetic task, participants were asked to decide whether the average of a sequence of numbers was greater or smaller than 50 ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1B)</ref>.</p><p>Each trial consisted of 30 two-digit numbers flashed consecutively at 4 Hz (stimulus duration: 200 milliseconds, inter-stimulus interval: 50 milliseconds), and were presented at a fixation point in the center of the screen. The arrangement and display of stimuli for the perceptual, or orientation discrimination, and the arithmetic tasks were identical with the exception of substituting Gabor patches for digits.</p><p>The words 'smaller' or 'greater' for the cognitive task, and '/' or '\' for the perceptual task were then presented on the two sides of the screen and the participant had to choose one option by pressing either the 'q' key on the keyboard corresponding to the word presented on the left side of the screen, or the 'p' key, corresponding to the choice presented on the right side. The location of the two choices changed randomly from one trial to the next and the colors of the number alternated between black and white within each trial, so as to avoid any habituation effects. Participants were presented with a scale ranging from 1 to 6 and asked to rate how confident they were about their answer. Participants used the same two keys to navigate up and down the scale and then pressed 'space bar' on the keyboard to confirm their response and move to the next trial. The starting point of the indicator on the confidence scale changed position randomly across trials. The inter-trial interval lasted between 0.7-0.9 seconds. Following every block of 20 trials, feedback was provided about the number of correct decisions in that block.</p><p>Each block had an equal number of trials from each variance condition presented in random order.</p><p>Participants reported confidence on a Likert scale (Likert, 1932) by clicking one of two keys on the keyboard ('q' or 'p') to move up or down the values from 1-6 along a horizontal line, which spanned the range from completely unsure on the left to absolute certainty on the right <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1D</ref>).</p><p>Subjects were explicitly asked to use the full range of the scale.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental conditions</head><p>On each trial, items were sampled from uniform distributions with mean m and four possible variances (defined by the support endpoints m¬±v). In the visual task, the mean m could either be +3 or -3 degrees and the parameter v could either be 10, 14, 24, or 45 degrees <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 1C</ref>). In the numerical task, the mean m could either be 47 or 53, and the parameter v could either be 7, 9, 11, and 33. These parameters were selected through pilot experiments to yield similar performances across both tasks. The distributions were pseudorandomly sampled to ensure that the mean on each trial was exactly m. Half of the participants performed the visual task first.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data analysis</head><p>To analyze the data, we used Matlab R2010 (function rm_anova2 by Schurger from the Matlab Central File Exchange). Confidence ratings were analyzed using a two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with performance, starting points, and variance levels as the within-subject variables. This analysis was performed separately for each session (cognitive versus perceptual).</p><p>The anchoring effect was measured by calculating the distance between the final confidence value and the initial starting point of the cursor. We calculated the anchoring measure by fitting an ordinal logistic regression (confidence as a function of variance and starting point). The slope represents the anchoring effect with a steeper slope indicating a stronger anchoring effect. The slope is calculated using the following ordinal logistic regression equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( &gt; ) = ! + ! + ! + ,</formula><p>with 1 ‚â§ &lt; 6, denoting confidence, V denoting variance, Sp denoting starting point, ! are intercepts, and Œµ as the error term. According to this equation ‚Ä≤ 1 ‚Ä≤ represents the variance effect and ‚Ä≤ 2 ‚Ä≤ represents the anchoring effect. In this model, both the dependent variable (C) and the independent variables (Sp and V) are ordinal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We observed a significant main effect of variance level on subjects' performance accuracy. Accuracy was higher in low-compared to highvariance conditions ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 2A, C)</ref>. This effect was present both in the perceptual (F (3, 29)= 92.3, p &lt; .001; <ref type="figure">Fig. 2A</ref>) and the cognitive tasks (F (3, 29)= 147.8, p &lt; .001; <ref type="figure">Fig.2C</ref>). There was a similar effect of variance level on confidence ratings; confidence ratings were significantly higher in lowvariance trials as compared to high-variance trials <ref type="figure">(Fig. 2B, D)</ref>. This effect was observed in both the perceptual (F (3, 29)= 41.07, p &lt; .01; <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>) and the cognitive tasks (F (3, 29)= 50.7, p &lt; .01; <ref type="figure">Figure 2D</ref>). These findings show that our experimental manipulations were successful in producing different levels of accuracy and confidence across different variance conditions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Anchoring of Confidence</head><p>Next, we tested our main hypothesis by looking at whether the arbitrary starting point on the confidence scale had an effect on confidence. Trials with a larger starting point were reported with higher confidence <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3)</ref>. This effect was present in both the perceptual (F (5, 29)= 13,84, p &lt; .001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3A</ref>) There was no significant interaction effect between the variance level and starting point in either the perceptual (F (15, 29) = 1.40, p= 0.14) or the cognitive task (F (15, 29) = 0.80, p= 0.67). This suggests that the effect of the starting point was independent of the difficulty level of the trial. We will come back to this point in the discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Quantifying the anchoring effect</head><p>Our findings show that the starting point in the confidence scale, which was randomly chosen across trials in our tasks, serves as an anchor for confidence. To quantify this anchoring effect and examine differences between individuals, we used a multivariate ordinal regression (see Methods).</p><p>We first asked if the anchoring effect was statistically different from zero in our</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A B</head><p>population. We measured the regression slope for each subject (Œ± 2 , see Methods) and found that they were significantly larger than zero in both the perceptual (t(29)= 2.9, p&lt; 0.001) and cognitive tasks (t(29)= 3.9, p= 0.007).</p><p>Next, we focused on the effect of variance on anchoring. In principle, the reliance on anchors could differ across conditions with varying levels of difficulty. To test this, we measured the anchoring effect for each variance condition separately, but we found no effect of variance, in either the perceptual (F (3,29)= 1.26, p= 0.29) or the cognitive task (F (3,29)= 0.8, p= 0.49; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4A</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stability and individual differences</head><p>We first looked at the stability of the anchoring effect within each task.</p><p>We measured the anchoring effect in the first and second halves of each experimental session and then measured the correlation between the two effects obtained from data from each half-session. We observed that these measures were consistently correlated for both the perceptual (r= 0.44 n= 30, p= 0.01) and the cognitive tasks (r= 0.60 n= 30, p&lt; 0.001). This indicates that the anchoring effect was stable over time and idiosyncratic within each task.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether the anchoring effect observed in one task was informative of the anchoring effect observed in the other task, we observed that, indeed, anchoring was consistent across tasks (r= 0.74 n= 30, p= 0.001 <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Fig. 4B</ref>). This suggests that the impact of anchors in metacognition is a domain-general property of confidence that is stable across the visual and numerical domain. ----</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We set out to examine the impact of anchoring on decision confidence.</p><p>We conducted two experiments in which participants made categorical decisions in the visual and numerical domains and reported their confidence.</p><p>We manipulated anchoring by varying the starting point of the confidence marker on the Likert scale. We found that overall, confidence reports reflected performance accuracy and, more importantly, confidence was consistently anchored by starting points. Furthermore, the anchoring effect was robust because it was both independent of uncertainty and idiosyncratic in nature.</p><p>Within each participant, the anchoring effect was stable across time and across two different task domains.</p><p>Our findings show that anchoring is observed in the metacognitive process of confidence judgment, specifically in people's subjective reports of their 'feeling of knowing' in choices across perceptual (visual) and cognitive (numerical) domains. They point to an important idiosyncratic bias that was not previously reported in the literature. Previous research in anchoring mainly focused on anchoring choices themselves rather than the agent's confidence estimates in those choices. This marks an important difference between our findings and earlier works showing that susceptibility of choices to anchoring was a function of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jacowitz and Kahneman, 1995)</ref>.</p><p>The idiosyncratic nature of the observed anchoring effect suggests that the impact of the anchor cannot be explained away as external noise. Thus, we consider a number of alternative explanations. On the one hand, anchoring could be due to laziness. One might euphemistically call this an "effort-reducing" heuristic. When a lazy participant is given a starting point of 5 on a scale of 1 to 6 and his subjective confidence is 2, pure laziness may bring him to a stop at 3, not adjusting enough <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974</ref>).</p><p>On the other hand, anchoring may arise from the uncertain nature of the decisions and the participant's desire to combine any available (external) cues -such as an anchor -in reporting her confidence. Simple integration of the "post-cue" anchor with the task-related information could lead to anchoring of confidence <ref type="bibr">Strack 1999, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Strack &amp; Mussweiler, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>However, the more sophisticated versions of cue integration models posit that each cue is weighted by its variance such that increasing the variance in one type of information would increase the contribution of the other cues to the choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Deneve, Latham, &amp; Pouget, 2001</ref>). This view would predict stronger anchoring with increasing uncertainty in high variance conditions, which is inconsistent with our data.</p><p>Our findings are inconsistent with the previously proposed view that self-monitoring is immune to anchoring effects. Proponents of this view claim that our judgments of ourselves are based on extensive, ordered information and that individuals tend to prefer information that is congruent with their selfperception <ref type="bibr">(Quattrone et al., 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>. Since confidence judgments are conspicuously self-evaluative, a strong reading of these previous works would be inconsistent with our data. However, there is an important distinction to be made between confidence in one's self and confidence in a specific judgment. Thus, one can argue that the confidence probed in our experiments has a transient, state-like quality that separates it from the more stable, trait-like self-evaluations that those previous studies might have been referring to.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conceptualization of debiasing influences that depend on first breaking</head><p>down the psychological mechanisms underlying a bias and then designing a counteractive plan to offset these mechanisms is an effective way of improving human judgment <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lord, Lepper, &amp; Preston, 1984)</ref>. The 'consider-</p><p>the-opposite' strategy has been effective in reducing overconfidence in the accuracy of one's performance by making contradictory evidence more salient <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Griffin, Dunning, &amp; Ross, 1990)</ref>. Future studies are needed to investigate whether this, or other strategies, is effective in attenuating anchoring effects in metacognitive judgments of confidence. However, the knowledge that anchoring does indeed affect metacognition is useful in and of itself, because it can be used to mitigate introduction of unintentional biases when constructing future instruments.</p><p>In summary, this study presents evidence for how our sense of confidence can be distorted by external factors that interfere with postdecisional processing and how such a tendency is intrinsic to behavior regardless of task domain or the level of uncertainty. Research on individual difference in confidence reporting has identified various heuristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Merkle, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baranski &amp; Petrusic, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zylberberg et al. 2014</ref> The table shows the actual numerical values for figure 3(A). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>We deconstructed this question to several components: (a) is anchoring of confidence reports stable and predictable across time within each participant? (b) Is such anchoring effect domain-specific or rather, traitlike and domain-general across perceptual and cognitive modalities? In other words, is a given participant's vulnerability to anchoring of confidence in a visual perceptual task predictive of anchoring when she is making numerical (arithmetic) judgments? Finally, (c) does the magnitude of anchoring depend on informational uncertainty and task difficulty? This latter question is particularly important for the normative accounts of confidence (see Discussion).</figDesc></figure>
