			<abstract>
				<p>Quantitative judgments have been suggested to result from a mixture of similarity-and rule-based processing. People can judge an object&apos;s criterion value based on the object&apos;s similarity to previously experienced exemplars and based on a rule that integrates the object&apos;s cues like a linear regression. In order to better understand these processes, the present work combines cognitive modeling and eye tracking and tests whether people who rely more on the similarity to exemplars also look more at the exemplar locations on the screen. In two eye tracking studies, participants learned to assign each of four exemplars to a different screen corner and criterion value and then judged the criterion value of briefly presented test stimuli. Eye tracking measured participants&apos; gazes to the now empty exemplar locations (a phenomenon called looking-at-nothing); cognitive modeling of the test phase judgments quantified participants&apos; reliance on a similarity-over a rule-based process. Participants showed more similarity usage and more looking-at-nothing in the study in which the cues were linked to the criterion by a multiplicative function than in the study with an additive cue-criterion link. Focusing on the study with a multiplicative environment, participants relying more on the similarity to exemplars also showed more looking-at-nothing (τ = 0.25, p = .01). Within trials, looking-at-nothing was usually directed at the one exemplar that was most similar to the test stimulus. These results show that a multi-method approach combining process tracing and cognitive modeling can provide mutually supportive insights into the processes underlying higher-order cognition.</p>

The more the mind relies on similarity over rules, the more it relies on exemplar retrieval from memory.

Accordingly, when people retrieve an exemplar from memory, they tend to fixate the spatial location that the exemplar occupied during encoding (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Scholz et al., 2015)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview and Research Aim</head><p>The present work extends the previous findings by adding cognitive modeling to test if looking-at-nothing can distinguish similarity-from rule-based processing. Specifically, we test if parameter α reflecting a participant's reliance on a similarity process in cognitive modeling correlates with the gaze proportions to the blank exemplar locations.</p><p>Additionally, we investigate the properties of such looking-at-nothing, analyzing at what time in a trial it occurs, the number of exemplars looked at per trial, and their similarity to the object being judged. To this end, we ran two eye tracking studies using a multiple-cue judgment task. Participants learned the criterion values and screen locations of four exemplars in a training phase with feedback and then judged the criterion value of briefly presented test stimuli without feedback. One study defined the criterion by a linear, additive function; the other study by the non-linear, multiplicative function of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>.</p><p>Much more looking-at-nothing was observed in the multiplicative environment than in the additive environment. This is consistent with our predictions, as multiplicative environments tend to be associated with similarity usage and additive environments with rule usage <ref type="bibr">(Juslin et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Karlsson et al., 2007</ref>). Yet, the low looking-at-nothing rates in the additive environment limit its informative value. Therefore, we report the findings from the additive environment in Appendix B and the findings from the multiplicative environment with substantial looking-at-nothing below in the main text.</p></div>

This led to a final sample of N = 48 participants (31 women; age: M ± SD = 26 ± 8 years). Assuming a type I error of .05 and a power of .95, N = 48 allows to detect a correlation of ρ = .49 between looking-at-nothing and parameter α from Eq. 1, as a sensitivity power analysis for a two-sided bivariate correlation revealed 2 . The experiment took on average about 1 hour and was approved by the ethics board of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences of the University of Zurich.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus</head><p>The experiment was programmed in Expyriment (Krause &amp; Lindemann, 2014) using Python 2.7 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Van Rossum &amp; Drake Jr, 1995)</ref>.

One cue was a rectangle containing 1 to 4 dots, the other cue was a circle containing 1 to 4 lines. The two cues were presented side by side on the screen; one cue was presented in green, and the other in purple (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 2 for examples)</ref>. The cue-color association and the cue-side association within stimuli were randomized across participants.</p><p>Each of the four exemplars was assigned to one screen corner, with a randomized stimulus-corner association across participants.

Each exemplar had a size of 6.39°× 3.69°of visual angle (320 × 180 pixels). For the gaze analyses, we drew four rectangular areas of interest (AOIs) around the exemplar locations and one around the center of the screen where the test stimuli were presented. Each AOI had a size of 7.67°× 4.43°of visual angle (384 × 216 pixels). The size of the AOI exceeded the outer borders of each stimulus rectangle by a factor of 0.1, equaling 0.64°of visual angle (32 pixels) on the x-axis and 0.37°(18 pixels) on the y-axis).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants' task was to judge the criterion values of stimuli on a scale from 1 to 30. Participants completed a training phase in which they learned the location and criterion value of four exemplars and a test phase in which they judged the criterion value of all 16 possible stimuli. In the test phase, the stimuli were only briefly presented, and we measured looking-at-nothing after stimulus removal by recording participants' eye movements to the four corners of the screen associated with the exemplars in the training phase. The resulting experimental procedure is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 2</ref> and detailed below.</p><p>In the location training phase (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 2a</ref> Preprint for a manuscript currently under revision at Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review. This preprint will be replaced by the final version in winter 2024. Please check PsyArXiv and cite the latest version.   Then the locations turned to gray rectangles, and participants indicated for one stimulus after another the correct location by clicking on the associated rectangle. If a stimulus was a distractor, participants should click on an "unknown" button in the lower part of the screen. Location training ended after participants answered all stimuli correctly in three consecutive blocks or after 15 blocks.</p><p>In the criterion training phase (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 2b</ref>), participants learned to assign the four exemplars to their criterion values. The four stimuli were presented in random order within each block for a maximum of 10 blocks or until participants answered all four stimuli correctly in three blocks. In each trial, participants studied one exemplar in its associated</p><p>Preprint for a manuscript currently under revision at Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review.

Then, they pressed the left mouse button and reached a scale ranging from 1 to 30 on which they entered their numeric judgment within 2 s. A correct response was highlighted in green; an incorrect response was highlighted in red together with the correct value highlighted in green. Additionally, verbal feedback was presented below.</p><p>In the critical criterion test phase (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 2c</ref>), participants judged the criterion value of all 16 possible stimuli in eight blocks (128 trials), with random order within blocks. In each trial, participants saw a briefly presented test stimulus in the middle of the screen and the four gray rectangles representing the locations of the exemplars, which remained visible after the test stimulus was removed from the screen. After the test stimulus removal, eye tracking measured participants' gaze durations to the blank exemplar locations until they pressed the left mouse button (without a time limit).</p><p>Participants then entered their judgment on the response scale within 2 s and got no feedback. The stimulus presentation time was individually calibrated at the beginning of the experiment in a psychophysics test, following a step-wise procedure recommended by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">García-Pérez (1998)</ref>: In each trial of the psychophysics test, the participants saw a stimulus in the middle of the screen for a certain duration. Afterwards, four comparison stimuli were each presented in a corner of the screen, and the participants indicated which one corresponded to the original stimulus. The three non-matching alternatives were selected randomly, subject to the constraint that two of them matched the original stimulus in one cue each. The presentation duration started with 2000 ms and was decreased by 336.60 ms after four correct answers in a row and increased by 400 ms after a mistake (a 4-down-1-up staircase method). All 16 stimuli were shown with random order in three blocks (48 trials), and the mean across blocks yielded the stimulus presentation time in the test phase (M = 412 ms and SD = 220 ms across participants).</p><p>At the end of the experiment, a location test was conducted to check if the participants were still able to recall the exemplar locations. The location test had the same Preprint for a manuscript currently under revision at Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review. This preprint will be replaced by the final version in winter 2024.

Location accuracy and criterion accuracy were related, τ = .35, p = .002.

Furthermore, looking-at-nothing is associated with a higher exemplar accuracy after training, τ = .34, p &lt; .001 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>).

The association was particularly pronounced for the 32 participants who weakly relied on a rule or similarity (.1 &lt; α &lt; .9), τ = 0.43, p &lt; .001, with a drop in looking-at-nothing among the participants with α &gt; .9.</p><p>On the one hand, this might suggest a non-linear relationship between α and looking-at-nothing: Participants who strongly rely on similarity might have encoded the exemplars in a particularly robust way and no longer need to look at their locations during retrieval.

Such a single-cue strategy no longer requires retrieving complete exemplars, but only the combination of a cue value and the criterion value, relaxing the Preprint for a manuscript currently under revision at Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review.

Across all stimuli, however, the cognitive process used was not associated with the judgment accuracy: The correlation between α and the mean absolute judgment error is τ = 0.10, p = .31, and the mean absolute judgment error does not differ among rules users (1.71) and similarity users (1.89), W = 178, p = .09. Note. Rule users are defined by α &lt; .5; similarity users by α &gt; .5.

Similarity users showed more looking-at-nothing than rule users for exemplars whose city-block distance from the test stimulus was lower than 1 (M similarity = 11% &gt; M rule = 4%, W = 144.5, p = .02) but not for exemplars with a city-block distance larger than 1 (M similarity = 4% ≈ M rule = 2%, W = 194.5, p = .18). Thus, the similarity users particularly focused on exemplars similar to the test stimulus. This finding is corroborated by the so-called looking-at-nothing strength (i.e., the gaze duration to the most similar exemplar divided by the summed gaze duration to all exemplar locations): The looking-at-nothing strength is larger for the similarity users (M = 34%) than for the rule users (M = 13%), W = 137.5, p = .01 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 2</ref>), and positively correlates with α, τ = .33, p = .001 (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>).</p><p>Finally, panel (c) shows that looking-at-nothing was present in M = 55% of trials among the similarity users, but only in M = 31% of trials among the rule users, χ 2 (1) = 338.74, p &lt; .001.

Even when participants looked at multiple exemplar locations within trials, most looking-at-nothing time was directed at a single location (M = 66%, SD = 15 percentage points) which belonged to the most similar exemplar in M = 48% of the trials (M similarity = 53% &gt; M rule = 41%, χ 2 (1) = 10.21, p = .001). Accordingly, the number of exemplar locations looked at was only weakly related to the reaction time, τ = .07, p &lt; .001, with every additional location increasing the reaction time by about 23 ms, t = 5.7, p &lt; .001.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>This work used a multi-methodological approach to investigate the cognitive processes involved when people infer an object's unknown criterion from its cues.</p><p>Analyzing process and behavioral data from a multiple-cue judgment task, we found a clear correspondence between the results obtained from cognitive modeling and eye tracking:</p><p>The more cognitive modeling indicated reliance on the similarity to exemplars, the more participants looked at the blank locations where the exemplars were previously encoded (looking-at-nothing, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Scholz et al., 2015)</ref>. Further analyses showed that looking-at-nothing peaked halfway through a trial, increased for exemplars more similar to the test stimulus being judged, and focused mostly one exemplar per trial.</p><p>The overall relatively low levels of looking-at-nothing in this study may have methodological reasons: First, looking-at-nothing occurs more often when the stimuli are content-rich and concrete rather than abstract (e.g., job application profiles instead of geometrical figures) and when the test stimuli are presented in an auditory way <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Rosner et al., 2022)</ref>. The sequential presentation of the test stimuli's cues takes much encoding time and increases the fixation proportions for all exemplar locations. Second, other studies maximized exemplar recall by instructing a corresponding strategy (in contrast to the present studies), thus also boosting looking-at-nothing <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Scholz et al., 2015)</ref>.

(2022, Exp. 1b)</ref>, who removed visually presented, conceptual test stimuli after 1.5 s.</p><p>Comparing the two studies, we found substantially more looking-at-nothing and more similarity usage in the multiplicative environment reported in the main text than in the additive environment reported in Appendix B. This is consistent with a cognitive perspective: Additive environments can be perfectly learned by rule-based processes (which assume an additive relation between cues and criterion, see App. A) but not by similarity-based processes. Accordingly, the human mind has a strong inclination to use a rule in an additive environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hoffmann et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Juslin et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Karlsson et al., 2007)</ref> and may therefore display little looking-at-nothing <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Scholz et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>While relying on the similarity to exemplars seems to be clearly associated with looking back at the blank exemplar locations, the present work reported only correlational evidence. The causal direction thus remains unclear: Previous research has shown that inducing either a rule or a similarity process affects looking-at-nothing accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Scholz et al., 2015)</ref>; however, more looking-at-nothing might also lead to more exemplar retrieval and similarity usage. Future research could test this hypothesis by experimentally manipulating people's eye movements to the blank exemplar locations.</p><p>Furthermore, while our application of cognitive modeling filled a gap in previous literature on looking-at-nothing and exemplar retrieval, the frequentist modeling framework we used can bias α towards the rule process in the presence of much noise <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bröder et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Izydorczyk &amp; Bröder, 2022)</ref>. We accepted this as we focused on the association between α and looking-at-nothing, which remains unaffected by linear transformations in the α estimates. Also, parameter α was well recovered in our task even in the presence of noise (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure A1)</ref>, further corroborating the validity of our approach.</p><p>Zooming out, our results suggest that cognitive modeling and process tracing provide mutually supportive insights into the processes underlying higher-order cognition.</p><p>Preprint for a manuscript currently under revision at Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review.

One avenue for future research could be to broaden up the multi-method approach of this paper by comparing multiple process tracing methods with cognitive modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We found that the process people rely on according to cognitive modeling to make inferences is reflected in their eye movements.

To test whether α was recoverable in our experimental task, we simulated multiple-cue judgments based on various parameter value combinations and checked to what extent the estimated α values when fitting the models correspond to those used to simulate the data. Specifically, in each out of 500 iterations, we randomly sampled a parameter value combination from uniform distributions (excluding α and constraining −10 ≤ β 0 ≤ 10, 0 ≤ β n ≤ 10 for n ∈ {1, 2}, and 0 ≤ σ ≤ 10). The sampled parameter value combination was used to make predictions for the similarity-and rule-based processes as per Eqs. A1 and A3. Then, for each α level from 0 to 1 in steps of .1, the combined predictionĉ i was computed and used to simulate noisy responses R i ∼ N (ĉ i , σ) for all 16</p><p>stimuli i repeated eight times as in the actual experiments.

An α of .5 (denoting equal reliance on the similarity-and rule-based processes) was well recovered, M = .47 across iterations, and a stronger reliance on one process was almost perfectly recovered in a qualitative way: The true and estimated values of α diverged from .5 in the same direction in 93% of cases.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">Note, that there exists no direct power analysis for Kendall's τ; we therefore ran the analysis for the related rank correlation coefficient (Spearman's ρ). Smaller observed correlations indicate a lack of power.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="3">Each fold used 15 of the 16 stimuli for parameter estimation (120 trials per participant) and the remaining stimulus for out-of-sample prediction (8 trials).</note>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">The α estimates are not perfectly 1 because the four participants deviated from this single-cue strategy in M = 1% of the trials.</note>
