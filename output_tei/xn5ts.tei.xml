<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction -Motivation</head> <ref type="bibr">Kahneman (2011, p. 300)</ref> <p>has suggested that "the concept of loss aversion is certainly the most significant contribution of psychology to behavioural economics". In <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kahneman and Tversky (1979)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tversky and Kahneman (1992)</ref>, loss aversion was introduced as a trait-like characteristic that impacts all decisions under risk of a person. A possible explanation for this could be related to a general bias of people against negative results. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Rozin &amp; Royzmann (2001)</ref> hypothesized that through mechanisms involving both innate predispositions and accumulation of negative experiences, individuals appraise negative events more strongly than positive ones. Other theories attribute loss aversion to emotions around ownership or a status quo bias (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Mrkva et al, 2020)</ref>. Whatever the case may be, in economic models loss aversion is often considered as being "hardwired" in people's behaviour, though this does not necessarily imply that contextual factors do not affect it. In <ref type="bibr">Kahneman and</ref> Tversky's Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) a critical role for loss aversion is played by the reference point relatively to which gains and losses are defined. Reference points are typically thought to be context specific. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Tversky and Kahneman (1991)</ref> have suggested that "although the reference point usually corresponds to the decision maker's current position it can also be influenced by aspirations, expectations, norms, and social comparisons."</p><p>A contrasting view suggests that the observed loss aversion is not only affected but to large degree it originates in contextual factors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Gal &amp; Rucker (2018)</ref> questioned whether loss aversion is a universal principle and in models of "Decision by Sampling" (DbS) the shape of the choice function and, hence, also the revealed loss aversion is predicted to change with the context within which a decision is taken <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Stewart, Reimers &amp; Harris, 2015)</ref>. Empirical research on loss aversion is not very conclusive in this respect. Structural models of CPT have proven difficult to estimate because they contain a multiplicity of structural parameters in a highly non-linear setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Harrison and Swarthout, 2023)</ref>. As a result, the stability of the estimated loss aversion is difficult to judge. <ref type="bibr">Ert &amp; Erev (2013)</ref> found that loss aversion is highly sensitive to the context in which a decision is made. Similarly, in their survey of previous empirical studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Walasek et al. (2024)</ref> concluded that loss aversion was only observable in specific frameworks and driven by contextual features of the task at hand. Experimental work tended to confirm that experimental conditions have a systematic impact on the estimated loss aversion of empirical CPT models <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Stewart et al, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">, Walasek &amp; Stewart, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">, Rakow et al., 2020</ref>. However, given the complexity of the empirical CPT models that this research was confronted with, the robustness of the results of this research has been questioned on the grounds the estimated loss aversion parameters were sensitive to (mis)specifications of the underlying subjective choice/utility model and the estimates were derived from different sets of lottery problems for different participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alempaki et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">, Andr√© &amp; De Langhe, 2021a</ref><ref type="bibr">,b, Walasek &amp; Stewart, 2021</ref>.</p><p>The experiment and empirical results presented in this paper lend support to the suggestion that loss aversion is affected by contextual factors. The experiment, which is described in more detail below, is rather straightforward. Participants recruited via the King's College London 'Research Participation System' were asked whether they would accept or reject a series of hypothetical lotteries chosen and randomly mixed from two categories. The common gambles were -as the name suggests -common to all participants. The decoy gambles differed for two groups of participants in the skewness of both gains and losses. In the initial non-parametric analysis, the skewness in the returns of decoys is found to have systematically influenced choices made in the common gambles. This non-parametric approach does not rely on any utility specification and compares "like with like", i.e. compares the choices of the two groups of participants when facing the same set of (common) gambles. These two aspects respond to two of the main criticisms of the previously mentioned experimental work. The difference in the choices between the two groups of participants is particularly clear to see in those common gambles where gains were equal to losses ("balanced gambles"). Depending on the skewness of the decoys, the one group of participants accepted only about 27% of all such balanced gambles, while the respective acceptance rate of the other group was around 57%.</p><p>The paper then develops and estimates a choice model that may account for the observation that decoy gambles have affected the choices of the participants in the common gambles. The model extends the standard model of the CPT by introducing the idea that returns may be perceived relatively to returns of other alternatives in a choice set <ref type="bibr">(Bushong et al., 2021, Daviet and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Webb, 2023)</ref> and, in particular, relatively to returns the participants observed in the course of the experiment. Thus, lottery outcomes are weighted higher if they stand out compared to what a participant has previously observed and has in mind, including the previously encountered decoy gambles. The model draws from the "range-frequency" theory of judgment originating in the work of <ref type="bibr">Parducci and others (1965;</ref>, which is also one of the theoretical underpinnings for the DbS choice models. The resulting empirical model encompasses the standard choice model of CPT as a special case. This allows one to test for the existence of the range-frequency mechanism within the standard empirical framework of the CPT models. In line with the results of the non-parametric analysis, we find that the estimated loss sensitivity varies systematically with the skewness of the decoy gambles as predicted by the range-frequency theory. The participants that faced more decoy gambles with higher gains and lower losses behaved as if they were mildly loss averse (with an estimated loss sensitivity of around 1.2-1.3), while those facing decoys with lower gains and higher losses were statistically loss neutral. Pooling the two groups together, the mean and median estimates suggest a very mild but statistically significant loss aversion, a possible indication that some people are loss averse irrespectively of the contextual setting.</p><p>The results are robust to different estimation methods and to random variations of the samples.</p><p>The main conclusion of this paper is that a tendency of people to perceive outcomes relatively to what they have recently observed ("a sequential contrast effect") means that the revealed loss sensitivity may be context specific. This does not exclude the possibility that (at least some) people are at the same time intrinsically loss averse as suggested by CPT, though the degree of loss aversion being manifested is then dependent on the context. The outline of the rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the experiment and main non-parametric tests.</p><p>Section 3 outlines the theoretical model and section 4 derives the empirical model and tests the main hypothesis. Section 5 explores in some more detail the heterogeneity among participants and section 6 concludes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>The collection of the experimental data was included in King's College London 'Research Participation System' (SONA). Participants were mainly, but not exclusively, students of King's College. The sole eligibility criterion was a minimum age of 16. Students of the first year psychology course at the university were awarded 15-minutes worth of research credits for their participation and all participants were incentivised with an entry into a lottery. The final number of participants that completed the experiment was 130. Though information on education and demographics was not collected, it is safe to assume that the participants were on average younger and more educated than the average UK population. Each participant was given a unique ID-code with which they could access the experiment over the internet. They could pause and restart, but once the experiment was completed (or if they were logged out after a maximum period of inactivity), the participant could not access the experiment a second time. <ref type="bibr">2</ref> After reading the instructions, participants were exposed twice to a set of 64 hypothetical lotteries (in total 128). 3 Each lottery had a stated (hypothetical) gain and loss and a 50-50 chance of winning or losing. The participants were asked whether they would accept to take a gamble with such a lottery or whether they would reject it. Thus, the total number of accept/reject observations available together with the respective gains/losses is 16640 (130 participants per 128 gambles each). Unknown to the participants, they were randomly placed in one of two groups facing different experimental conditions. For the participants in the first group (A), the lotteries had a distribution of negatively skewed gains and positively skewed losses ("Gneg-Lpos"). <ref type="bibr">4</ref> Gains took values from <ref type="bibr">Gneg={1,</ref><ref type="bibr">11,</ref><ref type="bibr">19,</ref><ref type="bibr">25,</ref><ref type="bibr">29,</ref><ref type="bibr">32,</ref><ref type="bibr">34,</ref><ref type="bibr">35}.</ref> Losses took values from the set Lpos={1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 17, 25, 35}. All possible combinations of values from these two sets were included only once in the lottery set for each participant in group A, resulting to a set of 64 (8x8) gambles in random order. The same set of lotteries (in different random order) were then repeated a second time for each participant. For the second group (B), the sets of gains and losses of group A were interchanged resulting to a distribution with positively skewed gains and negatively skewed losses ("Gpos-Lneg") as depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. 2 The software 'Gorilla-experiment-builder' was used (https://gorilla.sc/). <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Between the first and second half of the 64 bets, participants were invited to pause and rest. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> The experimental designed followed that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Walasek &amp; Stewart's (2019)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">experiment. -35 Gneg-Lpos Gpos-Lneg -30 -20 -10 0 +20 +10 +30 +35</formula><p>Essential part of the experiment was that the two sets of gambles for A and B contained 32 gambles that were common for all 130 participants. These were all the combinations where both gains and losses took one of the values {1, 11, 25, 35}, so 16 (4x4) lotteries were common to everyone and were repeated twice in random order for each participant. In total, there are 4160 observations of common gambles (130 participants per 32 common gambles each). The average return of all common gambles for each participant is zero. All other gambles containing a gain and/or a loss from the set {2, 4, 7, 17} are called decoy gambles (total observations 12480). Overall, in the A group of participants ("Gneg-Lpos") there were many more decoy gambles where gains were bigger than losses and the opposite was true for B ("Gpos-Lneg") ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). From the point of view of the participants, there was no indication that the common and decoy gambles were to be treated differently.</p><p>Finally, for a subsample of 8 common gambles, gains were equal to losses. These are called below balanced gambles (Gain=Loss in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). In total, there were 1040 observations of balanced gambles (130 participants per 8 balanced gambles each).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2: Distribution of gambles in group A (Gneg-Lpos) and B (Gpos-Lneg) (percentages)</head><p>Notes: The two bars report the distribution of gambles across the two groups of participants, distinguishing whether Gains and Losses are equal or not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The choices of all participants are summarised in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. The first two bars show the percentage of common gambles accepted by groups A and B respectively, while the last two show the acceptance rates in the subsample of balanced gambles. Participants in group A accepted the common gambles 38% of the time, while those in group B approximately 50% of the time. A t-test confirms that these two acceptance rates are statistically different at 1% significance level (t(4158)=-7.9, p value = 1).</p><p>Acceptance rates could differ between persons for any number of reasons, as discussed below.</p><p>There is no reason however why these idiosyncratic characteristics of persons would systematically differ between the randomly selected participants of group A and B. Instead, what differs by design for the two groups are the decoy gambles the participants were exposed to. These results then provide prima facie evidence that decoys had an impact on how participants decided over the common lotteries. Group A faced many more decoy gambles with high gains and low losses, which would seem to have led the participants in that group to undervalue the gains and/or overvalue the losses of common gambles compared to group B.</p><p>As a result, they rejected the common lotteries more often.</p><p>This result is robust to random variations of the sample. For example, the difference in the choices of the two groups remains statistically significant if every second participant from both A and B is dropped from the sample. The same is also true if one considers only the 64 gambles from the first or from the second half of the experiment for all participants. Further, the two bars on the right in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref> show the acceptance rates of the two groups for the subsample of balanced gambles for which gain=loss. The difference in the acceptance rates of the two groups is here even larger. The acceptance rate of balance gambles by A was only 27%, while that by B was 57%. The difference between the two is again statistically significant (t <ref type="formula">1038</ref> ten. The idea of a very short "discovery phase" is supported also from the pattern of acceptance rates in the present experiment. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> shows the average acceptance rates in balanced gambles (gain=loss) in 8 sequential phases of the experiment, separately for group A and B.</p><p>Each phase contains in total 16 lotteries per participant of which one, on average, is a balance gamble in random order. On average, therefore, each phase contains 65 balanced gambles for each group. The acceptance rate of balanced gambles fell for group A from around 45% in the first phase of the experiment to an average of around 25% thereafter, with fluctuations between 10% and 30% in the phases 2 to 8. For group B it fluctuated instead around 55%. In the first phase, the two average acceptance rates were not statistically significantly different at 1% or 5% (t-test = -1.47, Pr(T &lt; t) = 0.0724). In phases 2 to 8, instead, the difference between the two acceptance rates remained strongly statistically significant. Participants seem to have adapted their choices rather early in the experiment, possibly after having observed no more than 10 (common and to depend therefore only on the gains and losses of that same gamble. In psychology, on the other hand, it is common to consider that the evaluation of a stimulus or information is made in the context and in relation to other relevant stimuli the person experienced before. This is for instance the main proposition of the range-frequency model of judgment, first proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Parducci (1965)</ref>, that underpins the Decision by Sampling models mentioned above.</p><p>Cumulative Prospect Theory goes some way in bridging this gap, but not without the introduction of some auxiliary hypotheses of how people form their reference points in the so called "editing phase" of the decision process. To see this, consider a standard model based on</p><p>Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) by <ref type="bibr">Tversky (1979, 1992)</ref>. The subjective valuation ("utility") of a 50/50 gamble with gain x and a loss y (the latter measured in absolute terms) can be written as follows, <ref type="bibr">vŒÑ, uŒÑ&gt;0, vŒÑŒÑ, uŒÑŒÑ&lt;0</ref> The loss aversion parameter Œª is usually considered to be bigger or equal than 1 and r is the reference point. The utility functions, v and u, are allowed to differ for gains and for losses. 6</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">V(x, y) = 0.5 v(x-r) -0.5 Œª u(y+r) where v(0)=u(0)=0,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Typically, they are represented by two power functions: v(x)= x Œ± and u(y)= y Œ≤ with 0&lt;Œ±, Œ≤&lt;1. 7</p><p>A person is thought to "accept" a lottery if her subjective valuation of it, V(x, y), plus a random factor (error) Œµ are higher than an arbitrary constant c. The constant c can be thought of as a person's propensity or disinclination to gamble:</p><p>(2) P = Probability of lottery being "accepted" = Probability</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">[V(x, y) + Œµ &gt; c ]</formula><p>As can be seen from (1) and <ref type="formula">2</ref> This leaves us then with the reference point, r, as a potential channel through which preceding decoys gambles may have affected choices in subsequent common gambles. The reference point differs from the other parameters of the CPT model in that it enters the value function at the early "editing phase" of decision making, before gains and losses are transformed into "utils" as can be seen in (1). It determines the relative magnitude (scale) of gains and losses measured by the distance from the reference point rather than from zero. This introduces a subjective element in the scaling/measurement of the initial information of relevance to a choice.</p><p>The conceptual origins and properties of the reference point remain somewhat elusive, but for the most part this is thought to reflect the "status quo" (the decision maker's "current position") against which a person compares all new information <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Barberis, 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Baillon et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">, Harrison and Swarthout, 2023</ref>. In the context of the hypothetical lotteries examined here,</p><p>where there is no change in the "current position" of a participant brought about by the experiment, the relevant status quo for each participant would be one established before the start of the experiment and therefore unrelated to the distribution of the decoys. <ref type="bibr">K√∂szegi and</ref><ref type="bibr">Rabin (2006, 2007)</ref>  In what follows, we take a somewhat different perspective to the issue of subjective scaling of gains and losses considering this as a cognitive issue of perception. A prominent line of thought with very long pedigree in psychology is based on the idea that a stimulus is judged in the context of other comparative stimuli that are either contingent in space or have preceded it in time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Birnbaum, 1974</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">, Louie et al 2013</ref>. The relevant comparative stimuli shape the context or frame of reference within which a stimulus is perceived and understood. This typically applies to our perceptions of, say, distance or size, but Bushong at al (2021) list a number of cases where such "relative thinking" applies to economic decisions as well. One example of relative thinking of particular relevance to recurring events is the "sequential contrast effect"</p><p>whereby a quantity appears larger if a previously encountered quantity is smaller and vice versa <ref type="bibr">(Enke 2024, Radbuch and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Schiprowski, 2024)</ref>. To fix ideas of how this may have worked in the experiment, consider the range-frequency model of Padruzzi (1965), mentioned earlier, applied to perceptions. The proposition is that the perception of an external stimulus x depends on the position of x within the range of the relevant comparison set Zx (R(Zx)) and on the rank of x (F(Zx)) within the set of data in Zx.</p><p>Intuitively, the range effect means that, for example, a gain of 10 looks subjectively higher if the maximum gain a person has in mind for this game is 11 and the minimum is 0, while it looks lower if the maximum is 20 and the minimum is 9. Our perceptions of a given gain depend on its position in the max-min interval of our comparison set and the same holds for the range effect of losses R(Zy). 9 The rank or frequency component implies that, if the comparison set Zx has a constant range from 2 to 12, then a gain of 4 will seem smaller if the bulk of the comparable gains is concentrated between 9 and 12 as opposed to the case that it is concentrated between 2 and 5. <ref type="bibr">10</ref> In general the frequency effect will depend on the distance of the gain or loss from the mode of the comparison sets. Combining the range and rank or frequency effects with weights w and (1-w) respectively, one can then derive an overall (subjective) scaling factor, W( ). 11</p><p>(3) W(Zx) = w R(Zx) + (1-w) F(Zx)</p><p>Thus, one subjectively perceives a gain of x as xW(Zx), with the scaling factor W(Zx) in <ref type="formula">3</ref>taking values between 0 and 1. To be sure, the above does not mean that a rational person can be fooled to believe that a gain of 3 is bigger than one of 4 because of a certain comparison set.</p><p>The scaling factors W() determine the perceptions of relative gains and losses in the context of a specific gamble. It hypothesizes that, when making choices, people do not only compare 11 The weights, w and (1-w) in (3) are typically thought to be around 0.5, though <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bhui and Gershman (2018)</ref> suggest that the range component may receive a higher weight if the ranking is difficult, for example in the case where the values of Zx need to be recalled from memory. absolute gains and losses, but also gains and losses that are normalised by previously encountered values.</p><p>The form of the scaling relation W( ) is not defined here more precisely other than to hypothesize that it is the same for gains and losses and it follows the logic of the rangefrequency model. This is akin to what recent models on salience suggest for the weighting of different attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bordalo et al. 2022)</ref>: A gain or a loss is expected to receive more attention and to "loom" bigger if it highly contrasts with previous comparative gains or losses. The subjective distance of gains and losses from the reference point can thus be written as follows.</p><p>(4) zx = x W(Zx) -r and zy = y W(Zy) + r</p><p>There is a certain parallel between the scaling factors applied in (4) and the "decision weights" discussed in the context of CPT. In both cases, people are thought to place a higher weight on rare events. Important in (4) is that the rarity of an event is explicitly defined relatively to a subjective comparison set of values that include recently experienced gains and losses. 12</p><p>Dropping the constant 0.5 for simplicity, the subjective valuation of a lottery in (1) can now be rewritten as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">(5) V(x, y) = v(zx) -Œª u(zy) = v[x W(Zx) -r] -Œª u[y W(Zy) + r]</formula><p>The proposed model above draws from the range-frequency theory, which also forms the conceptual basis for the models of "Decision by Sampling" <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Stewart et al., 2015)</ref>. There is however one important difference worth mentioning. The Decision by Sampling models have been proposed as alternatives to standard utility maximization, the idea being that the expression of the different attributes of a choice in a common metric of utility or of value is a theoretical concept that does not correspond to how people think or chose. In a clear statement in this respect, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Stewart and Simpson (2008)</ref> refuted altogether the idea that decisions are taken based on stable internal 'psychometrics' that translate outcomes into utility. In the context of the experiment in this paper, for example, a DbS model would suggest that participants make their choices comparing directly the scaling factors of gains and losses, W(Zx) and W(Zy) in</p><p>(3), without having to use a value function, V(x, y) in (5). <ref type="bibr">13</ref> As <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Stewart et al. (2015)</ref>  The model proposed here combines instead the range-frequency theory with the standard CPT into a single model. As can be seen from (5), this allows for the possibility that standard features of the CPT, such as a stable loss aversion Œª, may co-exist with context specific perceptions of outcomes as described by zx and zy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Empirical specification and hypothesis testing</head><p>For empirical purposes, a linear approximation of utility V(x, y) is much easier to work with. If L=1 a person can be said to be loss neutral in the sense that, at the point of linearization m, the marginal impact of losses on the subjective value of the lottery is the same (but of opposite sign) to that of gains. An L&gt;1 means that losses loom bigger at the margin than equivalent gains and vice versa. As is the case in CPT models, the loss sensitivity is determined by the loss aversion parameter, Œª, the shape of the utility functions for gains and losses (vŒÑ and uŒÑ) and the reference point, r (that enters as an argument in vŒÑ and uŒÑ). New in (8) are the subjective scaling factors of gains and losses W(Zx), W(Zy) that can also affect loss sensitivity by affecting the subjectively perceived relative scaling of gains and losses.</p><p>Under the null hypothesis the subjective value of a lottery is not affected by the scaling factors W(Zx) and W(Zy). This implies that the distribution of decoy gambles should not have affected the estimated loss sensitivity. The null hypothesis is what one would expect to see under the standard CPT model with predetermined reference points. An alternative hypothesis is that decoys have an impact on loss sensitivity via their effect on the scaling factors W(Zx) and W(Zy). In particular, the range-frequency model would suggest that single gains and losses are perceived bigger or smaller depending on how they contrast with the rest of the distribution of returns. Under this alternative hypothesis we would expect that the estimated loss sensitivity of participants in group A will tend to be systematically higher than for B because the first group faces relatively more decoy lotteries with high gains and small losses.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, estimates of bgain and bloss are required. As the subjective utility of a gamble, V(x, y), is not directly observable, this can be substituted out by making use of the decision rule (2). Under the hypothesis that the error term, Œµ, follows a logistic distribution, one may derive from (2) and (7) the following empirical logit model (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Maddala and Lahiri, 2009</ref>):</p><p>(9) log(P/(1-P)) = bias + bgain x + bloss y P/(1-P) are the odds of accepting a gamble (P is the probability of accepting one) and bias is a constant (equal to a-c) that can vary from one person to another. The empirical model (9) is next estimated as a panel random effects logit model. 15 <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> reports the estimates of bgain and bloss with standard errors in parentheses corrected for heteroscedasticity. The estimated loss sensitivity, L (=-bloss/bgain), is also reported (in bold) together with the probability of L&gt;1 (from a chi square test with df=1). All estimated coefficients are statistically significant at 1% and have the expected signs. The implied average marginal effects are of reasonable magnitudes. The first three columns report the estimates from common gambles, first for all participants pooled together and then separately for groups A and B. Overall participants were very mildly loss averse. The mean loss sensitivity of all participants pooled together is estimated to have been 1.12 and is statistically different than 1 at 99% significance level.</p><p>The estimates for the two groups suggest that the null hypothesis that decoys play no role is firmly rejected. The estimated loss sensitivity of group A is 1.23 while that of B is 1.04. The difference is statistically significant (Wald test with chi2(1)= 9.97 and Prob&gt;chi2=0). This is what we would have expected under the hypothesis of the range-frequency theory. Under this alternative hypothesis, participants scaled returns depending on how these compared with the overall distributions of gains and losses, including the decoy gambles. The estimates of the loss sensitivity suggest that the randomly selected participants of group A behaved as if they were mildly loss sensitive, while those in group B were loss neutral.</p><p>In columns 4 and 6 of <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, the same model is estimated using all 16,640 observations, from both common and decoy gambles. From the point of view of the participants there was no difference between the two sets of gambles. We would expect therefore that their choices were consistent in all gambles. When pooling all participants, the estimated loss sensitivity in column 4 is 1.17. This is statistically different than 1 at 99% significance level. The estimated loss sensitivity of group A is 1.28 and statistically higher than 1 with 99% probability. That of group B is 1.08 and statistically higher than 1 with 79% probability. The difference between the last two is again statistically significant (Wald test with chi2(1)= 22.2 and Prob&gt;chi2=0).</p><p>It should be further mentioned that the above results hold with random variations of the sample, for example when excluding every second participant or when splitting the sample of lotteries in two.</p><p>These results lend support to the hypothesis that the revealed loss sensitivity in the experiment was affected by the distribution of decoy lotteries, as predicted by the range-frequency theory.</p><p>At the same time, the results suggest that there is a certain asymmetry in all participants' evaluation of gains and losses, which is the hallmark of CPT. Both groups of participants were found to have a loss sensitivity close or above 1, which cannot be explained by the scaling factors alone. This could be an indication of an intrinsic loss aversion, as predicted by CPT, that goes beyond the contextual factors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Heterogeneity in loss sensitivity</head><p>The estimates of loss sensitivity in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> are based on a parsimonious panel data model. Ever since the empirical work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tversky and Kahneman (1992)</ref>, however, the method often favoured in this type of studies has been to estimate the utility function separately for each person and then calculate and test hypotheses using the medians of the estimated individual parameters. The approach of estimating the loss sensitivity separately for each participant allows for a better overview of the distribution of loss sensitivity. On the downside, the number of estimated parameters for the same overall number of observations increases and the degrees of freedom fall sharply. Estimates of individual loss sensitivity from only 32 common lotteries are therefore too unreliable. For the estimation of (9) separately for each participant all 128 common and decoy gambles have to be used. Even so, estimates of loss sensitivity could be recovered for only 57 participants of group A and 55 for group B. For the rest of the participants no estimates were available due to little variation in the data. <ref type="bibr">16</ref> As is common for this type of empirical studies, estimates from individual logistic regressions vary a lot and include what <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Harrison and Swarthout (2023)</ref> called some "wild" estimates (from an a priori perspective). The minimum estimated loss sensitivity for the participants in our experiment is 0.24 and the maximum 6.13. Having said this, 90% of the estimated values are in the range of 0.58 and 3.2, which may be considered more plausible from a priori point of view. The mean of the estimated L is 1.4 and the median 1.07, with the distribution of the estimated log(L) positively skewed (skew 0.22). The median participant is found to be very mildly loss averse.  16 With reduced degrees of freedom, there is sometimes too little variation in the data of some participants for the logistic regression to reliably separate the effects of gains and of losses. As a result, the estimation algorithm cannot converge to a single set of estimates for bgain and bloss and no estimates of loss sensitivity can be recovered for the participants in question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group A Group B</head><p>Notes: The bars report for each group the number of participants with loss sensitivities in the respective interval</p><p>The distributions of the estimated L are rather different between the two groups. That of group A is shifted and it is skewed to the right with only about 1 in 5 participants having an estimated loss sensitivity lower than 1. For group B, instead, close to half of the participants had an estimated loss sensitivity below 1. A Mann-Whitney (or rank-sum) test easily rejects the hypothesis that the two distributions could have come from the same population (z=3.38 and Prob&gt; |z| = 0). The difference is preserved even if one ignores the tails of the two distributions (where L&lt;0.5 and L&gt;2). <ref type="bibr">17</ref> The median loss sensitivity of group A is estimated to have been</p><p>17 Both tails of the distribution for group B extend further than those of group A. This could be a random result or it could be because the decoys distribution faced by group B, with positively skewed gains and negatively skewed losses, is not a common distribution in a real world gamble environment. Consequently, participants' priors may have been very different to start with and this may have led to more noisy choices. This hypothesis warrants further investigation in the future.</p><p>1.19, that of B was 1.0. A non-parametric test rejects the equality of the two with 95% confidence (Pearson chi2 (1) = 3.57, Prob= 0.059).</p><p>To summarise, despite the rather different methodologies, the results reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 5</ref> point clearly to the same conclusions. No matter which subsample of gambles one looks at (total or common), the estimated loss sensitivities of the two groups were statistically different both in means and in medians. Overall, the participants of group A tended to choose as if they were mildly loss averse. Those of B were statistically loss neutral. The estimates are consistent with the predictions of the range-frequency or the Decision by Sampling models.</p><p>Additionally, as can be seen from the lower part of <ref type="figure">Figure B</ref>, little less than half the participants of Group B are estimated to have a loss sensitivity less than 1, which would imply that at the margin they are "gain seekers" (or "loss loving"). This result is very hard to interpret within a standard CPT model if contextual factors were not playing a role.</p><p>At the same time and irrespectively of the decoy gambles, the estimated mean and median loss sensitivity was at least 1. Moreover, it is interesting to note that even in Group B, close to 1/5 one respondents had an estimated loss sensitivity of over 2 even though the distribution of the decoys they faced should have led them to overestimate gains and underestimate losses. This suggests that at least some individuals have a strong (intrinsic?) tendency to loss aversion irrespectively of the context, as is suggested by the standard CPT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>One way of summarising the results of this paper is that "recent history matters" when it comes to the loss sensitivity of persons. Using new experimental data, the evidence above suggests that the revealed loss sensitivity of participants varied with the distribution of the decoy lotteries they had observed in the course of the experiment. If confirmed in a more general context, this could have important implications in different decisions under risk, such as in financial markets with repeated trading. It would suggest for example that a previous stream of good outcomes in a financial market can lead investors to overweight and overreact to less positive outcomes, thus behaving as if they were highly loss averse ("bearish") at that point.</p><p>This could lead to sharper market "corrections" and market fluctuations than it would have been the case otherwise.</p><p>The suggested explanation for such behaviour is that, in the early "editing" phase (or "framing") of a decision process, people tend to perceive new information in in relation to similar experiences retrieved from memory. Recent comparable observations play a prominent role in this process together, possibly, with long held priors. The editing phase has mostly been considered in the context of complex choice problems for which individuals need to implement simplifying strategies (heuristics) in order to deal with their limited capacity to process information. Along similar lines, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bhui and Gershman (2018)</ref> suggest that the Decision by Sampling model and underlying range-frequency theory are efficient methods of coding a signal in a noisy channel when there are cognitive limitations. Having said this, it is also worth recalling the observation of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tversky and Simonson (1993)</ref> that "The analysis of context effects, in perception as well as in choice, provides numerous examples in which people err by complicating rather than by simplifying the task; they often perform unnecessary computations and attend irrelevant aspects of the situation under study." The range-frequency model may be an efficient method of coding in complex problems, but at the same time it could also be complicating simple decisions of the type considered in the experiment of this paper.</p><p>The chosen setting of the experiment in this paper, with purely hypothetical outcomes in 50-50 lotteries, has the advantage of limiting the possibilities of confounding factors such as endowment effects or possible miscalculations of probabilities. At the same time, this is a rather artificial setting. One concern is that the repetitive questions on simple hypothetical lotteries may have had the undesired result of some participants giving snap (default) answers putting little attentional or mnemonic effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lee and Daunizeau, 2021)</ref>. Priors could have had an important role in this case. On its own, this hypothesis would not explain why the two groups of participants made different choices. But such inattention could have resulted to increased noise in the data and possibly an overall downward bias in the estimates of loss sensitivity (given also that losses did not really bite).</p><p>To control for such "default" answers, the 20% fastest answers of each participants were removed and the model was re-estimated on the assumption that defaults speed up the responses of each participant. Without getting into details, all of the above results remained valid also with this subsample. Ultimately, however, the model suggested in this paper needs to be tested with data of additional experiments, possibly involving real stakes, as well as with case studies from real world conditions. More elaborate experiments can also clarify how and how fast individuals update their comparison sets by retrieving similar experiences from memory and what the role of any long-held priors may be.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Visual representation of the lotteries in the experimentNotes: Top panel shows the distribution with negatively skewed gains (in green) and positively skewed losses (in red) faced by group A.

This even bigger difference in the two acceptance rates is a further confirmation of the role of decoy gambles. When gains and losses in a gamble are very different (e.g. a gain of 1 and loss of 35), one may expect that the choice in a 50-50 lottery is clear-cut for all participants no matter what decoys they were exposed to. Instead, in balanced gambles with gain=loss, even a small effect of decoys on preferences could have tilted the decision one way or the other.An important characteristic of the experiment was that participants were not informed beforehand or during the experiment about the existence of two categories of lotteries (common and decoy) nor about the distribution of either. Therefore, if decoy lotteries were to have influenced the participants' choices, the participants would have needed first to experience a certain number of gamble rounds. Only then, could they have formed an idea of the underlying distribution of the decoy (and common) lotteries. Discussing a similar experiment, Steward et al. (2015) have suggested that participants could have formed an idea about the comparative distribution of gains and losses already after having seen few lotteries, possibly no more than</figDesc></figure>

A decision-making model with "sequential contrast effects" Why would the distribution of preceding decoy gambles affect the choices in subsequent common gambles? Spektor et al. (2024) argued that the accept/reject type of lottery can invite comparisons between the present lottery and the history of previously accepted/rejected lotteries. 5 But what would explain such a dependence of present choices on past lotteries, including decoy lotteries. Standard utility models, such as the expected utility model, typically predict that "bygones are bygones" if returns and probabilities are known with certainty (there are no expectations) and there are no wealth effects. Choices in one gamble would be expected</figDesc></figure>

Gains and losses from other lotteries are of no relevance in the choice of accepting or rejecting it. Turning to the parameters of the model, the propensity or disinclination to gamble, c, and the loss aversion parameters, Œª, are both considered to reflect trait-like or pre-determined, persistent characteristics of persons. In a standard CPT model, experimental conditions should not have affected these two parameters.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_8"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Given that in the experiment of this paper gains and losses are drawn from the same range of values, a natural point for the linearisation of V(x, y) is around the mid-point, m, in both the range of gains and of losses. With some simplification in the notation, V(x, y) can be approximated as follows:(6) V(x, y) ‚âà V(m, m) + vŒÑ( Zx) W(Zx) (x-m) -Œª uŒÑ( Zy) W(Zy) (y-m)where vŒÑ(Zx) stands for vŒÑ(m W(Zx)-r), the first derivative of v( ) with respect to x, evaluated at the mid-point m, and similarly for loss function uŒÑ(Zy). Collecting terms, (6) can then be written in the more familiar form: 14(7) V(x, y) ‚âà a + bgain x + bloss y Therefore, as a first order approximation, the subjective value of a lottery is a linear function of gains and losses. The coefficients bgain and bloss capture the marginal impact of gains and of losses on the subjective value of the lottery calculated at the point of linearization, m, the same point for all participants. Both the constant and the coefficients of x and y may vary from one person to another. The ratio of the two coefficients is a useful metric of a participant's loss sensitivity L: (8) Loss sensitivity L =def (-bloss/bgain) = Œª [uŒÑ(Zy) W(Zy)] / [vŒÑ(Zx) W(Zx) ]</figDesc></figure>
