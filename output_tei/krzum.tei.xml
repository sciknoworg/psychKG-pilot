<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>PROFILE PHOTO PREFERENCE 4 discrimination has also been found for other sharing economy platforms, such as Uber, Lyft, and BlaBlaCar <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Farajallah et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ge et al., 2020)</ref>, and along dimensions other than race, such as attractiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jaeger et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Peng et al., 2020)</ref> and disability status <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ameri et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> see also <ref type="bibr">Troncoso &amp; Luo, 2023)</ref>. Thus, especially sellers from racial minorities or other groups that are the frequent target of discrimination may be reluctant to display profile photos or other personal information.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Impact of Profile Photos on Consumer Choice and Trust</head><p>Sellers can choose to remove personal photos from their profile because of privacy concerns, to reduce the potential for discrimination, or for other reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dillahunt &amp; Malone, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jang, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Penman et al., 2016)</ref>. Yet, increased anonymity, and the removal of profile photos in particular, may also have negative consequences for sellers. Profile photos feature prominently on most sharing economy platforms and previous research has shown that customers rely on them to assess sellers' trustworthiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dai et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ert &amp; Fleischer, 2019)</ref>. Thus,</p><p>given that trust is crucial and given that trustworthiness judgments are based (at least in part) on a seller's photo, customers may avoid sellers who do not display a photo.</p><p>There is limited evidence on how the presence (vs. absence) of profile photos influences consumer decisions in the sharing economy. An analysis of 45,000 Airbnb hosts in the United States and China showed that hosts without a photo received lower review scores (and this difference was larger in the United States; Jang, 2023). However, guests provided review scores after staying with the host. Although some confounds were controlled for (number of bedrooms and bathrooms, property type, and price), it is plausible that the difference in review scores can be explained by other host characteristics rather than the absence of a profile photo per se (e.g., hosts who choose not to post a profile photo might also be less professional or attentive towards guests during their stay).</p><p>A study by <ref type="bibr">Teubner and colleagues (2014)</ref> tested the causal influence of profile photos more directly. Groups of participants repeatedly engaged in a resource-sharing task. Participants either saw profile photos of the other participants in their group, an avatar that somewhat resembled participants, or a simple silhouette with a letter indicating the gender of the participant. Participants were more likely to share a monetary endowment when they could see profile photos of the other players, and this was partly explained by greater levels of trust.</p><p>However, the study design was highly abstract and many cues that customers have access to in PROFILE PHOTO PREFERENCE 5 the sharing economy were not captured in the paradigm. This limitation was somewhat improved in another study in which participants viewed simplified, hypothetical Airbnb listings with varying prices, review scores, and profile photos <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fagerstrøm et al., 2017)</ref>. When no photo of the host was displayed, participants were less motivated to explore the listing and less likely to rent the apartment. Although their study design more closely captured the decision-making context of a sharing economy platform, <ref type="bibr">Fagerstrøm and colleagues (2017)</ref> used images from a face database in their study, with individuals who were instructed to show specific facial expressions, rather than naturalistic photos commonly used on sharing economy platforms. Moreover, participants saw very limited information about the listing and, crucially, no other personal information about the host that is usually visible on Airbnb and other platforms. This may inflate the effect of photo availability on booking preferences because photos were the only piece of information about the host that participants had access to.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Present Studies</head><p>Here, we investigate how the presence vs. absence of profile photos influences consumer preferences and trust in the sharing economy in four preregistered studies. We test the causal effect of removing profile photos from sharing economy listings in a series of lab experiments in which participants indicate their (hypothetical) willingness to stay with different host after viewing their profiles. We extend and improve on previous work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fagerstrøm et al., 2017)</ref> in several key ways. Crucially, we examine consumer preferences and trust using a more realistic model of the decision-making environment. We use actual profile photos and participants also have access to other information about the host (e.g., their gender, age, and a short "about me" section). We also examine the effects of profile photos in the context of another sharing economy platform that has received less attention in previous studies: Couchsurfing. Couchsurfing connects travelers with hosts who are willing to share their home at no cost and according to the website, offers a network of 12 million users across 200,000 cities worldwide (www.couchsurfing.com/). In Studies 1-3 (N = 380), we test whether people are more willing to stay with a Couchsurfing host when the host displays a profile photo with their listing. We also explore the role of trust and whether different sellers face different penalties when choosing to omit a personal photo. Specifically, we test whether the absence of a profile photo has a more negative effect for hosts who might experience a benefit from revealing their appearance (i.e., attractive PROFILE PHOTO PREFERENCE 6 hosts), compared to hosts who might experience a cost from revealing their appearance (i.e., unattractive hosts). In Study 4, we extend this work to the field by examining whether people's preference for profile photos (and the resulting greater demand for services by sellers who disclose a personal photo) is reflected in the prices of advertised rides on BlaBlaCar (n = 461), a long-distance ride-sharing platform (www.blablacar.com).</p><p>All data, analysis scripts, and preregistration documents are available at the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/y4e93/?view_only=83b53fbd93a14620a1dad4cd23cf95b1). We report how our sample sizes were determined, all data exclusions, and all measures in the studies. We highlight instances in which we diverged from the preregistered plan.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>In Study 1, we examined the effect of profile photos on consumer preferences within the Couchsurfing platform. We created simplified versions of real Couchsurfing profiles and asked participants to examine the profiles and indicate their willingness to stay with each host. Each Couchsurfing profile includes a profile photo next to various other information about the host of their home (the sleeping arrangement, hosts' interests and likes, a review score, etc.). Crucially, we manipulated whether profiles were shown with or without a personal photo of hosts. This allowed us to examine the effect of profile photos on participants' preferences while keeping all other information about the host and their home constant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This study was preregistered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants.</head><p>The results of an a priori power analyses are reported in the Supplemental Materials. We recruited 95 psychology students at a Dutch university who participated in return for partial course credit. Data from 19 participants (20%) who indicated poor or basic English proficiency was excluded, leaving a final sample of 76 participants (47.37% female; Mage = 20.82, SDage = 1.97).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials.</head><p>We created 32 simplified versions of Couchsurfing profiles. The profiles were based on those of actual hosts from Amsterdam, whose apartments were available for guests on 29 June 2017. Profiles of 16 male and 16 female hosts were selected. We created simplified profiles based on the information that is displayed when people first access a host's profile. This included a host's profile photo, age, gender, their number of references, a short text about the host (where hosts typically describe themselves or their interests), and the sleeping arrangement PROFILE PHOTO PREFERENCE 7 (e.g., separate bed in a private room, couch in the living room). Names were omitted to ensure their anonymity. Next, we created four sets of stimuli. Each set contained all profiles. We varied which random quarter of profiles was displayed without a profile photo.</p><p>Procedure. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four sets of profiles. They were asked to imagine they were looking for a place to stay in Amsterdam for the weekend.</p><p>After reading a short text about the Couchsurfing network, they viewed the 32 profiles in a random order. To measure host preferences, participants were asked to rate their willingness to stay with a given host on a scale from -3 (I would not consider staying with this person) to 3 (I would really like to stay with this person). We also measured whether participants had ever made use of Couchsurfing and, if not, whether they would consider doing so in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Example of a Couchsurfing listing that participants viewed in Studies 1-3.</p><p>Note. In our studies we used the text and photos from real Couchsurfing profiles. To preserve the anonymity of hosts, this example uses an AI-generated photo and text that was generated by ChatGPT. In one condition, the host's profile photo was visible. In the other condition, it was replaced with a white silhouette against a gray background.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>On average, participants' willingness to stay with the hosts was slightly above the midpoint of our scale (M = 0.11, SD = 1.72). Participants' average willingness to stay across all hosts ranged from -1.59 to 2.00 (on our scale that ranged from -3 to 3). The average minimum willingness to stay was -2.67, whereas the average maximum willingness to stay was 2.70. Thus, even though the mean willingness to stay with hosts across all trials and participants was around the midpoint of our scale, there was substantial variation across different hosts and across different participants. Eight participants (10.53%) reported having used Couchsurfing before and 40 participants (52.63%) indicated that they would consider Couchsurfing in the future.</p><p>To test how willingness to stay was affected by the presence vs. absence of a profile photo, we estimated a multilevel regression model with random intercepts and random slopes per listing and per participant. Regressing willingness to stay on a dummy variable indicating whether the profile included a photo (0 = photo missing, 1 = photo available) revealed a positive effect β = PROFILE PHOTO PREFERENCE 9 0.846, SE = 0.124, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.596, 1.092], t(50.6) = 6.82, p &lt; .001. Thus, holding all other information in a profile constant, participants were more reluctant to stay with hosts without a profile photo (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>In Study 2, we attempted to replicate and results of Study 1 effect in a larger sample of participants. Crucially, we also investigated the role of trust in explaining consumers' avoidance of hosts without profile photos. We examined (a) whether participants would show greater distrust towards Couchsurfing hosts when they do not include a personal photo in their profile and (b) whether lower trust can explain why participants are less willing to stay with hosts without profile photos.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This study was preregistered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants.</head><p>The results of an a priori power analysis are reported in the Supplemental Materials. We recruited 168 psychology students at a Dutch University who participated in return for partial course credit. Data from 2 participants (1.79%) who always indicated the same PROFILE PHOTO PREFERENCE 10 willingness to stay or trust rating and from 12 participants (7.12%) who indicated poor or basic English proficiency was excluded, leaving a final sample of 154 participants (62.29% female; Mage = 21.93, SDage = 4.32). Thus, our sample was slightly smaller than our preregistered sample size.</p><p>Materials and procedure. We selected 18 profiles of 9 male and 9 female hosts that were also used in Study 2. Next, we created three sets of stimuli. Each set contained all profiles.</p><p>We varied which random third of profiles was displayed without a profile photo. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three sets and they viewed the profiles in a random order.</p><p>To measure host preferences, participants were again asked to rate their willingness to stay with a given host on a scale from -3 (I would not consider staying with this person) to 3 (I would really like to stay with this person). To measure trust in hosts, participants then saw each profile again and they were asked to rate how much they think they can trust the host on a scale from -3 (I do not trust this person at all) to 3 (I trust this person very much). We also measured whether participants had ever made use of Couchsurfing and, if not, whether they would consider doing so in the future.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>Average levels of trust in hosts (M = 0.14, SD = 1.78) and willingness to stay with hosts (M = 0.05, SD = 1.86) were slightly above the midpoint of our scale. Participants' average willingness to stay across all hosts ranged from -2.83 to 1.94 (on our scale that ranged from -3 to 3). The average minimum willingness to stay was -2.52, whereas the average maximum willingness to stay was 2.50. Thus, even though the mean willingness to stay with hosts across all trials and participants was around the midpoint of our scale, there was substantial variation across different hosts and across different participants. Nineteen participants (12.34%) reported having used Couchsurfing before and 75 participants (48.70%) indicated that they would consider using Couchsurfing in the future.</p><p>First, we tested how participants' willingness to stay with a host was affected by the presence vs. absence of a profile photo by estimating a multilevel regression model with random intercepts and slopes per listing and per participant. Regressing willingness to stay on a dummy variable indicating whether the profile included a photo (0 = photo missing, 1 = photo available) revealed a positive effect, β = 1.111, SE = 0.122, 95% CI [0.866, 1.325], t(33.88) = 9.13, p &lt; .001. In other words, participants were more reluctant to stay with hosts without a profile photo PROFILE PHOTO PREFERENCE 11 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>), replicating results of Study 1. We also tested how trust in hosts was affected by the presence vs. absence of a profile photo. Regressing trust on photo availability revealed a positive effect β = 1.255, SE = 0.135, 95% CI [1.004, 1.523], t(32.45) = 9.30, p &lt; .001.</p><p>Participants trusted hosts without a profile photo less (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3)</ref>. Thus, we found that participants were less willing to stay with hosts (replicating results of Study 1) and they were trusted less when their profile did not include a personal photo.</p><p>We also used the mediation package in R to test whether the effect of photo availability on willingness to stay was mediated by trust towards the hosts. As the mediation package only supports models with one, but not multiple random effects, we participant-centered trust and willingness to stay ratings. We then estimated a model with random intercepts and random slopes per listing. This analysis yielded a significant association between photo availability on willingness to stay via trust, β = 0.663, 95% CI [0.536, 0.790], p &lt; .001. The association between photo availability and willingness to stay-while controlling for trust-was also significant, β = 0.451, 95% CI [0.305, 0.590], p &lt; .001. These results suggest that consumers' distrust towards hosts who withhold personal photos may explain why these hosts are avoided.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3</head><p>Previous studies have shown that consumers systematically avoid sellers with certain characteristics, such as unattractive sellers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jaeger et al., 2019)</ref> or sellers from racial minorities <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Nødtvedt et al., 2021)</ref>. For these sellers, disclosing their appearance via a profile photo can potentially decrease consumer interest leading to lower earning opportunities. In other words, although displaying a profile photo may have a positive effect on consumer engagement in general, withholding a profile photo may actually pay off for sellers for whom displaying a profile photo would lead to negative consequences.</p><p>Based on this reasoning, we tested three related hypotheses in Study 3 (n = 150). First, we attempted to replicate previous studies on attractiveness biases in the sharing economy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jaeger et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Peng et al., 2020)</ref>. We tested whether people show a higher willingness to stay with attractive-looking (vs. unattractive-looking) hosts. Second, we examine whether different sellers face different penalties when choosing to omit a personal photo. We test whether the absence of a profile photo has a more negative effect for hosts who might experience a benefit from revealing their appearance (i.e., attractive hosts), compared to hosts who might experience a cost from revealing their appearance (i.e., unattractive hosts). Third, we test PROFILE PHOTO PREFERENCE 13 whether unattractive hosts can create more consumer interest by omitting a profile photo from their listing. That is, we investigate whether an unattractive profile photo or the absence of a profile photo leads to a lower consumer engagement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This study was preregistered.</p><p>Participants. We used Prolific to recruit participants from the United Kingdom who completed the study in return for £1. We recruited participants between the ages of 18 and 30 because we expected this age group to be more acquainted with (and more likely users of)</p><p>sharing economy platforms such as Couchsurfing. We preregistered to recruit 150 participants. A sample of 177 participants was collected and in line with our preregistered exclusion criteria, data from 1 participant (0.57%) who always indicated the same willingness to stay with hosts, 1 participant (0.57%) who indicated poor or basic English proficiency was excluded, and 24 participants who indicated having completed the study on a cell phone were excluded from analysis, leaving a final sample of 150 participants (62.00% female; Mage = 23.44, SDage = 3.58).</p><p>Materials and procedure. We selected 24 profiles of 12 male and 12 female hosts that were also used in Study 2. For each profile, we created three versions. In one version, the host's profile photo was missing, and a stylized silhouette of a face was displayed. In the other two versions, we randomly matched the profile with an attractive or an unattractive facial photograph. The images were taken from the 10k Faces Database, which contains a large set of images sourced from the internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bainbridge et al., 2013)</ref>. The database also contains average attractiveness ratings for each image. The ratings were provided by a sample of MTurk workers.</p><p>We selected the 12 individuals with the lowest attractiveness score and the 12 individuals with the highest attractiveness score for men (low attractiveness: M = 2.26, SD = 0.16, high attractiveness: M = 3.84, SD = 0.16) and women (low attractiveness: M = 1.98, SD = 0.31, high attractiveness: M = 4.54, SD = 0.09) and randomly matched them with a profile of the same gender.</p><p>Next, we created three stimulus sets. Each set included all 24 profiles. We varied which third of profiles was displayed without a photo, with an attractive photo, or with an unattractive photo. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three sets. To measure host preferences, participants were again asked to rate their willingness to stay with a given host on a scale from -3 (I would not consider staying with this person) to 3 (I would really like to stay with this person).</p></div>

Participants' average willingness to stay across all hosts ranged from -2.92 to 2.46 (on our scale that ranged from -3 to 3). The average minimum willingness to stay was -2.73, whereas the average maximum willingness to stay was 2.37. Thus, even though the mean willingness to stay with hosts across all trials and participants was around the midpoint of our scale, there was substantial variation across different hosts and across different participants. Only 2 participants (1.33%) reported having used Couchsurfing before, but 74 participants (49.33%) indicated that they would consider using Couchsurfing in the future.</p><p>First, we tested how participants' willingness to stay with a host was affected by the presence vs. absence of a profile photo.

Participants indicated a higher willingness to stay with attractive hosts who displayed, rather than withheld, a photo, β = 0.648, SE = 0.086, 95% CI [0.471, 0.819], t(35.71) = 7.51, p &lt; .001 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). We also found that participants indicated a higher willingness to stay with unattractive hosts who displayed, rather than withheld, a photo, β = 0.378, SE = 0.096, 95% CI [0.174, 0.589], t(41.73) = 3.95, p &lt; .001 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4)</ref>. Crucially, the positive effect of displaying a photo was significantly larger for attractive hosts, z = 2.09, p = .036.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In Study 3, we replicated the finding that participants are less willing to stay with hosts who do not include a personal photo in their profile with a sample of U.S. American participants recruited via Prolific. We also conducted a meta-analysis, estimating the effect of profile photo availability on participants' host preferences across the three studies. On average, participants' willingness to stay with a host was 0.8 points lower on our 7-point scale when the host was not displaying a personal photo (full results are reported in the Supplemental Materials). In line with previous work (e.g., Jaeger et al., 2019), we found that participants also showed a preference for attractive-looking hosts. Participants indicated a higher willingness to stay in a home when the profile photo showed an attractive (vs. unattractive host). Crucially, participants were more willing to stay with unattractive hosts than with hosts without a profile photo. Even for hosts with characteristics that are disfavored by consumers (here, an unattractive facial appearance), it was still beneficial to display a personal photo that gives away their appearance, rather than withhold it. In other words, we find that at least with the present study design and photo stimuli, the no-photo penalty was larger than the unattractiveness penalty.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4</head><p>Results of Studies 1-3 suggest that consumers tend to avoid and distrust sellers who choose not to display a profile photo. In Study 4, our primary goal was to test if this preference for profile photos can also be observed in a real-life market. One prior analysis of Airbnb hosts showed that hosts without a profile photo received lower review scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Jang, 2023)</ref>. However, given that reviews were provided after guests had stayed with hosts it is unclear whether the disparity in review scores was caused by the absence of a profile photo or by guests' direct experience with hosts. Here, we aimed to test more directly for an association between the presence vs. absence of a profile photo and the earning opportunities of hosts.</p><p>Following previous work on consumer preferences in the sharing economy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Edelman &amp; Luca, 2014)</ref>, we relied on hedonic price analysis. As data on consumer choices and their determinants are usually not available, hedonic pricing models attempt to shed light on which attributes are preferred by consumers by testing which attributes of a good or service are predictive of its price (for detailed explanations, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jaeger &amp; Sleegers, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Malpezzi, 2008)</ref>. The core idea behind this approach is that if a good or service has characteristics that are favored by consumers, then this should lead to increased demand (i.e. a higher willingness to pay), which allows sellers to charge higher prices. 1 Conversely, this means that we can understand consumer preferences by examining the association between the price of a good or service and its characteristics. For example, we can predict the prices of Airbnb listings with characteristics of the apartment, the host, and any other attributes that may influence consumer preferences. Attributes that are favored by consumers should be associated with higher prices.</p><p>Previous findings support this prediction. Airbnb listings with characteristics that one would expect consumers to prefer (e.g., better review scores, larger apartments, more attractive locations) are associated with higher asking prices <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jaeger &amp; Sleegers, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>We leveraged the same method to test if consumers prefer sellers who display (rather than withhold) profile photos. We analyzed data from BlaBlaCar (www.blablacar.com), a popular ride-sharing platform that operates in 21 countries, collecting a sample of 461 advertised 1 Sellers could also increase supply to meet demand. However, in many cases, supply is relatively inflexible. Airbnb hosts who rent out an extra room in their apartment cannot increase their supply even when their listing is extremely popular because they can only rent out their room to one occupant on any given night. They can, however, easily increase the price of their listing to capture demand. In sharing economy markets, supply is relatively inflexible, which means that prices should be more indicative of demand. rides between various cities in Germany. We recorded the price of the advertised rides, whether the driver chose to display a profile photo, and various other attributes that may influence booking decisions (e.g., the driver's review score, the level of comfort of their car). If consumers prefer sellers with a profile photo, then we should observe a positive association between profile photo presence and prices, controlling for all other relevant attributes of the advertised ride.</p><p>We also examined how consumers' perceptions of sellers based on their profile photo affected their choices. Previous work, including results of Study 3, suggests that consumers favor attractive-looking <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jaeger et al., 2019)</ref> or trustworthy-looking hosts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ert et al., 2016)</ref>. We recruited participants to rate drivers' profile photos to test if attractive-looking, trustworthylooking, or competent-looking drivers charge higher prices for otherwise similar ratings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>This study was preregistered.</p><p>BlaBlaCar data. Data on all rides advertised on BlaBlaCar for a pre-defined set of intercity connections that were offered on three different dates <ref type="bibr">(Sunday, 5 March 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wednesday, 8</ref> March 2017; Friday, 10 March 2017) was collected. Twelve trips across Germany with varying lengths were sampled. The length of the trips ranged from 82 km (Augsburg to Ulm) to 586 km (Berlin to Munich). Data was collected one to three days prior to the ride. Only drivers who had offered at least five rides before and who had received at least one review were selected. For each ride, we recorded the price of the ride and whether a photo of the driver is available. Profile photos were downloaded when available. The gender, age, review score (ranging from one to five), driving style (ranging from one to three), and experience of the driver (four levels), the number of offered rides, the number of reviews, whether the trip departed at night (between 10 pm and 6 am), and the comfort of the car (four levels) were also recorded. In total, data on 582 rides was collected.</p><p>Rides by drivers who had a high number of offered rides (i.e., 2 standard deviations above the mean) were eliminated and only one ride per driver was included. One ride was removed because the profile photo showed two individuals. Fifty-nine rides were eliminated because data on the driver's age, experience level, or the car's comfort level was missing, leaving a final sample of 461 rides.</p><p>Participants. We recruited 716 US workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to rate the drivers' profile photos in exchange for $0.50. Data from 8 participants (1.12%) who always PROFILE PHOTO PREFERENCE 18 indicated the same rating was discarded, leaving a final sample of 708 participants (Mage = 34.91, SDage = 11.21; 40.5% female).</p><p>Procedure. Participants saw a random subset of 56 profile photos and were asked to rate the person on trustworthiness, competence, or attractiveness on a 9-point scale ranging from 1 (not at all [trait]) to 9 (extremely [trait]). Each participant rated the photos on only one trait dimension and each photo was rated by at least 24 participants. The average rating on each trait was calculated as an indicator of perceived trustworthiness, competence, and attractiveness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Multilevel regression models with price as the outcome variable and random intercepts per trip were estimated. The price of the ride, the number of reviews, and the number of rides offered were log10-transformed due to their skewed distributions. The driver's age and the three trait score were z-standardized. We preregistered to control for driving style in our models, but a substantial number of drivers (23.64%) had missing data for this variable. Therefore, we first present analyses that omit driving style as a covariate but are therefore based on a larger number of observations. As a robustness check, we also present analyses that include driving style as a covariate.</p><p>Prices of the advertised rides ranged from $4.72 to $57.82 (M = $19.97, SD = $10.33, Mdn = $16.52). 2 Of the 461 drivers, 400 (84.75%) had a photo available, whereas 61 (15.25%) did not. Drivers were on average 34 years old (SD = 10.31) and 83.5% were male. Detailed descriptive statistics are reported in the Supplemental Materials.</p><p>First, we tested whether drivers with a profile photo charged higher prices for their rides than drivers without a profile photo (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, Model 1). In line with this hypothesis, photo availability positively predicted price, b = 0.037, SE = 0.013, 95% CI [0.013, 0.063], t(436.1) = 2.85, p = .005. Specifically, drivers with a profile photo charged 8.96% higher prices.</p><p>Next, we tested whether drivers that are perceived to be more trustworthy, competent, or attractive charged higher prices for their rides (see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>, Model 2). Results showed no association between the price of advertised rides and drivers' perceived trustworthiness, b = 0.0003, SE = 0.005, 95% CI [-0.010, 0.010], t(373.1) = 0.05, p = .96, competence, b = 0.006, SE 2 Original prices were in Euro.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In line with our experimental data, the results of our hedonic price analysis suggest that consumers prefer sellers with profile photos. BlaBlaCar drivers without a profile photo charged approximately 9-11% lower prices compared to drivers with a profile photo.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Sharing economy sellers may choose not to display a profile photo because of general privacy concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dillahunt &amp; Malone, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Penman et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ranzini et al., 2017)</ref> or because they wish to conceal their appearance or social identity to prevent discrimination or other unfavorable treatment by consumers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Jaeger et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Nødtvedt et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Troncoso &amp; Luo, 2023</ref>). Here, we tested whether this strategy comes at the cost of decreased consumer trust and engagement. Trust is an important predictor of consumer decision-making in the sharing economy and consumers rely on profile photos (next to other cues) to assess the trustworthiness of sellers <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ert &amp; Fleischer, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kong et al., 2020)</ref>. Thus, they may avoid sellers without a profile photo. Four preregistered studies supported this hypothesis, showing that consumers distrust and avoid sellers without a profile photo.</p><p>In Studies 1-3, we showed participants simplified but realistic Couchsurfing profiles and measured their (hypothetical) willingness to stay with different hosts. Crucially, we manipulated whether hosts displayed a personal photo on their profile. We found consistent evidence that, all other aspects of the profile being equal, participants were less willing to stay with hosts when they did not display a profile photo (meta-analytic results across Studies 1-3 are reported in the Supplemental Materials). These findings are in line with previous work by <ref type="bibr">Fagerstrøm and colleagues (2017)</ref>, who found similar results for consumer preferences for Airbnb hosts. In their study, participants' preferences for profile photos were perhaps less surprising given that the photos were the only piece of personal information about hosts. Our results show that participants penalize hosts without a profile photo even when they have access to other personal information about them (i.e., gender, age, and an "about me" section).</p><p>Our studies also extended previous work on the topic. In line with the idea that profile photos reduce anonymity and increase consumer trust, we found that participants reported lower levels of trust towards hosts when they did not display a profile photo and participants' trust towards hosts was positively related to their willingness to stay with them (Study 2). Results of Study 3 shed more light on the size of the no-photo penalty. In line with previous work (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jaeger et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Peng et al., 2020)</ref>, we found that participants favored attractive-looking over unattractive-looking Couchsurfing hosts. This may indicate that at least some hosts could be better off not sharing a profile photo if it discloses an appearance or group membership that leads to consumer disengagement. Yet, in our study, even hosts with an unattractive appearance were PROFILE PHOTO PREFERENCE 22 more popular when they displayed (vs. withheld) a profile photo. Participants were more willing to stay with unattractive hosts than with hosts without a profile photo. Thus, we found that the no-photo penalty was larger than the unattractiveness penalty.</p><p>Finally, in Study 4, we tested if consumers' preference for profile photos can also be observed in a real-life market. A hedonic price analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Malpezzi, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Rosen, 1974)</ref> of 461 rides advertised on BlaBlaCar, a long-distance ride-sharing market, revealed that drivers with a profile photo charged approximately 9-11% higher prices for otherwise similar rides (i.e., after controlling for a host of other factors that could vary between drivers who display vs. omit profile photos). This price premium suggests that consumers prefer sellers with profile photos, which allows them to charge higher prices. Similar price premiums (or penalties) have been observed for other seller characteristics in the sharing economy. For example, previous studies observed a price penalty of approximately 6% for Black (vs. White) Airbnb hosts in the United</p><p>States <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Jaeger &amp; Sleegers, 2023)</ref>. In contrast to previous work that examined data from Airbnb <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ert et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jaeger et al., 2019)</ref>, we did not find evidence suggesting that consumers favor attractive-looking or trustworthy-looking BlaBlaCar drivers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical and Practical Implications</head><p>The present results are in line with general theoretical models of consumer decisionmaking in the sharing economy, which highlight that consumers (a) assess the trustworthiness of sellers based on available cues, such as profile photos, and (b) rely on their trustworthiness judgments when choosing between sellers <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kong et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mayayise, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Teubner et al., 2014)</ref>. Our results also highlight an important part of sellers' "privacy calculus" <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dinev &amp; Hart, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Olivero &amp; Lunt, 2004)</ref>. Sellers are thought to weigh the potential costs and benefits when deciding which information to disclose. In the present case, we find that the benefits of increased anonymity from not posting a profile photo can have significant costs in the form of lower consumer trust and engagement, which can ultimately lower sellers' expected earnings. Thus, sellers must engage in tradeoffs because of a direct conflict between anonymity and economic benefits.</p><p>Sharing economy platforms also play an important role in how these issues are navigated, as they decide which information about sellers is mandatory to display and which information is deliberately omitted (at least at some transaction stages) to prevent discrimination. For example, in response to the widespread media coverage on racial bias in the sharing economy, Airbnb has PROFILE PHOTO PREFERENCE 23 implemented some changes to its design that are meant to mitigate discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Airbnb, 2020)</ref>. It remains to be seen how effective such changes are, but results of some studies suggest that racial discrimination can be mitigated by changing the design of the website or the booking process (e.g., by making photos less prominent or more relevant information more prominent; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cui et al., 2020)</ref>. However, sellers should also be aware that when weighing privacy concerns against higher expected earnings, the priorities of sellers and companies may not be aligned.</p><p>Although both individual sellers and sharing economy platforms profit with higher consumer engagement, only sellers bear the costs of sharing personal information (and potentially becoming the target of discrimination).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>We used two approaches with complementary strengths and limitations to investigate whether consumers avoid sellers without a profile photo. In Study 4, we analyzed real-word data from BlaBlaCar. Preferences for drivers with (vs. without) a photo should lead to stronger demand for their rides, which would allow them to charge higher process for otherwise equivalent rides. To isolate the influence of profile photos, we controlled for a host of other attributes that may vary between drivers who show vs. withhold photo and which may influence consumer preferences. Still, we can only draw limited inferences about the causal role of profile photos on consumer choices based on this correlational design. Stronger evidence for the causal role of profile photos was provided by the results of Studies 1-3, in which we manipulated the availability of a profile photo while keeping all other listing information constant. Thus, although our study designs varied in how closely they approximate real life decision processes in the sharing economy and how strongly we can infer a causal relation between photo availability and consumer choice from the results, converging results from all four studies provide stronger evidence for such an effect.</p><p>Although participants in our studies had access to more information about hosts than in previous studies (which should provide a more accurate estimate of the impact of profile photos on choices), we did remove hosts' name to provide some level of anonymity. If people are more likely to trust hosts who disclose their name, then removing this cue may also inflate the importance of (and participants' reliance on) profile photos. This limitation did not apply to the results of Study 4, where we examined real-world price data for listings that contained the driver's name, photo, and other personal information. The present results provide more robust PROFILE PHOTO PREFERENCE 24 evidence that profile photos affect consumer choice-even when people have access to other (personal) information about sellers-but more research is needed to better understand how much weight people put on photos, names, and other cues to a seller's identity and trustworthiness.</p><p>Results of Studies 1-3 were based on samples of relatively young participants from Western European countries. We do not consider participants' age to be a limitation of the current studies (in fact, we explicitly sampled young participants from Prolific in Study 3)</p><p>because sharing economy platforms such as Couchsurfing, BlaBlaCar, and Airbnb are primarily used by young adults. Although a minority of participants in our sample reported having used</p><p>Couchsurfing themselves, around 50% indicated that they would be open to using it in the future.</p><p>Additional work is needed to test if the present results replicate with participants from other cultures, especially in non-Western samples.</p><p>Future studies should also investigate the privacy calculus of sharing economy sellers more directly. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Airbnb hosts from racial minorities withhold (or display fake) profile photos to hide their ethnic background because of experiences with discrimination <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Penman et al., 2016)</ref>. One study with mostly African American sharing economy participants found that the majority of participants reported a reluctance to disclose photos and other personal information due to privacy and security concerns. However, the sample size of this study was very small (n = 20). Additional studies are needed to systematically understand which information sellers are most reluctant to share, why sellers may choose to withhold a profile photo, whether some sellers experience stronger concerns, and whether this influences their participation and experiences in the sharing economy.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>intercepts and slopes per listing and per participant.
