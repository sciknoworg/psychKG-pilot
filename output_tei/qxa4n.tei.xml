				<p>This text was originally a dissertation summary submitted to pre-examination. I wrote it in a language and style I enjoyed writing, but which did not sufficiently meet what is expected from an academic dissertation summary. Hence, there exists an edition which is written (and, to an extent, procrusteanised) to be more appropriate for academic audiences, in the familiar structure of introduction, aims, methods, results, and discussion. The accepted, rewritten overview is found in Heino (2025).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A major change in the later submission is a move of emphasis, shifting from the more generalist perspective presented here, to a more specialist one. The background and topics covered in the later version have been mostly narrowed down to focus only on articles contained in the dissertation, whereas the ideas presented here, are based on a much broader literature. The newer text places less emphasis on practice and understanding of complexity, and more to basic research and analysis in the field of behaviour change.</p><p>I do retain some pride in the overview version you are reading. It generated significant interest and praise among some audiences, and I hence opted to keep it publicly available, instead of having it be superseded by the version in the published dissertation. I consider that later work another branch of the thinking that generated this one, warranting the change of title (new title being 'Complex Systems and Behaviour Change Science: Bridging Far Away Lands'; <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Heino, 2025)</ref>. During the writing of the later work, this branch also evolved into a publication discussing decision making in organisational and societal contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(Heino et al., 2024)</ref>. The branches will hopefully come together as a book one day.</p><p>There is much to do, and I myself am but a recovering linear thinker. I welcome efforts to develop ideas within the current work, as well as those mentioned above.</p><p>This work argues that people are active agentic creatures, who are self-determined and self-organising experts of their own environments, which infuses social systems with inherent non-stationarity and hence uncertainty: Objects of study in behaviour change science, as well as their relationships, change. In addition, small events can cause large impacts, and long periods of apparent stability can be punctuated by rapid change. This implies that past data may be of limited use for inference and interventions across contexts or time. Indeed, the opportunities and risks laying in the future of complex systems or decision making contexts, are vastly more numerous than those which could be called merely complicated. Therefore, it should be carefully evaluated, to what extent a given situation is indeed amenable to decomposition-based solutions. While it might be impossible to predict the long-term future of some complex "non-linear" systems, risks and opportunities can be evaluated based on evolutionary potential of their space of possibilities.</p><p>The specific contribution of articles included in this work supports the argument as follows. Article I takes the view of people as agentic, autonomous decision makers, and points to the need to foster their capacity to self-organise. It describes a compendium of techniques, which (combined with proper scaffolding and support) could enable individuals to better self-manage their motivation and behaviour. Article II uses data containing self-management techniques to demonstrate a conceptually important model, where behaviours -and what the literature has conventionally considered their influences, precursors, or determinants -are represented as components of a mutually interacting network. The network representation reflects a deviation from the conventional conceptualisation, which hinges on component-dominant dynamics to depict simplistic causes and their effects with boxes and arrows. The article also discusses the importance of distributional shapes, as well as how summary statistics developed for simple, symmetric distributions can misdirect inference when the shape is more varied. Article III proposes a process definition of behaviour change, particularly calling for attention to some core features of complex systems; interconnectedness, non-ergodicity and non-linearity. It points out how interaction-dominant dynamics can produce distributional shapes, poorly amenable conventional analysis. It also discusses problems of traditional linear models of between-individual data for studying behaviour change, and expands the idea of aforementioned between-individual networks to those containing temporal recurrences of idiographic system states -attractors. Article IV depicts how the conceptualisation of behaviour change as movement in an attractor landscape can be used to understand change on different scales of observation, from individuals to communities and the society at large. It brings our attention to how non-linearities in interconnected systems can mean sudden transitions after long periods of stability and, more generally, the need to be wary of attractor states yet unseen, when there is uncertainty about distribution shapes.</p><p>To address the transparency and irreducibility concerns currently being voiced across scientific disciplines, all the data and analysis scripts are made publicly available online. Apart from Article I, these supplements are produced directly from the data as accompanying websites to reduce error and increase accessibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR NON-ACADEMIC READERS</head><p>In an ever-evolving world, the role of human behaviour in addressing pressing challenges cannot be overstated. Complex issues like climate change, pandemic response, and psychosocial well-being all hinge on human actions. Thus, understanding and steering positive behaviour change is of paramount importance.</p><p>Traditionally, behaviour change research uses a decomposition-based approach, dissecting behaviours pertaining to societal problems into smaller parts and addressing each one separately. To get the picture, imagine a designer focused on building an engine part by part, fine-tuning each piece before fitting them together. This method works when we can clearly map out the pieces, their interactions are limited, and their effects are well understood. This is the domain of the decomposition-minded planning; the "ordered regime", so to say.</p><p>However, human behaviour often does not always exist in such neatly compartmentalised contexts. Instead, it often operates within complex, dynamic systems where the individual pieces continually interact, mutually influencing each other in unpredictable ways. Consider a forest, for example. It's not just about individual trees; the entire ecosystem, with its array of flora and fauna, weather patterns, and soil conditions, all contribute to the forest's health. You can not simply study a single tree to understand the whole forest. This ecosystem view is the realm of the complexity-minded designer, who acknowledges that problems may not be easily separated but are woven into a larger, interconnected tapestry; the "complex regime".</p><p>The current work suggests that an awareness of these so-called complex systems can enhance our approach to behaviour change. It argues that we are all active participants in our environments, capable of self-determination and self-organisation. Our behaviour is not just the result of isolated influences; instead, it often emerges from an ongoing web of interdependencies. A small action today can lead to major impacts tomorrow, and long periods of apparent stability can suddenly be disrupted by bursts of rapid change. This inherently unpredictable nature of complex regimes means that past data can not always guide us in the future.</p><p>To navigate these complex systems, we need a new kind of designer: the evolutionary-minded designer. This designer harnesses the power of evolution, creating a wide range of possible solutions and allowing the system to select the most appropriate ones. The goal is to create flexible, adaptive systems that are resilient in the face of change and uncertaintynot just solutions, which rely on correct prediction of the specifics of the future.</p><p>The work presented in this dissertation provides concepts and tools to initiate this approach. It includes a compendium of self-management techniques to empower individuals, and proposes a model of behaviour change as an interconnected network of processes, rather than a series of isolated, static entities. It also discusses how traditional linear models may fail in the face of complex systems and suggests ways of understanding and influencing behaviour change, which may help bridge the gap between social psychology and complex systems science.</p><p>In a world that's increasingly complex and interconnected, our approach to behaviour change must adapt. By embracing complexity, we can better equip ourselves to face the challenges of the future. Rather than trying to oversimplify these complex problems, we should recognize and leverage the inherent richness and unpredictability of human behaviour -where it exists -aiming to develop responsive, adaptable strategies that foster positive change in this uncertain world.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The world is evolving in an unprecedented pace, as global interdependence grows and problems formerly locally confined, can grow to cause cascading impacts. Many of these problems contain behaviours; those pertaining to health, energy use, (mis)information sharing, crisis preparedness and so on. While many fields study human behaviour, much of social psychology's appeal as an approach to understanding and changing important behaviours, stems from its embrace of different scales of observation: from processes taking place within individuals, to those in dyads, groups, communities and the society <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Hagger, Cameron, et al., 2020)</ref>. In social psychology, a multiscale view is not optional.</p><p>In the current work, I flesh out some key concepts to begin understanding behaviour-based problems through the lens of complex systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam, 2020a)</ref>, with the aim of providing students, researchers, practitioners and policy makers some conceptual tools necessary to eventually make a little more informed decisions in academic and practical contexts. The work also aims to sketch a complex systems based paradigm for behaviour change science, complementary to current practice, and highly necessary for tackling contemporary challenges.</p><p>Much of the paradigm flows from Aristotle's notion that "the totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something besides the parts" (n.d./2009), which has become almost a cliché in popular discourse, having been made famous by <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Anderson's (1972)</ref> article More is different. It also applies to the context of the summary you are currently reading: The summary describes a whole, which emerges from but does not reduce to the parts, i.e. the articles contained. From the perspective of the emergent whole, Article I lays the foundation for self-determination as a central theme, motivating data collection for Articles II and III. Article II serves us as a largely imperfect stepping stone -introducing the idea of networkstowards raising the issues described in Article III. Article III introduces the perspective of complex systems in behaviour change research, and lays the groundwork for Article IV. Article IV describes in more depth attractor landscapes, a widely applicable tool to understand change processes. Some concepts from complex systems science but less known in the social sciences -such as Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety and the complexity profile -need to be introduced in this summary, as they articulate a) why complexity thinking is increasingly necessary and b) why in the multiscale perspective not everything is equally complex, respectively. The most important implications for policy making and other practice lie in understanding the potential of silent risk to transform our organisations and societies. The contribution I hope to make is in the practice of "turning some black swans grey" <ref type="bibr" target="#b232">(Taleb, 2016)</ref>; making the unthinkable a little more thinkable.</p><p>Although all the articles used to build the argument contain empirical data, the data is there mainly to demonstrate more fundamental concepts -from the perspective of the whole that emerges from the four articles, its role is peripheral. In each piece, there has been an effort to keep a skeptical maxim in mind: Would this argument bear weight even if the data turned out to have been in error? As such, the data ought to be understood as demonstrations and proofs of concept, which are chosen for their fit to what the empirical behaviour change researcher is used to, and not necessarily representative of the mathematically intensive complex systems science toolbox.</p><p>Our progression will be as follows. I will first introduce a crisis of confidence in social psychology, which has driven soul-searching and novel developments in the field, including calls to better incorporate this thing called complexity. I will also introduce behaviour change science and self-determination theory, with the intention of pointing out what these have to do with complex systems science and solving potentially intractable societal problems. I will then introduce complex systems, and lay out key features of a proposal for a complexity-aware approach to behaviour change science, drawing from Articles I-IV. Finally, I will discuss some implications for policy. Along the way, we will need to help a friend move, make a stop to get bitten in a knife fight, and visit a heavy metal concert -so let us get started.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY AND ITS CRISES</head><p>The word crisis has been used liberally when describing growing pains of social psychology as a discipline, which aims to be both scientific and practical -while describing human systems on multiple scales, ranging from individual psychology to all the social forces that affect us. One major discussion took place in the 1970s, bearing the name crisis of confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Elms, 1975)</ref>; a term to resurface later in the contemporary context <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Earp &amp; Trafimow, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>My entry to the field coincided with this resurfacing, stemming from the aftermath of Daryl Bem's infamous experiments on extrasensory perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Bem, 2011)</ref>. The crux of the issue was not that an experiment demonstrating parapsychological findings was published in the flagship journal of social psychology, but that the journal refused to publish failed replication attempts <ref type="bibr" target="#b199">(Ritchie et al., 2012)</ref> -not because they were of questionable quality, but because they were assumed to be uninteresting to readers. This, naturally, sparked the question: If surprising research gets published, while the failures to replicate it do not, what kind of a literature are we going to end up with? Subsequent large-scale replication efforts of various effects sparked what became known as the replication crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Nosek et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Open Science Collaboration, 2015)</ref>. Since then, questionable research practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Agnoli et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">John et al., 2012)</ref> behind the crisis have been proposed to be mended by improving transparency in different phases of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">(Munafò et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">Munafò &amp; Smith, 2018)</ref>, but e.g. in medicine, bad reporting practice remains woefully common in spite of safeguards such as mandatory pre-registration of study plans . In addition, many of the perverse structural incentives driving bad practices in academic research <ref type="bibr" target="#b227">(Smaldino &amp; McElreath, 2016)</ref> remain in place. Hence, the jury is still out regarding whether real change in research practices is taking place, or if the current calls for rigour will be left unheeded as has been the fate of many such earlier pleas <ref type="bibr" target="#b152">(Meehl, 1967)</ref>.</p><p>Still, both global and local changes to research practices are happening. On the global scale, preprints are becoming a norm, and even novel, transparent forms of publishing such as registered reports are becoming more prevalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Nosek et al., 2022)</ref>. On the local scale, I vividly remember rooting against hypothesising after the results are known ('HARKing'; <ref type="bibr" target="#b133">Kerr, 1998)</ref> a decade ago with a social psychology faculty member -only to receive the reply "but that's how we write papers". I believe this conversation would be difficult to replicate today. Article II contributes to the transparency and reproducibility discussion in health psychology and behavioural medicine, by introducing a form of an accessible online supplement produced directly from data with open source scripts; this format is then used in subsequent articles.</p><p>The increased attention to replicability issues has also brought lesser known but no less important ontological and epistemic questions to the forefront of how we should understand social psychological systems as a topic of research; also discussed under the terms generalisability crisis <ref type="bibr">(Moeller et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b253">Yarkoni, 2022)</ref> and theory crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Eronen &amp; Bringmann, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b182">Oude Maatman, 2021)</ref>. For example, we may ask if it is reasonable to assume that we should be able to find replications of causal pathways such as those proposed by "mediation analysis" <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Kenny, 2008)</ref> claiming A causes B which causes C? Or might it rather be the case, that problems of replication in part stem from issues in how we oversimplify causation in complex systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Gernigon et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Heino et al., 2017;</ref>? This issue is discussed at some length in Articles III-IV, and we will return to it in due time. The rooting of complexity in interconnections, is curiously compatible with calls to bring relations to the forefront of sociology <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Emirbayer, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>The issues of replication, causation and complexity become more than solely academic problems when we start discussing knowledge's role in society. A divorce between social psychological research and its practical applications has been dubbed a practicability crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Berkman &amp; Wilson, 2021)</ref>, and associated concerns pertaining to descriptive (contra change-catalysing) research have been shared by prominent social psychologists <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Gergen, 2023)</ref>. The COVID-19 pandemic sparked global self-reflection in social and behavioural science researchers, as such a comprehensive issue cannot be resolved with medical expertise only. Instead, it requires multidisciplinary co-operation on "behavioural, environmental, social and systems interventions" to safeguard human life and societal functioning <ref type="bibr">(Bavel et al., 2020;</ref>, while the vestiges of academic structures are not optimally suited for the task.</p><p>Personally, I had the great opportunity to view this interplay between science and practice, as a member of the first behavioural science advisory group at the Finnish Prime Minister's office (Prime Minister's Office, 2023). Behaviour change science <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Hagger, Cameron, et al., 2020)</ref>, which hails from the social psychological tradition of studying change in attitudes and behaviours, with its rootedness in real-world problems, seemed integral to the task of treating a synergistic epidemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Lancet, 2017)</ref>. Unfortunately, our advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Heino, Kanerva, et al., 2021)</ref> had limited impact, which bears resemblance to other local and global efforts I took part in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Bar-Yam et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Lappalainen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Lazarus et al., 2022)</ref>, as well as the experiences of science advice in our neighbouring Sweden <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Brusselaers et al., 2022)</ref>. Much of the debates about optimal policy revolved around assumptions: Should it be assumed that herd immunity ends pandemics by itself? That airborne viral spread is negligible? Or that, in the absence of a known physiological mechanism, long-term sequelae of COVID-19 are predominantly a psychological condition? And what about whether we ought to trust the traditional simplistic compartmental models (e.g. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered -'SIR' -and its extensions; , inherent assumptions of which make it seem an elimination approach to curtail pathogen spread <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Baker et al., 2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Baker et al., , 2023</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">Philippe et al., 2023)</ref> is impossible?</p><p>Over time, each of these assumptions made by some authoritative factions of the scientific community were shown to be wrong, but none should have been the default choice in a situation where bets were high <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Brightling &amp; Evans, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Davis et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b165">Morawska et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b175">Oliu-Barton &amp; Pradelski, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam, 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b235">Taleb et al., 2020</ref>; WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2004; World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific <ref type="bibr">Knowledge and Technology, 2005)</ref>. What connects each of the assumptions is an implicit belief that the future resembles the past; belief in a stationary, linear, ergodic world -one discussed in Article III.</p><p>Having now discussed what motivates this work from the panoramic perspective of social psychology, let us next turn to the more specific case of behaviour change research, in which Articles I-IV are situated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">BEHAVIOUR CHANGE SCIENCE AND THE GHOST OF REDUCTIONISM</head><p>Behaviour change science refers to an interdisciplinary approach, which hails from social psychology and studies changing human behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Hagger, Cameron, et al., 2020)</ref>. The approach is motivated by the fact that many large problems we face today -be they about spreading misinformation, preventing non-communicable diseases, taking climate action, or preparing for pandemics -contain human action as major parts of both the problems and their solutions.</p><p>To better understand what behaviour change entails, we need to clarify five points. First, behaviour change in the current context is understood in a broad sense of the term, synonymous with human action. As such, it encompasses not only individuals, but also other scales of observation from dyads to small groups, communities and society at large. Social ecological models <ref type="bibr" target="#b206">(Ruiter et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b210">Salmon et al., 2020)</ref>, for example, encourage us to think in such a multiscale manner, considering how individuals are embedded within larger systems. As described in Article IV, methods for achieving change tend to differ for each scale; e.g. impacting communities is entails different tools than impacting individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Hagger, Cameron, et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Second, it should be noted that the term intervention is understood here in a broader sense than often taken in public discourse. I use it to depict any intentional change effort that shows up as an event in a system, from communication campaigns to structural measures such as regulation and taxation. And even at the individual level, behaviour change interventions do not need to imply that an individual's life is tampered with in a top-down manner; in fact, the best way to change behaviour is often to provide resources which enable the individual to act in better alignment with goals they have . Interventions can also change environments that hamper those goals, or provide social resources and connections, which enable individuals to take action with their compatriots. Enabling such self-organised behaviour change is one paradigmatic rationale behind Article I.</p><p>Third, a key background assumption in the perspective taken here, is that behaviour change is not an activity taken up by actors standing outside the system that's being intervened upon. Instead, best practices of intervention design compel us to work with stakeholders and communities when planning and implementing the interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Araújo-Soares et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bartholomew Eldredge et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b173">O'Cathain et al., 2019)</ref>. This imperative goes back to Kurt Lewin's action research <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adelman, 1993)</ref>, where participatory problem solving is combined with research activities.</p><p>Fourth, while interventions can be thought of as "events in systems" <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Hawe et al., 2009)</ref>, some of which produce lasting effects while others wash away, viewing interventions as transient programme-like entities can narrow our thinking of how enablement of incremental, evolutionary, bottom-up behaviour change could optimally take place. Governance is, after all, conducted by local stakeholders in constant contact with the system, with larger leeway to adjust actions without fear of breaking evaluation protocol, and hopefully "skin in the game" <ref type="bibr" target="#b233">(Taleb, 2018)</ref> perhaps long after intervention designers have moved on.</p><p>Fifth, nothing compels an intervention designer to infuse something novel into a system. For example, reverse translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b219">(Shakhnovich, 2018)</ref> studies what already works in practice, while aiming to learn how to replicate success elsewhere. De-implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b189">(Prasad &amp; Ioannidis, 2014)</ref>, on the other hand, studies what does not work, with the goal of removing practices causing harm. In fact, "Primum non nocere"; first, do no harm, is the single most important principle for behaviour change interventions (Araújo-Soares et al., 2019)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.1">LEARNING ABOUT WHAT WORKS -OR DOES NOT</head><p>As in action research, a key motivation in behaviour change research is often not only to solve problems, nor to advance knowledge, but to combine these two. For such an endeavour it is important to create a loop, which feeds problem solvers information about actions others have found useful, as well as those less so -in fact, sometimes knowing what does not work, is even more useful than knowing what does. For learning to happen, the loop obviously needs to contain useful information about how well a solution worked, and in which context. This also brings us back to issues about replicability.</p><p>A generally accepted starting point in understanding effectiveness and replicability of any interventions, is to understand what they were aboute.g. who needed to do what differently, when and where -and what was their content <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Hoffmann et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b190">Presseau et al., 2019)</ref>. A pertinent problem turned out to be that intervention content was rarely reported beyond terms with ambiguous meanings. For example, "counseling" could have included a wide variety of theoretically and procedurally distinct content (say, an educational lecture, providing feedback, or self-reflection activities), analysis of which under the same term might not make sense <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abraham &amp; Michie, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Michie et al., 2013)</ref>. An interest in clearer definitions led to several developments in the field regarding the components of interventions; including typologies, taxonomies and ontologies of behaviour change techniques, methods, interventions, their contexts and delivery styles, and so forth <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Hale et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Hollands et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Kok et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Michie et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">Norris et al., 2020)</ref>. The hope is that codifying factors about interventions provides us with a standardised vocabulary, which ought to facilitate scientific communication, replication efforts, and evidence synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b148">(Marques et al., 2021)</ref>. Note, though, that standardisation may not automatically lead to scientific progress, particularly in unstable environments such as a developing field <ref type="bibr" target="#b174">(Ogden, 2016;</ref>, and even more mature approaches like complex systems science have managed to proceed without having a singular consensus definition of complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(De Domenico et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam, 2020a</ref>).</p><p>An underlying idea is that the important parts of aforementioned intervention content are behaviour change principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Crutzen &amp; Peters, 2018</ref> also termed behaviour change techniques or behaviour change methods; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Kok et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Michie et al., 2013)</ref>, which are then turned into context-specific practical applications. For example, "self-monitoring of behaviour" is a behaviour change principle, and its application could be "in the end of each day, the intervention participants are asked to write down, whether or not they were able to behave according to a plan they had made, and reflect on underlying reasons". These principles are assumed to be the primary cause of an intervention's potency to affect different influences on behaviour -hence they are sometimes called the "active ingredients" of interventions -which then causes behaviour to change, which hopefully affects the problem at hand positively. One issue about this view is that it can lead one to consider individuals as passive recipients of intervention content, as addressed by Article I, where I participated in creating a list of techniques people can use to self-manage their own motivation and behaviour. In any case, the main argument for codifying intervention content is that if we knew what to expect regarding the effectiveness of behaviour change principles in contexts similar to ours, we could use the data to inform intervention design.</p><p>As an example of the intervention development process in the case of mitigating the effects of an airborne pathogen on society, scientists could identify a set of helpful solutions, such as the "Five Pillars" of prevention (World Health Network, 2023); e.g. ventilation and air purification, respirators, social distancing, testing, and vaccination. The behaviour change scientist could then identify 1) key environments related to these solutions, 2) people governing those environments, 3) people living in or using those environments and 4) key behaviours of controllers and users of the environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bartholomew Eldredge et al., 2016)</ref>. For example, controllers of environments could be the Minister of Health, member of city council, or the owner of a mall, while users of the environments could be community leaders and members. To exemplify behaviours, one could be "public health official monitors the supply of respirators in their health district", while another might be "visitors of public spaces wear respirators".</p><p>The process would continue by breaking these behaviours down into their more granular component parts; "sub-behaviours" of respirator wear in public spaces could entail e.g. acquiring a respirator, picking up a respirator when leaving home, and putting on a respirator when entering a public space. It could be discovered that among important influences to the latter, it matters whether one perceives that other people in the space expect them to wear the respirator <ref type="bibr" target="#b211">(Saurio et al., 2024)</ref> -that is, perceived social norms play a key role. Hence, as one part of the programme, the intervention planners could engage stewards of public spaces, encouraging them to influence this norm. These stewards could then work out, how to apply in their respective contexts the behaviour change principle "Information about others' approval" (defined as "Providing information about what others think about the person's behavior and whether others will approve or disapprove of any proposed behavior change"; <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Kok et al., 2016)</ref>. One such application could be hanging posters that say "Respirator-wearing encouraged here", another might be asking cashiers to wear a t-shirt that says "My respirator protects you, your respirator protects me" -but more out-of-the-box ideas can also surface through the very necessary process of stakeholder and community involvement.</p><p>In an ideal situation, then, the programme uses many behaviour change principles to affect the most influential and changeable antecedents or influences (such as perceived norms in this case) of sub-behaviours. Their effects could then be assessed. For example, do individuals who are exposed to a messaging campaign in a mall meaningfully change their perceptions of space-based social norms? And does the change in these perceptions explain a subsequent change in sub-behaviour, which could then explain changes in outcomes such as uptake of respirators in the society? When various interventions are available, one could evaluate whether applications of some (combinations of) behaviour change principles leads to more prominent changes than others do. If -and note the if -the situation did not change much over time, and if behaviour change principles were the driving force behind intervention effectiveness, a planner could use the past data as a reference value regarding what kinds of interventions could produce what kinds of effects in their own context. It might also be possible to gauge the pathways through which behaviour change principles influence successful behavioural change, e.g. does a particular programme work by changing social norms, or rather risk perceptions (never mind for now that these two are closely intertwined; we will return to this point later). Within single studies, these "mechanisms of change" are typically investigated with mediation or structural equation models <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Hagger, Moyers, et al., 2020</ref>; but see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Crutzen &amp; Peters, 2021)</ref>, often with an aim to identify one or more pathways that explain successful change in the target population. Article III explores some major caveats of such practice.</p><p>To summarise, the process above suggested by Intervention Mapping (Bartholomew Eldredge et al., 2016) and similar intervention development frameworks, implies interventions can be decomposed into parts, and once we understand the parts in their contexts, we can recombine them into effective interventions in novel contexts. <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref> displays a simplified schematic of an acyclic behaviour change diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b153">(Metz et al., 2022)</ref> that can be used to visualise the plan. Overall, the process represents a reductionist paradigm, which refers to the scientific framework of analysing and describing phenomena in terms of their constituent parts <ref type="bibr">(Kricheldorf, 2016, p. 63)</ref>. But as reductionism also carries significant negative connotations in the social sciences, we will refer to this as a decomposition-based approach, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Bar-Yam (2006)</ref>. Decomposition-based planning can be highly efficient when the system under scrutiny -be it e.g. a technological system, an individual, a community or a society -is governed by "component-dominant" dynamics: it is relatively predictable due to interdependencies being limited, controlled, and highly stable (for an overview, see e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Hilpert &amp; Marchand, 2018)</ref>. But when the system does not hold still or is dominated by interactions between components, the situation can change drastically. One such case is described next, when we delve into motivation systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.2">SLIPPERY MOTIVATION SYSTEMS</head><p>In the previous section, we discussed the process of affecting large problems by changing the human behaviours related to them, which in turn are affected by changing the influences on those behaviours. In a highly general model, such influences are broadly categorised into (physical and psychological) capabilities, opportunities (including physical and social resources), and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">(Michie et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b155">(Michie et al., , 2014</ref>. We will next examine one of these broad categories, motivation, through the lens of self-determination theory (R. M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017)</ref>, which informed thinking behind Articles I-III. In doing so, we evaluate the assumption of stability, which I already alluded to when describing the current practice of behaviour change research.</p><p>Self-determination theory proposes that there is more to motivation than how much of it a person possesses; according to the theory, there are different reasons behind putting efforts into tasks -ranging on a continuum from autonomous to controlled -and these reasons are predictive of behavioural performance and outcomes across various contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Gagné et al., 2022)</ref>. An additional category of amotivation describes the complete lack of motivation. Accordingly, an autonomously motivated individual can perform an activity for its own sake (intrinsic motivation), or because it is deemed personally important (integrated regulation), resulting in high quality adaptive performance of the behaviour.</p><p>In contrast, behaviour performed for instrumental reasons (external regulation), or for self-worth related concerns (introjected regulation), are examples of controlled motivation, and this generally results in poorer outcomes. Autonomous and controlled forms of motivation are not mutually exclusive, as different types of motivation may drive a behaviour simultaneously. Article III demonstrates, how such combinations of motivation types can co-exist and change over time. Within motivation literature, autonomous forms of motivation (i.e. intrinsic motivation and integrated regulation) appear to be consistently related to a higher quality of behaviour, performance, and well-being than controlled types of motivation -i.e. external and introjected regulations (R. M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017)</ref>. It has been suggested that this can be treated as logically necessary implication of "common sense theorems" <ref type="bibr" target="#b139">(Kristjánsson, 1993)</ref>, which can be interpreted to lend additional credence to the framework as a guide in practical decision making.</p><p>Beyond these types of motivation, self-determination theory emphasises that individuals are innately driven towards personal growth and actively seek ways to fulfill their basic psychological needs -autonomy, competence, and relatedness (R. M. <ref type="bibr" target="#b209">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017)</ref>. According to the theory, when people have the freedom to make choices and endorse their own actions (autonomy), feel effective and capable of mastering their environment (competence), and experience meaningful connections with others (relatedness), they are more likely to be motivated by the intrinsic value or importance of tasks. By catering to these needs, individuals can be encouraged to be more proactive and engaged in achieving personal and societal goals; satisfaction of these three needs is also associated with more self-determined motivation (Van den Broeck et al., 2016).</p><p>Self-determination theory posits itself within an organismic paradigm, which conceives of organisms as "complex structure[s] of interdependent elements whose relations are largely determined by their function in the whole", with internal states and an "inherent tendency to both maintain and enhance their complexity while preserving an overall integrity" (R. M. <ref type="bibr">Ryan &amp; Deci, 2017, p. 32)</ref>. If humans are autonomously adapting entities -which in seeking to fulfill their need to feel relatedness, interact with each other -a curious implication emerges on the macro-scale. If we accept that people differ from each other, are connected to each other, and are motivated to interact to satisfy their basic psychological needs, this implies they continuously adapt to and grow with their local interactions; that is, not only change but co-evolve (see <ref type="bibr">Boisot &amp; McKelvey, 2013, p. 65)</ref>.</p><p>This leads to a non-stationary world:</p><p>One of complex systems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.1">THE LINEAR BUMP IN AN IDIOGRAPHIC TURN, WITH A VACANCY FOR INTERACTION-DOMINANT DYNAMICS</head><p>To study dynamics in time, behaviour change investigators need to collect time series data; many repeated observations from the same system (usually an individual, but the unit of observation could be e.g. a community or a society). This data can be gathered with novel data collection technologies (e.g. mobile applications or sensors), with data collection commonly lasting approximately 1-2 weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b180">(Ottenstein &amp; Werner, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b184">Perski et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b251">Wrzus &amp; Neubauer, 2023)</ref>. This does not tell the whole story, though, as datasets with more than a thousand (bi-)daily within-individual observations have also been collected with traditional surveys or even spreadsheets (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Delignieres et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Heino, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b246">Wichers et al., 2016)</ref>. Such longer time series not only lend themselves to methods used in complex systems science <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Carello &amp; Moreno, 2005</ref>), but enable one to study, which assumptions about dynamics can be made reasonably and which not -and misplaced assumptions can lead to misplaced inferences. One demonstration of running tests on assumptions underlying time series data, is found in Article III, and a different but highly relevant approach in . These examples inspect, how amenable the psychological time series are to common statistical assumptions about e.g. linearity and stationarity, finding the assumptions quite dubious.</p><p>Ecological momentary assessment refers to using technology to prompt an individual to answer a survey in the midst of their daily life. In essence, a device or mobile app pings you -usually several times a day -and you respond to a set of questions querying your current state. This is also how the demonstration data for Article III was collected. As I am a firm believer that behaviour change scientists should eat their own cooking, I collected some 4800 time points of task-based momentary personal motivation data, which are shared in the OSF repository of the current work <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Heino, 2023)</ref>; the repository also includes a dataset of more than 300 weekly global work motivation assessments, which is expected to be less volatile (see discussion on scale-dependent complexity later). In recent decades, such methodology has become very mainstream; in health behaviours only, more than 600 studies have been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b184">(Perski et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>The increased interest in dynamics is closely related to what might be termed an "idiographic turn" in psychological research <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Hood, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b161">Molenaar, 2004)</ref>. It was strongly advocated by the heavyweight methodologist Peter Molenaar, who famously dictated that "psychological methodology will change profoundly due to the necessity to focus on intra-individual variation" <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">(Molenaar, 2007)</ref>. The rationale is largely motivated by the misalignment between intra-individual and inter-individual measurements, which severely hampers the applicability of research findings gathered from large samples to individual dynamics: What "works best on average", may be a poor fit to every individual, and group-level correlations are likely not informative of within-individual processes, nullifying many conventional research claims <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Fisher et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Hamaker, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b202">Rose, 2016)</ref>. To understand this, imagine a spreadsheet with 100 people as rows, and 100 daily motivation assessments as columns: if a statistic calculated for each row does not correspond to the statistic calculated for each column, the between-individual data (columns) cannot be used to make inferences about individuals. We can also visualise this in a multivariable case by using Cattel's (1988) data box, represented in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. While we usually only have a vertical slice or a few available -and hence the correspondence is difficult to evaluate -there is little reason to believe that within-individual and between-individual data of psychological processes would coincide <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Hamaker, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Cattel's data box. A: conventional research practice is to take few vertical slices, assessing many variables for many individuals, over few time points. B: idiographic research rather focuses on few horizontal slices, assessing many variables for few people, over many time points.</p><p>In many physical systems, we see a clear separation of scales, where behaviour and dynamics at one level have minimal or negligible interaction with those at another level, as is the case with quantum phenomena's meager influence on planetary motion. However, when it comes to human systems, this clear separation does not hold true. Human behaviour at an individual level can affect the group or even the societal level, and vice versa. This is a crucial point to comprehend: our emotions, decisions, and actions as individuals do not exist in a vacuum; they are influenced by and in turn influence the collective behaviour and cultural norms of the group or society we are a part of. In other words, the scales interact strongly <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Richardson et al., 2017)</ref>, and efforts to address larger-scale phenomena may require interventions pertaining to the smaller scale. The issues in using between-individual data to infer within-individual processes, is discussed later under ergodicity.</p><p>Although these developments in studying idiographic dynamics are welcome, they are being built on the foundations of component-dominant dynamics discussed earlier, with the assumption that the system is decomposable, and the impacts of different variables isolable. But this is only possible if the observations are independent and identically distributed, as linear models assume (Kelty-Stephen &amp; Wallot, 2017; Wallot &amp; Kelty-Stephen, 2017).</p><p>Complex systems, on the other hand, consist of many mutually interacting components, which combine to define the macro-scale state of the systemwhich again feeds back to constrain or enable the behaviour of the micro-scale variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Richardson et al., 2017)</ref>. When macro-scale states arising from micro-scale interactions are a defining feature of the system, it is called interaction-dominant <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Richardson et al., 2017;</ref>. In an interaction-dominant system described in Article III, it is less the components themselves that matter, and more the way in which the components are connected. We will return to this point when discussing how systems can be thought about, but make a note of it now, in order to better understand gaps in current practice.</p><p>At the time of writing, researchers in the fields of (social) psychology and behaviour change are almost exclusively studying time series with extensions (of extensions) of traditional linear models developed for component-dominant dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Bolger &amp; Zee, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b204">Ruissen et al., 2022)</ref>. They seem unaware of a very different world of tools, developed in other fields to study interaction-dominant dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Bradley &amp; Kantz, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Carello &amp; Moreno, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Goswami, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Guastello, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Marwan et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b149">Marwan &amp; Kraemer, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b214">Schiepek et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b247">Wijnants, 2014)</ref>. Even authoritative reviews describing "complex systems approaches" to psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Bringmann et al., 2023)</ref> limit themselves to methods that assume linear dynamics. This linear myopia is in stark contrast to the common understanding that outside the physical sciences, nonlinear systems are "the rule, not the exception" <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">(Strogatz, 2018)</ref> and "most of everyday life is non-linear" <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">(May, 1976)</ref>. In such a case, two time series can be positively correlated at one period in time, negatively in another, and uncorrelated in third, while at all times causally influencing each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b230">(Sugihara et al., 2012)</ref>. But not only that; the hegemony of linear models is also in stark contrast with much of psychological theorising <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Hilpert &amp; Marchand, 2018)</ref>. For example, few would contend that groups are simple sums of their constituents, or that change is always gradual or randomly varying around a static average, although these are hard-coded in practically all the pervasive models applied in the field. An alternative understanding is discussed under the sections on non-normality and non-linearity later on, but the various problems in using multilevel models and regression based approaches in this context are discussed elsewhere at length <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Crutzen &amp; Peters, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b192">Ram et al., 2017)</ref>.

Illustration of differences between component-dominant and interaction-dominant lenses on the behaviour change process. A: Schematic illustrating some fundamentals of conventional (component dominant) behaviour change thinking.

This property feeds back to constrain the dynamics that created it.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3.2">COMPLEXITY BEYOND THE INDIVIDUAL</head><p>To appreciate the importance of complexity and thinking beyond component-dominant dynamics, let us examine a principle from cybernetics known as Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ashby, 1991)</ref>. It posits that for a system to be effective in an environment, it must be capable of executing at least as many responses, as the challenges its environment (including, for example, other people, tribes, nations, the weather, or the job market) can produce.</p><p>Figure 3. Ashby's law of requisite variety. A: above the diagonal, a system has more responses than the environment has demands, and is able to operate in the environment -although farther away from the diagonal can imply inefficiency. Below the diagonal, the system will eventually disintegrate. B: passage of time tends to increase environmental demands, implying the necessity of increased response capacity. Adapted from Bar-Yam (2002; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Boisot &amp; McKelvey, 2013</ref>).</p><p>Of course, most people do not need to learn how to defend themselves in a hand-to-knife ground combat situation. This is because larger-scale societal structures shield us against most threats commonly only encountered by e.g. police officers or soldiers. The multiscale version of Ashby's law <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Allen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Bar-Yam, 2004;</ref> states, that when considering a larger-scale system such as the society, responses at each scale -individuals, communities, municipalities, the state -need to exceed the environmental demands for that scale, in order for the system to keep thriving. We will return to this point when defining complexity via the complexity profile.</p><p>Increased global interconnectedness increases the environmental demands for many systems. One symptom of this, relevant to behaviour change researchers, is the recognised need to reinvent how behavioural sciences are used in policy settings; from the "brittle" interventions of behavioural economics, to wider perspectives with more understanding of the systems we live in <ref type="bibr" target="#b215">Schmidt, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b216">Schmidt &amp; Stenger, 2021)</ref>. One reason is clear: conventional practice does not deal with extreme events ('Fat tails', which we will return to when discussing interconnectedness; <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">Taleb, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b243">Walker &amp; Kahneman, 2023)</ref>, and if extreme events become more common due to increased interconnectedness, conventional practice must change. This idea is represented in <ref type="figure">Figure 3B</ref>.</p><p>To summarise our story so far: Questions are being raised in social psychology about the role of (non-)replicability of research findings. It has been argued that using methodologies and theories rooted in component-dominant dynamics, when the system is driven by interaction-dominant dynamics, is a recipe for such poor replicability <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Gernigon et al., 2022;</ref>. Conventional behaviour change science relies on decomposition-based planning methods, which are efficient in component-dominant settings of low complexity and high stability. On the other hand, self-determination theory, complexity theory, and common sense indicate, that people are self-directed agents who interact with each other, and adapt to each others' behaviour. This creates change, which is not at all guaranteed to be slow nor gradual. To bypass problems of studying change with few time points only, researchers have turned to an idiographic, person-centered paradigm, while keeping to their traditional linear tools. But as the world grows even more complex, simplistic approaches to research and policy are expected to be in an increasingly awkward bind, motivating a call "to embrace 21st-century epistemology and methods to study how best to cope with uncertainty, unpredictability and non-linear causality" <ref type="bibr">(Greenhalgh, 2020, p. 2)</ref>.</p><p>The astute reader may have recognised that we have thus far danced around the issue of complexity, without really going into what it is we speak of.

In the context of behaviour change, the system in question may be e.g. an individual, a dyad, or a group such as a community or society. Considering an individual, each aspect of their psychosocial makeup can be regarded as a dimension in this state space. For example, a three-dimensional cube could visualise the dimensions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness need satisfaction. While visualising additional variables may be challenging, mathematically, any number of dimensions is possible. Although we typically limit variables to a theoretically guided set of the most crucial factors, it is essential to recognise that the full state space is not necessarily accessible to a system, and the accessible space (here called "space of possibilities") can contain sections towards which the system is drawn or attracted to. These regions, called "attractors," are also areas the system is comparatively less likely to leave, akin to gravitational pull of large planets. The pull of a particular attractor is determined by parameters which define how the variables are connected; in our case of the simple state space of three basic psychological needs, these parameters could relate to interaction styles.</p><p>Attractors are usually depicted as simplified pictures, where one or more valleys are separated by a hill, and a ball lying in the bottom of one of the valleys (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4)</ref>. The shape of the "terrain" is moulded by the aforementioned parameters that quantify the relationship between variables the state space consists of. At the hilltop lies something called a tipping point -nothing much seems to happen for a long time as the ball moves up the hill, until the tipping point is reached, and everything happens at once. Earlier, we briefly mentioned the concept of ergodicity; in an ergodic system, every state can be treated as equally plausible, as Article IV outlines. We will return to the concept of ergodicity as it is described in Article III, later on. Attractor landscapes offer a way to bridge quantitative studies and intuition, and in Article IV, they are developed for behaviour change contexts specifically. Here, I will summarise the idea of attractor landscapes while using them to understand more generic framework to analyse systems: state, scope, and resolution, which -as it will turn out -are crucial for understanding emergence in interaction-dominant dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Favela, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b208">A. J. Ryan, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">STATE</head><p>The first concept to consider is state, which refers to the current condition of a system at a given time. For instance, in a community, a state could be characterised by the satisfaction of the need for relatedness among its members. If this state is highly resilient, it can be visualised as a deep valley in the attractor landscape. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref> depicts such a single deep attractor, suggesting a form of stability. In stable contexts, as long as there are no sudden shifts and the landscape changes very slowly or not at all, past evidence is highly informative of the future. In such cases, research and analysis of the current situation are at their highest utility, and the efficiency gains from standardising intervention vocabulary (as done with behaviour change technique taxonomies; Michie et al., 2013) the largest. However, systems can have multiple discrete states, and instead of always residing in an equilibrium attractor, systems can transition to a new attractor state, as represented by the ball passing over a hill in the landscape (see <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>). For example, a community with a strong sense of connectedness might transition to a new, unfavourable state, where external influences (e.g. hybrid warfare; Heino et al, in prep.) cause polarisation and politicisation of issues formerly agreed upon.</p><p>Note that some attractors are more stable -"resilient", deep -than others, and change can be coupled with a shifting landscape, e.g. lowering of the hill between two attractors. This, in turn, can result in transient, rapid shifts between two or more attractors, which is observed as erratic fluctuations in time series measurements. Such a case was demonstrated in behaviour change context in other research I collaborated on, but which is not included in the current work <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Chevance et al., 2021)</ref>. In the study, participants of a weight loss intervention could fall into at least week-long periods of lower step counts; transition to these less active states was predicted by peaks of increased unpredictability of the daily steps. It also aligns with Kurt Lewin's description of a momentary "unfreezing", which takes place before change stabilises, mentioned in Article IV <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Cummings et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">SCOPE</head><p>The second concept needed for understanding systems is their scope. The scope of a system representation is like drawing a line around the parts we're interested in, separating them from everything else (A. J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Ryan, 2007)</ref>. This line forms the boundary between our system and everything else -its environment. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> shows how new attractors are revealed when the temporal or spatial scope of observation changes from that in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref>. For example, if we initially examined the satisfaction of the need for relatedness on a neighbourhood level, expanding the spatial scope to encompass the entire city may reveal additional attractors, such as non-randomly differential needs satisfaction across various districts. Similarly, extending the temporal scope may show how relatedness need satisfaction in a single community evolves over time, uncovering attractors that were not apparent in a shorter timeframe. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Increasing the scope under consideration reveals a wider terrain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">RESOLUTION</head><p>Lastly, we need to consider the resolution with which we observe the system; this resolution can be spatial (size of the entity observed e.g. number of people considered) or temporal (e.g. length of time something is observed). For some systems -e.g. that of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref> -when we blur the picture, not much changes. The complexity of this system remains the same across different levels of resolution. For example, observing a community's relatedness need satisfaction on a monthly basis versus a quarterly basis may not appear differently in the attractor landscape, or analysing the state of a very homogeneous community, might yield the same results as a randomly chosen sub-group of its constituents.</p><p>In contrast, some systems lose all structure when resolution is blurred; these have complexity on a small scale but not on a large scale. For instance, observing a community on a daily basis may reveal patterns of need satisfaction and need thwarting, but examining the community on an annual basis might not show any discernable order. Or there might be great heterogeneity in household-level data, while the municipal-level aggregations would look highly homogeneous.</p><p>Finally, the features of some systems change upon the blurring process; as seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, the number of distinguishable attractors decreases, but some form of the landscape remains until the blurring becomes extreme. These systems are said to have complexity across scales, and such systems are the main object of interest in complex systems science <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam, 2020a)</ref>. For instance, when looking at a community's relatedness need satisfaction on a weekly basis, some aspects of need thwarting and satisfaction might become less distinct, while broader patterns of cohesion and division could still be observed.</p><p>Why not always aim to keep the resolution extremely high? Maintaining an extremely high resolution is not always beneficial, as it may divert our attention from more important aspects of the system. Particularly if we are interested in societal scale phenomena and our temporal scope is measured in years, the minute-to-minute individual experiences play an exceedingly small role. Moreover, high-resolution data may be resource-intensive to collect and analyse, making it less feasible for addressing broader social issues. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. The top panel displays five attractors. Blurring out details leaves us with the lower panel, which only contains three meaningful attractors. This highlights the need to consider the appropriate level of resolution when analysing and addressing complex social issues. Having familiarised ourselves with the key terms of state, scope and resolution, we can now move on to a more granular description of complexity. The complexity profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Allen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bar-Yam, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, 2004a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam, 2020a</ref>) is a valuable tool for understanding behaviours of complex systems, and it also allows us to more clearly illustrate what we mean by complex systems. With its roots in information theory, it offers a rigorous backdrop for a visual representation of the relationship between the scale of observation (horizontal axis) and the variety of states that can be observed at each scale (vertical axis).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">ON NOT SHEDDING ONE'S SCALES: THE COMPLEXITY PROFILE</head><p>To begin, we define the complexity of a system as the length of the shortest possible description necessary to specify its multivariate space of possibilities <ref type="bibr">(Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam, 2020a, p. 3)</ref>; accordingly, the more potential states a system has, the more needs to be described, and hence the more complexity there is. Initially, one might find it puzzling that based on this definition of complexity, gas would appear more complex than humans: each molecule of a gas, moving randomly, demands its own description, while the correlated atoms within a human require less information to describe (if two things exhibit the same behaviour, we really only need to describe one behaviour). Yet, we instinctively perceive humans as more complex entities than gas. This seeming contradiction is reconciled through the concept of scale-dependent complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Allen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bar-Yam, 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">, 2004a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b220">Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam, 2020a</ref>: humans exhibit more complexity at larger scales, while gas exhibits more complexity at smaller scales.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">HEAVY METAL COMPLEXITY</head><p>To bring to life the concept of the scale-dependent complexity, imagine yourself observing a heavy metal concert in a local nightclub through your laptop, streaming feed from a roof-mounted video camera. Throughout the night, you can adjust the resolution of the feed you get on your laptop, but the scope -area covered by the camera -remains constant.</p><p>First, consider the period where the attendees are waiting for the band to take the stage. At high resolution, you notice an array of individual interactions, people engaged in various conversations, sipping drinks, and occasionally moving about. Any space made by a moving individual is quickly filled by another, creating a kind of equilibrium. As you gradually reduce the resolution, the individual actions quickly blend into an indistinct blur, radically reducing the variety of discernible behaviours (see black line in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. A schematic of the complexity profile for three types of prototypical systems. Independent systems (also referred to as random) demonstrate each component acting independently, devoid of any influence from other components. An example could be atoms in a gas or an audience awaiting the start of a concert. Coherent systems, on the other hand, display all components moving in synchrony. This is seen in cases like a cannonball in flight, where the position, orientation, and velocity of one part directly correspond to those of all other parts, or a crowd uniformly exiting a concert venue. Interconnected systems (also referred to as correlated) fall between these two extremes, wherein the behaviours of the system's components do have some influence on one another, but not so much that every component behaves identically: The structure of one part is related to, but does not strictly dictate the shape of the other parts. An example could be a concert audience displaying different behaviours within different clusters. These interconnected systems are what we call complex. It is important to note that any system could potentially exhibit aspects of each of these types at different times. See text and Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam (2020a) for details.</p><p>Second, consider the period that takes place after the band strikes the first chords. Despite the reduced level of detail, some diverse responses of the audience remain visible. Upon lowering the resolution further, clusters of stationary people at the edges of the screen become a vague mass, while the more animated concert-goers near the stage form a dynamic, unified movement of fists in the air. Brief, intense mosh pits form and dissolve, their energy detectable even at much lower resolution. Interruptions, such as stage banter, punctuate the music and stand out starkly even at the broadest of scales -that is, detectable even at extremely low resolution settings (see turquoise line in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).</p><p>Finally, as the concert comes to a close, the scene changes once again. Our third scenario is when the final song fades, the lights come up, and a singular purpose takes hold: everyone heads to retrieve their coats. No matter the resolution, the image before you is dominated by a single, coherent behaviour -moving towards the exit (see blue line in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">A POST-RECITAL DEBRIEFING</head><p>As is customary after a concert visit, we can next sit down to discuss the madness we witnessed. Some key points deserve highlighting. Firstly, during each of the three periods we observed at the concert, more behaviours were visible at high resolution (small scale) than at low resolution (large scale). This underscores that systems tend to exhibit less complexity at larger scales, where most small-scale details merge into an indistinguishable blur. It is often these larger-scale patterns that hold the most significance, and where problem definitions should start from <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam, 2020a)</ref>. It could be objected that intuitively, phenomena at smaller scales are less complex than those on larger scales. But this is true only if we reduce the scope while keeping the resolution high: individual behaviours in a community are less complex than those in a society, because there are much fewer individuals in a community than in a society (i.e. the scope is smaller to start with).</p><p>Secondly, recall that resolution is not just spatial, like selecting a quality setting on YouTube (a video hosting platform in existence at time of writing); it can also be temporal. This can be likened to the increasing or decreasing sampling rates available through granular time series collected by ecological momentary assessment, as discussed earlier. Article III <ref type="figure">(Figure 3</ref>) demonstrates a case where an ill-chosen sampling regime (i.e., poor resolution) leads to false conclusions.</p><p>Thirdly, if we were to average over the periods we observed or capture a single screenshot, we would glean very limited information about the phenomenon of heavy metal concerts. During the period before the band comes on stage, behaviours might be "independent and identically distributed" (therefore ergodic)enough for us to apply traditional statistical methods. However, when the music is playing, such methods would prove insufficient, and during the final stage where everyone is leaving, they would be unnecessary.</p><p>Fourth, recall that the multiscale Ashby's law suggests that the system's potential behaviours -or complexity -should match or exceed the complexity of the environmental states to which it must respond across all scales or resolution settings. However, if we overlook the large-scale threats, our smaller-scale actions may be of limited effect. This concept can be likened to a ship with multiple leaks. Addressing minor leaks, while important, will be in vain if a gaping hole in the hull is ignored. Hence, to navigate successfully in a complex environment, it is crucial to first identify the largest-scale behaviours; smaller scales are important depending on how much they enable or constrain the larger scale, although neglecting them while taking care of the large-scale factors will lead to consistent errors in system functioning. In our earlier example of a concert, this would translate as addressing the factors which influence whether music will continue playing; details such as the quality of ingredients in drinks served, matter little if there is a considerable risk of power outage or fire. At the time of writing, a considerable burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection management is considered "individual responsibility", which starkly contradicts this principle.</p><p>More specifically, in the example of disease transmission, large scale phenomena might include local rates of growth or decline in new cases, as well as the rate of infections spreading from one region to another <ref type="bibr" target="#b221">(Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam, 2020b</ref>). Smaller-scale actions can be included in analysis based on how much they influence the larger-scale trends. This might involve treating different regions dynamically based on their infection status and implementing travel restrictions at intermediate scales, rather than locking down the entire country as a whole (Oliu-Barton &amp; Pradelski, 2021; Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam, 2020b). Just as you would not ignore a gaping hole in a ship or a power outage in a concert, in a pandemic, it's vital to address the large-scale behaviours first before refining the smaller-scale details.</p><p>I described in the introduction that in social psychology a multiscale view is not optional. The complexity profile directs our attention to where we can expect the most complexity. When your scope is the whole system, and you only look at it on the lowest resolution to hide all but the largest scale factors, things can suddenly become simple: you put out a fire, and you do not need to worry about which specific items in your house will be lost. In the context of intervention planning, behaviour change diagrams (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>), this is understood in starting from the problem (e.g. obesity or quality of life) and considering the most important influences on the problem -not starting from a comprehensive list of solutions. On the other hand, as Yaneer Bar-Yam (Bar-Yam, 2004b, p. 227) put it: "A chain always breaks first in one particular link, but if the weight it is required to hold is too high, failure of the chain is guaranteed". Interventions that fail to counter the complexity of their environment at all scales, will always end up failing in different places. For example, no amount of motivation self-management interventions can help a worker, if their job demands chronically exceed their resources. This understanding can help researchers and practitioners make informed choices about which methods to employ based on the scale and complexity of the system under study.</p><p>In the complexity profile, we have thus far kept the scope constant, while changing the resolution and observing how many states we can detect. Next, we will see what happens when we change the scope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A PROPOSAL FOR UNDERSTANDING BEHAVIOUR CHANGE</head><p>Now that we understand social systems to be delineated but not isolable parts of the universe, and complexity as a scale-dependent description of the space of possibilities for the system, it is easier for us to move onto what complexity means for behaviour change. Article III defines behaviour change as processes that a form a complex interconnected system, not restricted to linear dynamics, and contextually specific to each individual -although, as seen in Article IV, the society can also be an "individual" (i.e. unit of observation for idiographic research). The first word to notice from this definition of behaviour change is process; any discussion of change must invoke the temporal dimension. Dynamics happen in time, but this is seldom discussed in psychological literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b200">(Roe, 2014)</ref>, although examples exist in e.g. cognitive science <ref type="bibr" target="#b247">(Wijnants, 2014)</ref>. This also means invoking a process ontology (van Geert, 2019); understanding the objects of study as intertwined processes instead of some fixed substance. In this sense, the circles in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> can be interpreted as ongoing processes instead of static entities. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> presents an overview of how some concepts relevant to complex systems, can be understood with the conceptual model of attractor landscapes (see also Article IV). Individual level: The responses to a behavior change intervention may not be normally distributed -some individuals may show extremely large or small changes. Group level: Adverse events faced by a community do not follow a bell curve, where new extreme observations are drawn to the meaninstead, it must be expected that old records will be broken by wide margins (also known as "regression to the tail"; Flyvbjerg, 2020).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-linearity (Article III):</head><p>Outputs are not linearly proportional to inputs, and large changes may not necessarily result from large events. In an attractor landscape, large or small pushes may result in large changes depending on whether the system sits on a tipping point -depicted by a "hill" on the landscape -or not.</p><p>Individual level: Every additional self-management technique (see Article I) a person takes up, does not lead to a proportional increase well-being, whereas a particular one can be more influential than all others combined. Group level: Social norms and behaviours can shift rapidly, leading to large-scale behaviour change after long periods of apparent stability. Some examples include norms mask wearing, indoor smoking, and same-sex marriage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-stationarity (Article III):</head><p>Systems are not static but evolve over time. In an attractor landscape, this implies that the "valleys" and "hills" shift in time.</p><p>Individual level: An individual's preferences, habits, and circumstances change over time, affecting the accessibility of some behavioral states and responses to interventions. Group level: The demographic makeup, resources and social norms in a community can shift over time instead of fluctuating around some single long-term average.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-homogeneity (Article III):</head><p>Systems may show variability across different areas or (clusters of) components. In an attractor landscape, different "valleys" can have different properties.</p><p>Individual level: Inferences regarding the meaningfulness of capability, opportunity and motivation factors to behaviour change, differ across sub-behaviours and may not generalise from one observation period to another. Group level: Different subgroups within a larger group may have drastically different needs or respond differently to interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Non-ergodicity (Articles III-IV):</head><p>A system is ergodic if its time-averaged behavior is equivalent to its ensemble-averaged behavior. In an attractor landscape, attractors which cannot be escaped from, cause the system to become non-ergodic.</p><p>Individual level: The long-term behavior of a single individual cannot be inferred from the average behavior observed across many individuals. Group level: A group's long-term behavior cannot be inferred from the average behavior observed across multiple similar groups.</p><p>Given its particular gravity, we will next discuss interconnectedness at some length.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">THE WEBS THAT BIND US: GREETING EMERGENCE AND INTERCONNECTEDNESS</head><p>To recap, in our discussion, scope referred to the components included in our system's description, while resolution denoted the level of granularity with which these components are described. State was essentially a snapshot, capturing specific values of these components at a given moment.</p><p>The concept of emergence holds a significant place in the study of complex systems. Here, we define it as a process that gives rise to "emergent properties", novel features that become evident as we broaden the scope under consideration (A. J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b208">Ryan, 2007)</ref>. Transitioning from observing a smaller set of components, such as an individual, to a larger set, such as a community, allows us to identify new behaviours or properties. Take social norms as an example. They are not a property of any single individual, but rather a collective characteristic that emerges from the interactions among individuals. These emergent properties cannot be properly understood by examining the individual components, and are caused by the interaction-dominant dynamics discussed earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Favela, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>To illustrate with a practical example, let us consider the example of implementing mass testing to curtail or eliminate a pandemic, which has been modeled to be a highly cost-effective public health action <ref type="bibr" target="#b188">(Philippe et al., 2023)</ref>. Suppose a municipality introduces a policy encouraging households to conduct daily saliva-based tests as part of their morning routine, strongly recommending self-isolation for positive results. The impact of this policy within any single municipality might be substantial, but the effect on the national scope is not a simple sum of the municipality effects. For instance, with the nationwide implementation of mass testing in all municipalities, we might witness a more rapid decline in infection rates than anticipated based on the municipal-level data alone. This accelerated decrease could be an emergent property arising from a variety of factors such as increased collective responsibility, (inter)national media attention, more efficient resource allocation, or enhanced data for tracking and managing the spread of the virus. These factors, invisible at a more constrained municipal level observation, come to the fore and exert significant influence when the scope is expanded. This is an example of how macro-scale patterns, which feed back to affect the micro-scale dynamics, can emerge when we increase our scope.</p><p>Emergence and interconnectedness are inexorably linked. Consider water, which can exist in different states, such as ice and steam, and carbon monoxide, a gas with entirely different components. Although ice and steam share the same components (i.e., water molecules), they appear very different due to the differential connections between the molecules -whereas carbon monoxide, a completely different substance, appears very similar to steam. This is because molecules in steam and carbon monoxide move independently, whereas those molecules of ice are bound together. This example demonstrates that the connections between components can be as important, or even more so, than the components themselves, and connections are not present in components, but between them -requiring an increase in scope and hence allowing emergence. It should alert us to the limitations of the state of the art discussed in the introduction, which nearly exclusively focused on the components (e.g. behaviours, sub-behaviours, influences on behaviours, behaviour change principles).</p><p>The following story further illustrates the significance of connections in complex social psychological systems: When I learned about how small actions in interconnected systems can cause large cascading domino effects, I developed a particular affinity for helping my friends move. It is a significant life change they are going to go through regardless of your participation, and the potential for unexpected negative consequences of well-meaning actions is minuscule -while you personally are rewarded with free physical activity (pizza and beer are a bonus, too). One common task in such situations is moving a large bed, which typically requires the coordinated effort of two individuals. The key here is not just the presence of two people, but their ability to communicate and work together effectively -blindfolded and in the absence of a coordinating third person, the bed would hardly find its way into the rented van.</p><p>In this example, we can see a parallel between the ice, steam, and carbon monoxide scenarios and the bed-moving task: connections between components matter. Changing the individual components (here: replacing the bed-carrying individuals with other people) may not result in noticeable differences, while altering the connections (here: allowing or forbidding communication) can lead to substantial changes in performance. Both research and practical experience demonstrate that a team's performance can be significantly affected by the connections and collaboration between its members. An example from the domain of behaviour change would be the concept of "activity spaces", which aim to change interactions not individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Hawe et al., 2009)</ref> The potential for interactions to dominate over individuals is essential to understand about interconnectedness, and presents a major divergence from decomposition-based behaviour change thinking. It also brings us to the concept of a network, introduced in Article II.</p><p>The concept of networks, as demonstrated in Article II and <ref type="figure">Figure 2 (B-D)</ref>, helps us understand interconnectedness, a key feature of complexity outlined in Article III. A network is made up of nodes, usually represented as circles, connected by links, also known as "edges." These links can represent various relationships, such as friendships in social networks or even flight routes between cities. Networked systems are not independent but interconnected.</p><p>Interconnectedness can mean not only that people are connected to and affected by other people, but that cognitions and behaviours form systems of feedback, which may impede or enable behaviour change. Such feedback may be accelerating like an arms race pushing the system to new attractors, or balancing such as a thermostat, which carves the current attractor deeper (see Article IV).</p><p>At the time of writing, psychological network analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Borsboom et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Epskamp &amp; Fried, 2018</ref>) has become extremely popular. It typically uses links to represent estimates of linear bivariate relationships that remain between two variables, after trying to account for all the other relationships in the network. Article II evaluated the self-reported enactment of behaviour change techniques -such as those in the compendium of techniques for individuals to influence their motivation and behaviour, which was developed in Article I -modelling them as a network where nodes represented techniques, physical activity behaviours, and autonomous and controlled motivation. This network representation directs attention to the holistic pattern of interactions between variables, rather than focusing on how variables are connected to an outcome in isolation.</p><p>From Article II's psychological network demonstration, I learned that the best use for such a network might be engaging stakeholders in a needs assessment exercise <ref type="bibr" target="#b183">(Panneer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b194">Reed et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b228">Soyster &amp; Fisher, 2019)</ref>. That is, there was too much uncertainty in assumptions regarding self-report measures and distribution shapes, as well as the assumptions made in linear models (particularly independent and equally distributed data), to draw solid conclusions about the phenomenon at hand. Hence, in Articles III-IV, a recurrence network approach was adopted, where time points are nodes, while links represent repeated occurrences of specific multivariate system states. As the aim of this summary is to give the reader a general-level understanding of complexity in behaviour change, I will omit as peripheral the details of the methodology behind particular empirical demonstrations of complexity concepts made in the articles. I would also like to emphasise that the recurrence network approach is only one example of a complexity-informed analysis technique; a screwdriver, not a toolbox.</p><p>Let us return to the topic at hand. We previously discussed how the decomposition-based planning process maps key contexts, people, and behaviours related to larger societal outcomes, identifying influences on behaviours and modulating each influence with the aim of affecting the behaviours -and eventually the overarching problem. But even in the simplistic case of <ref type="figure">Figure 2C</ref>, where four environmental conditions and seven human behaviours are interconnected, there are in total 40 quadrillion 1 causal patterns -different configurations of links -that would need to be evaluated, if we were required to truly understand the problem at hand (see <ref type="bibr">Boisot &amp; McKelvey, 2013, p. 80)</ref>. Even ruling out 99.99% of these, we still end up with 4 trillion patterns, which may differ between individuals or communities and change over time (see Article III).</p><p>Modern science has developed ways to deal with such "epistemological pessimism" -as one prominent behaviour change researcher dubbed it -we will outline those briefly towards the end. But the first step is to admit, that the relationship between macro-level outcome patterns and the behaviours of the micro-level components may not straightforward, and can be sufficiently nuanced so as to be fundamentally out of reach of even the biggest of big data (Bar-Yam, 2016a, 2016b), leading to irreducible uncertainty. I want to emphasise this point, as the success of classical physics made many optimistic that we could eventually learn everything there is to know about behaviours of particular systems. More recently, it has been accepted that in the high-complexity interaction-dominant regimes, there are things that cannot be known for many or any time horizons <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">(Strogatz, 2018)</ref>. The idea of multiscale emergence is illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. A generic model for understanding multiscale problems with human action as a key component -the main interest of behaviour change science. The outcome of interest (black circle; e.g. a society able to dynamically counter pandemic threats) represents an emergent property of a network of smaller scale outcomes (grey circle; e.g. community and organisational scale enablement of precautionary action). Each node of this intermittent scale, in turn, is the emergent property of a network of interwoven smaller scale factors, which enable or constrain positive change.</p><p>Note that the network dynamics at the lower scale interact to create the larger scale dynamics, but the larger scale also imposes "downwards causation", constraining the lower scale dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Richardson et al., 2017</ref>).</p><p>An example of multiscale emergence would be individuals in a hospital, who form a multidisciplinary team of medical experts. The team's performance is different to that of the individuals working in isolation, in part because team membership constrains the individuals actions to an extent -they need to participate in team meetings, for example. This is a simple example of "downwards causation", where higher-scale dynamics constrain the lower scale actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b196">(Richardson et al., 2017)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">PROPERTIES FOR CONSIDERATION IN A COMPLEX SYSTEMS APPROACH TO BEHAVIOUR CHANGE SCIENCE</head><p>Interconnectedness is tied to some properties, namely non-normality, non-linearity, non-stationarity, non-homogeneity, and non-ergodicity, which are seldom discussed in behaviour change. They can be intuitive to practitioners, but largely absent from discussions involving quantitative analysis. I propose to bring them to the forefront when discussing behaviour change, as they enable us to appreciate the richness and diversity of behaviour change processes, as well as the unique challenges and opportunities they present.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">NON-NORMALITY: BEYOND STRAIGHT LINES</head><p>Interconnected systems often defy the assumption of independent and identically distributed data points, which is ubiquitous in behaviour change research. Normal distributions arise universally in systems, which consist of independent components. Interconnectedness can foster non-normality, as interconnected elements are capable of producing outcomes which feed back to each other and thus diverge from the traditional bell curve. The skew can be extreme, such as in the case of pandemics or wars, where a single observation to carry more importance than all the others combined <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Cirillo &amp; Taleb, 2016</ref>. In survey research, though, the person who would have answered "5000" in the 5-point Likert scale had they had the option, is treated like everyone else who ended up answering "5", and hence not of great gravity. Such observations routinely get discarded as outliers or measurement errors, ignoring Scott E. Page's admonition that for societal change to happen, "all it takes is a few angry people and a lot of positive feedbacks" <ref type="bibr">(Understanding Complexity, 2009)</ref>. In Article II, practically none of the many distributions inspected resembled a Gaussian, and means were judged to be a poor description of their shape.</p><p>Multivariate normality also means that changes abide by smooth Gaussian dynamics with no sudden jumps from one level to the next, as when crossing a tipping point on an attractor landscape to arrive at a radically different state. This has important practical consequences, as "Very much of what seems stable and rigid and reliable eventually wiggles, wobbles and falls down if you watch it long enough" <ref type="bibr">(Kelty-Stephen, 2018, p. 12)</ref>. This description of effects where the system can radically change its state, brings us to the next property.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">NON-LINEARITY: THE POWER OF (DE-)AMPLIFIED EFFECTS</head><p>Quantitative models in behaviour change research almost exclusively assume that increases in an input should be followed by proportional increases in output. A non-linear effect of an action happens any time, when one unit of increase in the action does not lead to a proportional effect of the action.</p><p>Interconnectedness can breed non-linearity, as the relationships between intertwined components may no longer be simply additive or directly proportional. Large changes are not necessarily caused by special eventscrossing an innocuous tipping point can be enough -and long periods of apparent calm can be followed by periods when everything changes at once (think of the last straw breaking the camel's back). Doubling the times you tell the same joke to the same audience, does not double the laughs, and while most times you fall from 10 m you die, falling from 1 m does not make you 1/10th dead <ref type="bibr" target="#b231">(Taleb, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Article III)</ref>.</p><p>In behaviour change, proportional effects should be treated as one case, not the universal one. Note, that non-linearity involves not only the functions not described by a straight line, including what is understood wit the term "non-linear trend", but also "non-linear dynamics", which refer to complex behaviours of interconnected systems, where outputs are not proportional to inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b229">(Strogatz, 2018)</ref>. Non-linearity was the norm in long time series of motivation examined in Article III, as was non-stationarity, which we turn to next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">NON-STATIONARITY: EMBRACING CHANGE AND EVOLUTION</head><p>Non-stationarity, which arises when people develop and change unpredictably over time, is often neglected in behaviour change research that assumes static averages, deviance of which is understood as normally distributed error. We already briefly discussed non-stationarity as a consequence of observing humans as self-organising agents. Non-stationarity appears when people develop and change over time, in ways that are often unpredictable and inconsistent over time frames, hence often not well described by (deviations from static) averages. It can be visualised as an attractor landscape changing its shape, allowing for new states to be accommodated.</p><p>The available methods to deal with non-stationary multivariate dynamics in psychology have thus far mostly consisted of Time Varying Auto Regressive (TV-AR; Haslbeck et al., 2020) models, which are limited to linear dynamics and very short time scales -usually only accounting for the effect of a single previous time point. On the other hand, psychological time series have been demonstrated to contain "long-term memory", where values from the distant past influence those of the present, as well as non-stationary autocorrelation functions, where the effect of the past varies in time .</p><p>In an open, interconnected system, non-stationarity can be the norm, with the system's dynamics constantly evolving based on the interplay of its elements under adaptation pressures of the environment. The attractor landscape keeps shifting -and with it, the future. Much can be said about implications to traditional randomised controlled designs. Stable, even complicated settings can be much more easily controlled, whereas artificially tight control of complex systems can lead to unwanted consequences, making it necessary to allow for fluctuation and instability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Bar-Yam, 2004b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b236">Taleb &amp; Blyth, 2011)</ref>. Combined with context-dependence, where the presence or absence of an effect can be determined by the idiographic history of the people partaking an intervention, this presents problems to interventions trying to uncover a general, causal, unbiased, and stable effect size estimate <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Greenhalgh et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b197">Rickles, 2009)</ref> In contrast, the most successful known way of providing the necessary variety to find solutions to evolving challenges, is to counter evolution with evolution (Bar-Yam, 2006); we will return to this point when discussing implications for practice.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">NON-HOMOGENEITY: APPRECIATING THE MOSAIC OF VARIATIONS</head><p>Interconnectedness can lead to non-homogeneity, when there are clusters of components weakly connected to outside the cluster. The characteristics of the system can thus diverge across its different parts (say, communities), potentially making averages over the whole system meaningless. This diversity is invaluable as it produces the variety necessitated by Ashby's law, making the system less vulnerable to abrupt collapse (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b213">Scheffer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">and Figure 8 in Taleb et al., 2014)</ref>. But, as we saw with scale-dependent complexity, this also means a tradeoff where the system is less able to perform large-scale actions efficiently. The most important implications of non-homogeneity arise when it is combined with non-stationarity, leading to non-ergodicity -which I have mentioned earlier, but finally have the chance to discuss next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.5">NON-ERGODICITY: WHEN PATHS DIVERGE</head><p>In the introduction, we briefly discussed how an ergodic system is one where we can draw inferences about the components, not only by studying the components in time, but by comparing the components -which can be assumed to just reside in different points of the same path -to each other (see Article III). In Cattel's data box of <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, comparing horizontal and vertical slices would produce similar results. An ergodic system visits all states equally in the long run, so if individuals were homogeneous and the process stationary <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">(Molenaar, 2008)</ref>, we would not need the cumbersome process of following individuals in time; we could just take a correlation based on a cross-section of many individuals, and infer that the correlation holds within individuals in time. Given that this is seldom the case, between-individual results from correlations, regression, factor analysis, structural equation modeling or psychological network analysis cannot unproblematically be used to infer within-individual processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Brandt &amp; Morgan, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Hamaker, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Hamaker, , 2023</ref>.</p><p>The concept of a 'space of possibilities', which describes all states a system can reside in, provides a useful way to understand ergodicity. Consider <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 9A</ref>. Here, each tile represents a potential state. The system's current state is marked by a red dot, and this dot can move freely across the entire grid. Because the dot has an equal chance of landing on any tile, over time, each tile will be visited with the same frequency. Thus, the long-term average state of a single trajectory mirrors the average state of all trajectories at a given point in time. environmental pressures, and visit all tiles equally. B) An attractor appears, which "traps" some trajectories entering its basin of attraction (darker blue). C) The space contains an additional attractor with e.g. an extreme risk (orange tile); trajectories that land there, halt permanently and the system is no longer ergodic, as time averages and ensemble averages diverge. Dashed trajectory remains at risk of being pushed to destruction, despite spending long periods in its characteristic area. D) The space seen from the perspective of the system, as in the policy making context: only the adjacent possible states can be observed. See text for details. <ref type="figure">Figure exapted</ref> from <ref type="bibr">Lewin (1951, p. 92)</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 9B</ref>, an attractor -located towards the bottom-right of the starting point -appears. Now, some trajectories will get caught in the attractor's influence; this is still an ergodic situation, as the disproportionate time spent in the attractor by any single trajectory, will be reflected in the number of trajectories in the ensemble at any given time. On the other hand, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 9C</ref> includes a state from which the system cannot escape once it has been entered (orange tile). Some common examples include bankruptcy and death <ref type="bibr" target="#b234">(Taleb, 2020)</ref>. Now the system is no longer ergodic; if 50% of the ensemble land on the orange tile and get destroyed, it does not mean that individual trajectories are 50% destroyed -they either are operational or not, and no zombies exist.</p><p>An example of the orange-tile scenario would be, where an individual or society encounters a virulent pathogen and fails to respond effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">(Rauch &amp; Bar-Yam, 2006)</ref>. As long as this state is available, every trajectory will eventually land there and become immobile <ref type="bibr" target="#b237">(Taleb et al., 2014)</ref>. If this was the human civilisation's space of possibilities, and the civilisation was temporarily trapped in the bottom-right attractor (dashed trajectory), calls to blue-ify the orange tile might be brushed away as wasteful -with eventual, permanent consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b235">Taleb et al., 2020)</ref>. Note that the fact that such a jump from one attractor to the next has not happened before, says nothing about its future potential; had it happened, this discussion would not take place. This is a testament to the poverty of past samples in fat-tailed phenomena and non-ergodic environments. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 9D</ref> presents a scenario that resembles the more realistic situation policy making faces, as the known space of possibilities (tiles 1-6) is limited to "adjacent possible" <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Björneborn, 2020)</ref> states. The grey tiles (7) represent states that cannot be known until the system moves closer to them. Tiles 1-5 represent adjacent states that allow the system to continue its existence, but the system cannot currently access tiles 4-5 without excessive time or energy cost (red borders indicate barriers to entry). Tile 4 is accessible via tile 3, but the system's ability to reach it might change over time, if and when the space of possibilities changes dynamically over time. In such non-stationary situations, strategies that depend on meticulous, long-term planning can consistently fail: the conditions that plans were based on, are there no longer during their implementation. The detailed 5-year plans of the Soviet Union are a prime example.</p><p>I end this section with some more specific ways non-ergodicity affects behaviour change research. First, understanding individual differences and personalising interventions: Non-ergodicity in behaviour change research underscores the importance of considering individual differences and trajectories instead of group-level statistics. This not only influences the understanding of individual responses to interventions, but also suggests that interventions should be specifically tailored to individuals rather than adopting a one-size-fits-all approach. Acknowledgement of non-ergodicity implies more personalised and effective behaviour change interventions that take into account unique patterns and time-varying characteristics of individual behaviour.</p><p>Second, there are implications to measurement and interpretation of behaviour change: Due to idiographic variations over time, sparse measurements do not capture true behavioural patterns of individuals in non-ergodic contexts, and the sparseness of within-individual temporal data cannot be replaced by increasing the number of individuals, as is common practice when applying multi-level models <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">(Ram et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, multiple measurements (e.g. &gt; 3) ought to be done based on the the time scale of phenomenon in question <ref type="bibr" target="#b192">(Ram et al., 2017)</ref>. If, say, four was chosen, and a motivational state was expected to change on a weekly basis, four within-individual measures per week ought to be taken to capture a single state; likewise, a multi-year study of annually shifting global motivation states ought to sample four times per annum. Conversely, a weekly survey would be expected to be informative of monthly state changes.</p><p>Furthermore, understanding non-ergodicity helps in more nuanced interpretation of research findings. Even if an intervention shows effectiveness on average, it does not mean it will be effective for each individual, underscoring the need for caution in generalising findings. While this may seem obvious, it is still common practice to aggregate-then-analyse results regarding influences on behaviour, while an analyse-then-aggregate strategy -where individual time series are first analysed separately, then combined with other individuals -would be warranted <ref type="bibr" target="#b203">(Rose et al., 2013)</ref>. In other words, non-ergodicity implies that mechanisms of interventions ought not to be studied by averaging heterogenous individuals, but by following them in time, making a model of each individual, and only then looking for patterns that repeat across individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">BEYOND EPISTEMOLOGICAL PESSIMISM: ADDRESSING COMPLEX PROBLEMS</head><p>An actor in a complex system controls almost nothing but influences almost everything.</p><p>-Scott E. Page <ref type="bibr">(Understanding Complexity, 2009)</ref> The introduction of irreducible complexity in cause-and-effect relationships -interaction-dominant dynamics -may seem daunting, if one is bent on discovering only "A causes B"-type of relationships between static entities. In interconnected human systems, these entities -be they e.g. attitudes or people -change, and so do their interrelationships. It can seem daunting if one expects the environmental agents identified during the intervention mapping process, to actually control the environments, as depicted in the Scott E. Page quote above. It can also seem daunting if one is exclusively committed to problem solving approaches, which rely on first decomposing the issue into parts, using analysis only to arrive at solutions to each part, and subsequently implementing the solutions successfully. Some areas of psychology have resolved this conundrum by shifting focus on attractor shifts and the related instability indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b176">(Olthof, 2023)</ref> But luckily, scale-dependent complexity provides some relief to this anxiety: not everything is equally complex, and particularly at the largest scales, there may be less possibilities to mull over.</p><p>My proposal is, that behaviour change research ought to consider its object of study as a system of systems, which has states that can be inspected by first fixing a scope. This system, be it a society consisting of communities consisting of people, or a school consisting of classrooms of people likely has properties of complex interconnected systems described in the previous section, and can be evaluated by changing the resolution, starting from the coarsest and including more granular factors to the extent that they affect the coarsest-scale description. This touches base with the conventional behaviour change planning process, where a societal problem is first identified, and then environmental conditions as well as human actions contributing to the problem are included in the consideration -to the extent that they affect the societal problem.</p><p>The conventional process continues by mapping "causes of causes" until scales where solutions are implementable, are found. This is generally the level of very granular and tangible behaviours, such as "hospital administrator lists ways to reduce hospital-acquired infections in their context", or "civilians put on respirators when entering a public space". This is also very small scale; if our scope is the society, we need extremely high resolution to observe it. In my proposal, not everything is complex, but phenomena at this scale should particularly be assumed to be so: interacting, with potential of multiple attractor states (see Article IV), non-normally distributed, non-linear, non-stationary, meaningfully differing among individuals, and non-ergodic (see Article III) -unless shown otherwise.</p><p>In congruence with Ashby's law, planning for behaviour change on the aforementioned small scale generally needs to be adaptable, experimental and relatively short-term: when temporal scope extends, emergence can wash away a plan's feasibility. Continuous, relatively high-frequency monitoring is required, so that the plans can be adapted when the landscape shifts. It is also the case, that when a situation is non-stationary, past evidence may not be informative of the future, and hence analysis without some form of intervention or change effort is of limited use <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Mark &amp; Snowden, 2017)</ref>. If this scale is determined important for the larger scale issue that is to be solved, here is where we might do well to hand the planning to more "local" autonomous agents, and this is where the compendium of self-enactable techniques to manage one's own motivation and behaviour (Article I) could come in. If community processes -i.e. social support -could be leveraged to further enable people to take up these techniques, they could work as an additional source for variety of responses the system has available (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">DISTINGUISHING COMPLEX FROM ORDERED REGIMES</head><p>As we have seen, all this does not mean everything in behaviour change is intractably complex. For any given problem, we can, in fact, try to disentangle ordered problem solving regimes from complex ones, in which the environment has a larger variety at its disposal, and hence any system residing in the environment needs to be able to respond accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Boisot &amp; McKelvey, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">European Commission: Joint Research Centre et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Mark &amp; Snowden, 2017)</ref>. Facets of problems pertaining to the ordered regime are characterised by slow trends in attractor landscapes, with few large-scale causes that have relatively predictable influences. These would more generally be found in the large-scale part of the complexity profile we visited earlier. In such situations we can focus on uniform, large-scale action, exploiting what we know while monitoring the context, in order to detect regime change rather early than late. For example, a city may have discovered some particularly innovative and fruitful ways to engage its inhabitants in city planning, and once the necessary support structures are in place, the city can continue using these innovations -until environmental changes make them obsolete. In contrast, facets of problems pertaining to the complex regime, could involve aforementioned non-stationary attractor landscapes, volatile dynamics, and intractably many causes and effects. Community engagement practices during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic are a drastic example.</p><p>Some factors distinguishing these two regimes could be formulated as follows:</p><p>Predictability: Issues in the ordered regime are more predictable, as they follow known cycles and change slowly. Those in the complex regime are less predictable, due to interaction-dominant dynamics.</p><p>Interventions vs. continued systems change: In the ordered regime, conventional episodic interventions may be more sufficient to address the problem, as the system is relatively stable. In complex situations, ongoing incremental systems change may be required to navigate the constantly shifting landscape.</p><p>Possibility to be correct vs. need to anticipate: The ordered regime allows for the possibility of being correct with an analytical solution. In the complex regime, the need to anticipate and adapt becomes paramount, as the interconnected issues may unfold in ways that can be described as synergistic, wicked, or intractable. Plans and systems in such environments should be built such that when they eventually fail, they fail in ways that do not cause domino effects -and which can be learned from <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Bar-Yam, 2004b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Mark &amp; Snowden, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Decomposition-based vs. evolutionary solutions: In the ordered regime, decomposition-based solutions may be more effective, as the problem can be reduced to its components, which can be solved in isolation.</p><p>However, the complex regime may require evolutionary approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Bar-Yam, 2006</ref>), as the system adapts and changes in response to interactions among components, the space of possibilities keep evolving, and fatal risks may emerge. What this means is not trying to create solutions, but rather environments that produce solutions -by a dual process of variety creation and selection pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b220">(Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam, 2020a)</ref>.</p><p>Consider promoting healthier lifestyles in a community, for an example of distinguishing the complex from the ordered. The ordered aspects might be fixing the lack of accessible resources for physical activity, such as public parks and exercise facilities. This would happen on the large-scale/low-resolution part of the complexity profile. The more complex aspects could include the use of such facilities, and therein the influences on people's physical activity habits, such as descriptive and injunctive community norms. Here, a more explorative approach would be needed; capitalising on evolutionary principles to create real-world solutions -"evolutionary engineering" <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Bar-Yam, 2006</ref>).</p><p>The goal of such an evolutionary approach here would be to create an environment, where large amounts of community-led initiatives are produced and selected amongst, through a process of collaborative rivalry. In such an environment, individuals of small teams could compete amongst each other for within-team rewards, while collaborating with the team to compete against other teams for community-level rewards. Communities in a municipality could then compete for municipality-level rewards, while collaborating to compete against other municipalities. This, of course, resembles how many modern organisations -with networked individuals, teams, departments, etc. -are already structured. Note that modern organisations are also a result of adaptation pressures, as increased complexity has slowly made traditional hierarchies unfeasible <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bar-Yam, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>The UK Medical Research Council guidance for complex intervention development suggests an approach of continuous serial iteration, where an intervention is refined according to feedback from repeated testing cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b226">(Skivington et al., 2021)</ref>. This may still prove insufficient in highly complex environments. The main difference between evolutionary approaches and current practice is development of diverse parallel solutions in evolutionary engineering: The large variety of these solutions thus provides the system with optionality to pick the most useful ones given a situation, which could not have been anticipated a priori. Capitalising on such an approach may, though, appear inefficient when compared to meticulous planning efforts in the constrained, predictable settings where planning works well. This can lead to difficulties in e.g. convincing funders to pick up the seemingly wasteful approach of parallel evolution. Somehow the notorious failure of the Soviet Union's 5-year planning cycles, does not seem to have dampened our optimism regarding the broad applicability of long-term detailed planning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">A MORE INCLUSIVE VIEW OF BEHAVIOUR CHANGE UNDER UNCERTAINTY?</head><p>As for the challenges tackled by behaviour change research, I would propose a radically increased emphasis on strategic priorities pointed out by complex systems science. By this, I mean the prevention of sudden large-scale health disasters -"silent risk" -to complement the current focus on more visible but rather slowly creeping issues such as non-communicable diseases. What aids in this endeavour is the realisation that while it is often too difficult to understand a situation comprehensively, it may be much easier to understand what should be done. Consider <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 9C</ref>, where the potential of an attractor shift to destruction ought to be mitigated on a priori grounds, not because there is certainty of its eventual materialisation. At the time of writing, SARS-CoV-2 is allowed to reproduce and mutate relatively freely, even though alternatives are available <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Lazarus et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b188">Philippe et al., 2023</ref>) -this is akin to tolerating a decaying tree next to our house, because costs of felling it are large, and it may not eventually collapse in our direction. Part of the reason for this is the politicisation of pandemic response <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Brusselaers et al., 2022)</ref>, and a route to avoiding the same pitfalls would be to aid in creation of operational capacities for swift action, so that structures which allow low-cost response are available when needed. Fire departments, for example, embody the ability to act fast without becoming tools of, nor risking the popularity of, politicians.</p><p>In the absence of dynamically mitigated global connectivity and other precautions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Baker et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Lazarus et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b221">Siegenfeld &amp; Bar-Yam, 2020b)</ref>, pandemics continue to threaten to wipe out all public health gains made in the history of humanity <ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Rauch &amp; Bar-Yam, 2006)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>In conclusion, I suggest we should complement current practices in behaviour change research with ideas from complex systems science. Most of the issues mentioned here stem from emergence in interconnected systems: just as there is no avalanche in a snowflake, there is no social cohesion in an isolated handshake, no behaviour change in an isolated action, and no pandemic in an isolated infection.</p><p>Grappling with non-linear complex systems and multiscale problems often means operating within environments that we can never fully understand or predict in detail. Recognising the complex and ordered regimes in need of different approaches could be a first step to refining our understanding of behaviour change. Accordingly, behaviour change research could benefit from an inclusion of extreme risk mitigation in choosing priorities -in the presence of non-ergodicity, an essential way to increase quality of life is to avoid mass destruction, such as in the case of pandemics, wars, and other "fat tailed" threats <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Cirillo &amp; Taleb, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b193">Rauch &amp; Bar-Yam, 2006)</ref>. Evolutionary designs could aid, particularly in early stage intervention planning under complex regimes. And we should stand constantly prepared to adapt, recognising that unforeseen events present both risks and opportunities in the hitherto unknowable future beyond the "adjacent possible" in the space of possibilities.</p><p>The smallest scales of a large system contain vast complexity. There, an intervention planner's "micro-management" -contra autonomy support -is likely to lead to errors. In Intervention Mapping (Bartholomew Eldredge et al., 2016) terms, being too specific about individuals' performance objectives is highly detrimental by heterogeneity only when the system in question consists of millions of individuals (remember that non-homogeneity was only one of the complexity features introduced here). If evolutionary designs are not used, the system to be intervened upon must be simplified to the point that the intervention designers understand it; we cannot have millions of performance objectives in the complex regime. So the alternatives are to down-scope problems such that they better fit the Intervention Mapping process, allow for more flexibility (e.g. formulating the performance objective as "person chooses the appropriate action"), or move to evolution-aligned processes, where multiscale solutions emerge from the appropriate structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Bar-Yam, 2006</ref>). This is not to dismiss particular intervention types.; a law that regulates everyone's calorie intake is obviously ludicrous, while laws can also shield individuals from environmental complexity (by upholding e.g. a police force). The point is merely to say that large-scale instruments work sub-optimally when adaptability is required (mostly in the complex regime), and adaptable instruments work sub-optimally when large scale is required (mostly in the ordered regime). Hence, our guiding principle should be to empower people to self-manage the small scale, using the satisfaction of basic psychological needs as a heuristic compass, while shielding them from large-scale complexity they are unable to respond to. This strategy not only promotes adaptability and resilience in the face of complexity but also fosters an environment conducive to self-determination and self-organisation. A major caveat, though, lies in giving too much attention to the small scale, as the system is bound to fail if the larger scales are neglected. Luckily, scale-dependent complexity also implies, that things may turn out to be clearer -less complex -on the largest scales.</p><p>But complexity implies that even in larger scales, plans must be able to fail. Martial artists are not taught to never fall, but to fall in such a way that their resilience is not threatened. Whereas intervention research is generally structured such that harm is minimised and learning from failures is maximised, this is often not the case for policy decisions. I hope the current work will also inspire some behaviour change researchers to turn their gaze onto determinants of good governance; how to infuse more science-based complexity thinking in policy makers, the largest scale environmental agents we deal with.

The author took the responsibility for the project's software, including its validation, and conducted the formal analysis. The author, with DP, led the investigation while also curating the gathered data and managing the resources for the project. The author, in cooperation with NH, drafted the manuscript initially and further participated in its review and editing process alongside DP, NH, GM, and KR. The visualisation of the research findings was done by the author and DP. NH provided supervision throughout the project, and project administration was carried out by the author in association with NH. Lastly, NH and the author were responsible for acquiring the funding for the project.

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot">To illustrate this concept, consider the following personal example: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I was an enthusiast of various martial arts disciplines, exploring numerous different approaches rather than mastering a single one in-depth. Over the course of two decades, I transitioned from traditional, more constrained arts to those with fewer assumptions about an opponent's actions. One training session on knife fighting techniques has stuck with me: After losing my weapon and resorting to submission wrestling, my mock-opponent revealed the constrained scope of specialised disciplines compared to the vastness of the space of possibilities: He bit me. I was defeated via momentarily losing my composure due to this surprise. In other words, my environment had an action I had no response to, which caused a subsequent failure to operate successfully.Figure 3Aillustrates, how Ashby's law conceptualises the interplay between challenges and the associated responses.</note>

An LLM -ChatGPT running GPT-4 -was used to assist in some low-complexity tasks of the introduction but not the included papers. Specifically, it was used to flag potentially unclear points in the text and draft initial versions of some paragraphs, based on coarser input from the author. It was also used to create lists of real-world examples of the concepts introduced, from which some ended up being further developed and eventually used, as well as assisting in producing the following article contribution report from the contributor role statements of the articles.</p></div>

In instances where some techniques proved limited in their self-enactability, the author, together with KK, decided on their removal. Contributing to the creation of instructive examples for each technique was another task the author undertook, collaborating with e.g. FE, NH, KK, and MMM. The author was also involved in FE's qualitative interviews to evaluate the acceptability of selected techniques. Moreover, they assisted NH, KK, and</p></div>			</div>
