			<abstract>
				<p>The time taken to make decisions, in combination with the choices made, form the basis of our understanding of speeded human decision-making. A key basis for developing existing theories of speeded decision-making have been the nuanced trends contained within choice response time data, such as the ubiquitous right skew. Here, we provide an empirical exploration of one of these nuanced trends: the patterns of relative mean response time between correct and error responses (i.e., fast/slow errors). Specifically, we investigate both the group-level patterns in fast/slow errors across three brightness discrimination experiments with speed and accuracy emphasis conditions, and the individual-level consistency in these patterns within each experiment. Our findings showed inconsistencies in the patterns of fast/slow errors at the group-level, with each experiment showing a different pattern of relative error speed; only fast errors, only slow errors, and fast errors in one condition and slow errors in the other condition, respectively. Furthermore, all experiments showed inconsistency between participants in whether they display fast or slow errors in at least one condition. Our findings show that even within near-identical experimental paradigms-or the same experimentthere is inconsistency in patterns of and conclusions about fast/slow errors.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Decision-making is a process that takes time, and at least since <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Donders (1868)</ref> researchers have used the time taken to make decisions as a window into the human mind. The time taken to make a decision in combination with the choice that is made are two characteristics that constrain our theories and models of speeded decision making. Speeded decisions may involve something like deciding whether a cloud of dots is moving to the left or right or whether a patch of pixels is mostly dark or mostly bright. Although such decisions seem trivial, they are the foundation of our perceptual experience.</p><p>Further exploration into performance in speeded decision making tasks revealed that there are nuanced trends in the data. Response time (RT) distributions are right skewed despite many researchers treating the data as normal. The relative speed of correct and error responses are not equal <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Laming, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tillman, Van Zandt, &amp; Logan, 2020)</ref>, where error RTs are either faster than correct RTs on average (i.e., fast errors) or slower than correct RTs on average (i.e., slow errors). Slow errors occur when the choice is difficult or accuracy is emphasized and fast errors occur when the choice is easy or there is pressure to decide quickly <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Swensson, 1972)</ref>. Importantly, these nuanced trends often observed in choice response time data have been crucial to our understanding of speeded decision-making. For instance, these trends have formed the qualitative benchmarks used to build and test one of the most dominant theories of how people make speeded decisions: evidence accumulation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Donkin &amp; Brown, 2018</ref>, for a review) via sequential sampling models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Brown &amp; Heathcote, 2008)</ref>. Sequential sampling models assume people continually sample evidence from a stimulus, which accumulates from a starting point at a rate of drift rate towards response thresholds that are associated with specific responses to the stimulus. When the accumulated evidence crosses a response threshold, this triggers the corresponding overt response. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Haaf and Rouder (2017)</ref> proposed that individual consistency of experimental effects should be a theoretical gold standard for establishing ubiquitous effects, which would separate these effects from other effects that show inconsistency across people.</p><p>For instance, this gold standard would require that all participants demonstrate fast errors in an experiment rather than only manifesting fast errors at the group level (i.e., manifesting in the group mean RTs). One benefit of showing that an effect occurs for every participant is that the theories we generate from the data will likely generalise to more people in the population of interest.</p><p>Given that fast and slow errors have been hugely consequential in our understanding of speeded decision-making, our study aims to provide an individual consistency assessment of these nuanced trends. Specifically, our study will assess the variations between people and studies in the patterns of the relative speed of correct and error response time. We will use standard methodology and the methodology of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Haaf and Rouder (2017)</ref> to determine if fast and slow errors consistently occur at the group-level and the individual subject level, respectively. Our paper will provide evidence for the absence or existence of fast and slow error effects via Bayes factors, and where effects exist, we will provide posterior distributions of the effect sizes. We use archival and newly collected experimental data that use speed-accuracy emphasis manipulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Set 1</head><p>For data set 1, we used an experiment from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Rae, Heathcote, Donkin, Averell, and Brown (2014)</ref> that included 49 participants. The data screening process we used was identical to Rae et al., removing 15 participants based on inadequate performance. In the task, participants made brightness discriminations of pixel arrays displayed on a computer screen. Specifically, they were asked to determine whether the arrays were of high or low brightness. Stimuli were 64 × 64 pixel patches. Each pixel was either black or white. Pixels in light patches had a 53% probability of being white, and pixels in a dark patches had a 47% chance of being white. Presentation of stimuli on a computer screen was made dynamic by repeatedly cycling through four squares, where cycling occurred at a rate of 0.015s per square, and continued until a response was made. A randomly selected 20% of trials included a response signal and participants were instructed to respond within 0.3 s of the presentation of the asterisks. On the remaining 80% of trials, participants had up to 5 s to respond. The accuracy emphasis manipulation occurred in alternating blocks of trials, beginning with accuracy emphasis in the first block. At the beginning of accuracy-emphasis blocks "RESPOND ACCURATELY" appeared on the screen until participants pressed the space bar. In speed-emphasis blocks, "RESPOND QUICKLY" appeared in the same manner. In the accuracy-emphasis condition, feedback was given for correct or incorrect responses: "CORRECT" (in green font) or "INCORRECT" (in red font), respectively. In the speed emphasis condition, in addition to the accuracy feedback, feedback was also given on response time. In regular decision trials, if response time was slower than 0.5 s, "TOO SLOW" appeared on the screen. In response deadline trials, if the response time was more than 0.3 s after the appearance of the asterisks, the feedback "BAD TIME" was given, while if the response was within 0.3 s the feedback "GOOD TIME" was given. Rae et al., also used a part-task training method. Participants began by practicing regular trials for approximately 30 min. Response deadline trials were then introduced in a 15 min practice period, where only the three slowest lags were used.</p><p>The main test phase followed, with 20 participants completing one 1-hr session and the remaining 29 participants completing two 1-hr sessions within a 3-day period. There were 14 blocks of 104 trials in each 1-hr session. The methods here are reported more comprehensively in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Rae et al. (2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Set 2</head><p>For data set 2, we used an experiment from Evans, Rae, Bushmakin, Rubin, and Brown (2017) that included 49 participants. The data screening process was identical to Evans et al., removing 2 participants based on inadequate performance. There were only a few differences in method from data set 1, namely (1) the task did not involve response signal trials, (2) participants only completed 4 blocks of 104 trials, and (3) participants also completed the need for closure scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Kruglanski, Atash, De Grada, Mannetti, &amp; Pierro, 2013</ref>), which we do not assess here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Set 3</head><p>Data set 3 was a new experiment that resembles both data set 1 and 2. The complete method of this experiment is presented below.</p><p>Participants. The sample comprised of 100 participants made up of members from the general public and first year psychology students at the Australian College of Applied Psychology (ACAP). The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 64 years (M = 33.02, SD = 10.92). The sample included 67 participants that were female. Participants from the general public were randomly recruited via Facebook advertisement, where they were offered reimbursement for their participation by entering a draw to win one of four $50 gift cards. First-year psychology students at ACAP were recruited by signing up through SONA, where they participated for course credit. All participants consented to their participation and indicated that they met the inclusion criteria of the study; over 18 years of age, proficiency in English, and normal or corrected to normal vision.</p><p>Material. The stimuli were 64 × 64 squares of black and white pixels.</p><p>Brightness of the square was manipulated by varying the probability that a pixel was white. Four checkerboard patterns, each 64 × 64 pixels, were used to mask each stimulus; presented sequentially, they were a checkerboard with 2 × 2 black and white squares, a checkerboard the same as the first but with the black and white squares reversed, a checkerboard with 3 × 3 black and white squares, and its reverse (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ratcliff, 2002)</ref>. Psychopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Peirce, 2007)</ref>, an open-source application for online experiments, was used to display stimuli and recording timing and choice data for the brightness discrimination task. Participants used their personal laptop or computer to complete the questionnaire and other devices did not load the experiment.</p><p>Procedure. Participants accessed the study via a link which lead them to Qualtrics. This link was accessed through SONA for ACAP first year psychology students, or through the Facebook advertisement for all other participants. Once in Qualtrics, participants were provided with all necessary information about the study including its purpose, the procedure, duration, inclusion criteria, risks and confidentiality. Consent of participation indicated that participants consented to participation and that they met the inclusion criteria of the study. Participants first completed the questionnaire which included gathering demographic information (age and gender). After the questionnaire was completed, participants were led to a page which invited them to complete the brightness discrimination task.</p><p>There were two levels of brightness, achieved with two values for the probability of a pixel being white: .45 and .55. These were presented for 150 msec. Each trial began with a plus sign fixation point presented on a grey background for 250 msec. Then the stimulus was displayed, followed by the four checkerboard masks displayed for 17 msec each. Then a grey background was presented until a response was made. In accuracy blocks, if a response was correct, there was a 500-msec pause and then the next trial.</p><p>Feedback was provided in the accuracy conditions. The message "Correct" was displayed in green if they made the correct response, and the message "Try Again" was displayed in red when an incorrect response was made. In the speed emphasis condition, there was no feedback after responses and if a response was longer than 700 ms, the message 'Too Slow' was displayed. There were 3 blocks of the accuracy condition alternated with three blocks of the speed condition. There were 100 trials per block for a total of 600 trials. Data Treatment. In line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ratcliff (1993)</ref>, long and short outlier RTs were removed. That is, RTs on individual trials that were less than 200ms were removed as these responses were considered guesses. RT scores greater than 3 seconds were also removed as these no longer measured perceptual decisions and may have reflected other factors such as lapses in attention</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Group Level Analyses</head><p>In all group level analyses for the three studies in question, we used an almost identical approach. We used a Bayesian repeated measures ANOVA that included the main effects of Emphasis (Speed and Accuracy), Response (Correct and Error), and an interaction between the two factors. Given fast and slow errors are dependent on task difficulty we include the accuracy rates of participants as a covariate in the model. 1 Therefore our focus is on speed and accuracy emphasis while accounting for task difficulty statistically. We analyzed the data with JASP <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(The JASP Team, 2019)</ref>. We quantified the relative evidence for the null hypothesis and a number of alternative hypotheses using the Bayes factor. The null hypothesis posits that all conditions have identical mean RTs. The key alternative hypothesis we wanted to test was an interaction between Emphasis and Response. Where there were interactions we used simple effects analyses to check for a cross over effect where speed emphasis induces fast errors and accuracy emphasis induces slower errors.</p><p>For the ANOVA, we assigned a zero centred Cauchy prior distribution with fixed effects r = 0.5, random effects r = 1, and covariates r = 0.354. Post-hoc comparisons for simple effects were tested using Bayesian t-tests with a zero centred Cauchy prior distribution with r = 1/sqrt(2). In terms of parameter estimation, we were interested in the posterior distribution of the standardized effect size δ for the simple effects of the ANOVA, which is the population version of Cohen's d. We estimated δ for the difference in correct and error mean RT in both the Emphasis conditions. The δ parameter was assigned a zero centred Cauchy prior distribution with r = 1/sqrt(2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subject Level Analyses: Methodology of Haaf and Rouder (2017)</head><p>For the subject-level analyses we used all three data sets. For each study, the speed and accuracy conditions were modelled as separate data sets, which we will refer to as sub-data sets throughout the manuscript. Within each of these sub-data sets there are two conditions: the correct responses and the error responses. The dependent variable we are interested in is the response time (RT). The general subject-level analysis we used here is described in detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Haaf and Rouder (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Haaf and</ref> Rouder <ref type="formula">2019</ref>, but we will provide our study specific details here. In general, each sub-data set is modelled as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Y ijk ∼Normal µ + α i + x j θ i , σ 2 ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where Y ijk is the dependent variable RT, for the kth trial, the ith participant, and the jth condition. The µ + α i term represents the intercepts where µ is the grand mean of intercepts and α i is the deviations across participants. The term x j represents the conditions of the sub-data set, with x j = 0 for the error responses and x j = 1 for the correct responses. The θ i parameter represents the effect size (i.e., difference between mean correct RT and mean error RT) slope for each participant i. The σ 2 parameter is the variance of the dependent variable. We test five different variations of this linear model, where we modify the model structure of the effect parameter θ i .</p><p>The Fast and Slow Error model is denoted M F S and places no order constraints on the individual effects. This means that each participant can have a fast or slow error effect regardless of the condition. Recall that we expect speed emphasis to produce fast errors and accuracy emphasis to produce slow errors. The formal model can be expressed by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">M F S : θ i ∼Normal(ν, η 2 ),</formula><p>where ν and η 2 are population-level parameters describing the mean and variance of effects across the population. M F S allows for both fast and slow errors in either the speed or accuracy conditions. The Fast Error model, denoted M F , captures the constraint that each individual has only fast error effects. The formal model can be expressed by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">M F : θ i ∼Normal + (ν, η 2 ),</formula><p>where Normal + denotes a truncated normal distribution with a lower bound of zero.</p><p>The Slow Error model, denoted M S , captures the constraint that each individual has only slow error effects. The formal model can be expressed by the following equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">M S : θ i ∼Normal − (ν, η 2 ),</formula><p>where Normal − denotes a truncated normal distribution with an upper bound at zero.</p><p>The common-effect model, denoted M 1 , captures the constraint that each individual has the same effect size:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">M 1 : θ i = ν.</formula><p>This common-effect model allows for the effects to be fast errors or slow errors, but assumes a constant effect across all individuals. If individual effects vary only a very small amount then M 1 may be the best model. The final model is the null model, denoted M 0 . The null model posits that each participant's true effect is exactly zero:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">M 0 : θ i = 0.</formula><p>We analyze the above five models in a Bayesian framework similar to <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Haaf and Rouder (2017)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Haaf and Rouder (2019)</ref>. µ and σ 2 , which are common to all models, have the follow non-informative priors:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">f (µ, σ 2 ) ∝ 1 σ 2 .</formula><p>We use the same g-prior structure as Haaf and Rouder (2017) on the population effect parameter ν, each individual's intercept α i , and each individual's effect parameter θ i . Under the g-prior specification, the following priors were placed on the g parameter:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">g α ∼ Inverse-χ 2 (r 2 ),</formula><p>where we set r 2 α = 1.0, r 2 ν = (1/6) 2 , and r 2 θ = (1/10) 2 .</p><p>Posterior distributions for all parameters in the M F S and M 1 models were sampled with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) using the BayesFactor package in R <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Morey, Rouder, &amp; Jamil, 2014)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Set 1</head><p>All ANOVA model comparisons are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>. Note that because the Bayes factors in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> all have the same denominator, the reader can divide any two Bayes factors of any two models to compute the respective Bayes factor. The best model included Emphasis and Response main effects but no interaction between the two, BF 30 = 1.577 × 10 14 . The posterior probability of the interaction model was 40% and the model without was 59%. Given we used a uniform model prior, there is at least some evidence for the interaction. However, inspecting <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> suggests this posterior probability is due to the increase in magnitude in fast errors in the accuracy condition relative to the speed condition, and so nevertheless, the interaction is not the cross-over trend that was expected. The mean RT was faster for error responses than for correct responses regardless of the emphasis condition (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>).  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> . For data set 1, the mean response time for correct and error responses as a function of speed and accuracy emphasis. Error bars represent 95% credible intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Set 2</head><p>All ANOVA model comparisons are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>. The best model included Emphasis, Response, and the interaction between the two, BF 10 = 9.214 × 10 39 . Given the interaction, the differences between correct and error mean RT was explored via a simple effects analysis (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). We found strong evidence for the hypothesis that there is a difference between correct and error mean RT in the speed condition, BF 10 = 22.135. But unexpectedly the mean RT for the error response was slower than the correct response. We found strong evidence for the hypothesis that there is a difference between correct and error RT in the accuracy condition, BF 10 = 3.261 × 10 11 .</p><p>The mean RT was slower for the error response than the correct response. In regards to parameter estimation, in the speed condition, the median of the resulting posterior distribution for δ equals -.470 with a central 95% credible interval that ranges from -.772 to -.174. In the accuracy condition, the median of the resulting posterior distribution for δ equals -1.545 with a central 95% credible interval that ranges from -1.957 to -1.029. Based on the effect sizes, it appears the speed manipulation does not necessarily produce absolute fast errors relative to correct responses, where the error meant RT is faster than the correct mean RT. But the speed emphasis manipulation can produce relatively faster errors compared to the accuracy condition. For instance, although both errors are absolutely slow errors (mean error RT slower than mean correct RT), in the speed condition, the magnitude of the slow error is much smaller compared to the accuracy condition. At the group-level, we unexpectedly did not find evidence for fast error RTs in the archival data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Evans et al. (2017)</ref>. This is in contrast to the Data Set 1 analysis where we did not find evidence for slow errors. Again, the speed-accuracy emphasis manipulation did not produce the expected cross over effect, where speed emphasis produces fast errors and accuracy emphasis produces slow errors relative to correct responses. From our parameter estimation we found that the slow errors were smaller in magnitude in the speed condition compared the accuracy condition, but there was almost no probability density for δ values greater than 0 (i.e., fast errors) in the speed condition.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> . For data set 2, the mean response time for correct and error responses as a function of speed and accuracy emphasis. Error bars represent 95% credible intervals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Set 3</head><p>All ANOVA model comparisons are shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. The best model included Emphasis, Response, and the interaction between the two, BF 10 = 6.625 × 10 75 . The cross over interaction, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>, was explored via simple effects analysis. We found strong evidence for the hypothesis that there is a difference between Correct and Error mean RT in the Speed condition, BF 10 = 9.797 × 10 31 . The mean RT was faster for the error response. We found strong evidence for the hypothesis that there is a difference between Correct and Error RT in the Accuracy condition, BF 10 = 1.039 × 10 5 . The mean RT was slower for the error response.</p><p>In regards to parameter estimation, in the speed condition, the median of the resulting posterior distribution for δ equals 1.905 with a central 95% credible interval that ranges from 1.623 to 2.218. In the accuracy condition, the median of the resulting posterior distribution for δ equals -.559 with a central 95% credible interval that ranges  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subject Level Analyses</head><p>For the subject-level analyses we used the same three data sets as the group-level analyses. We first inspected the posterior means of the θ i parameters, which are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>. The Bayesian estimates in data set 2 and 3 show large amounts of shrinkage suggesting a small amount of variation at the individual level, and therefore, the majority of the observed variation is present at the trial level. Based on these estimates we can conclude most participants show fast errors in Data Set 1 and slow errors in Data Set 2, regardless of the speed/accuracy condition. In Data Set 3, most participants showed fast errors in the speed condition and a small proportion showed fast errors in the accuracy condition.</p><p>To compare the five models, we use Bayes factors. The values for all 6 sub-data sets are provided in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. The asterisk in each column marks the preferred model for each data set. The values in the table are the Bayes factor between the respective model and the preferred model. For example, for Data Set 1, the M F S model is the preferred model. The table shows how much worse the other models perform compared to the preferred one. The preferred model for 4 out of the 6 sub-data sets suggest that participants have a mixture of fast and slow error effects in both the speed and accuracy conditions. Combined with the estimation results, we can infer that the proportion of participants in the same study that shows the unexpected effect (i.e., fast errors in the accuracy condition) is a small proportion of the total sample. In Data Set 2, all participants showed slow errors in the accuracy condition and in Data Set 3 all participants showed fast errors in the speed condition. 1 to 10 133 1 to 10 228 1 to 10 7 1 to 10 67 1 to 10 169 1 to 10 51 M 1 1 to 10 26 1 to 10 71 1 to 10 3 1 to 5140 1 to 10 7 1 to 10 27 M F 1 to 10 2 1 to 10 2 1 to 10 2 1 to 10 3 * 1 to 7368 M S 1 to 10 2 1 to 10 2 1 to 929 * 1 to 10 3 1 to 7521 M F S * * * 1 to 9 1 to 11 * Note.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>We aimed to provide an assessment of the individual consistency of two key benchmark empirical findings of speeded decision making: fast and slow error response times (RT). We re-analysed two archival data sets and one new data set that involved brightness discriminations under both speed and accuracy emphasis. The analyses we conducted determined if the effects exist at the group level and are consistent at the individual subject level. Overall, we found inconsistent patterns across experiments looking at group-level trends and inconsistent patterns across people looking at subject level trends.</p><p>Group-level inconsistencies have previously been found in fast and slow patterns of errors, but not in the context of a study aimed at investigating these inconsistencies.</p><p>For instance, fast errors are not commonly observed in recognition memory experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Osth, Bora, Dennis, &amp; Heathcote, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2004)</ref>. Previous work has shown in a signal detection task one participant with only fast errors and one participant with only slow errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ratcliff, Van Zandt, &amp; McKoon, 1999)</ref>. Our study extends on this previous work by highlighting the inconsistencies in both fast and slow errors at group and subject levels. Despite the inconsistencies we found in our study, we still observed errors that were not the same speed as correct responses. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows that M 0 was never the preferred model and this model represented the scenario where fast and slow errors do not exist. We therefore suggest these effects are not always present in data or consistent across individuals in the same data set.</p><p>The methods of <ref type="bibr">Rouder (2017, 2019)</ref> were designed to test whether everyone shows a particular pattern of data. However, it is important to note that many researchers in the field of speeded decision making would not claim that every subject should show fast and slow errors in every experiment, and as noted in the previous paragraph, the lack of consistency in these effects has showed up in previous work in the field of speeded decision making. Nonetheless, there has not been a the difference in results across experiments may be a systematic effect due to methodological differences. For example, the data sets we analyzed manipulate difficulty by using the same two levels for every subject. However, compared to data set 3, data sets 1 and 2 use slightly more difficult stimuli (e.g., 53% of being white), a dynamic presentation, an interlaced response signal procedure, and presented stimuli until a response was made. However, it is not clear these methodological differences explain much of the current findings. For instance, despite the identical procedures of data sets 1 and 2, the participants showed clear individual differences and between study differences in fast and slow error patterns. Nonetheless, to truly explore these systematic differences in difficulty, a small-N psychophysical study with individually tailored difficulty levels would be a more appropriate test.</p><p>There is also other reasons to believe that difficulty would not explain our findings. We considered the possibility that participants that do not conform to the predicted patterns are participants who find the task difficult. However, in data set 1 in the accuracy condition, all but 2 participants did not conform to the predicted patterns, and the accuracy rates in this condition ranged from 53% to 93%, which means some of these non-conforming participants found the task relatively easy. Similarly, a large majority of participants in data set 2 did not conform to the predicted patterns and the accuracy rates in this condition range from 62% to 94% as well. Moreover, in the current study we included the accuracy rates of participants as a covariate in the model to control for this variable statistically.</p><p>Although we have mentioned extending on this work with a small-N psycho-physical study, it is important to highlight that all of the tasks here involve brightness discrimination. This task is quite common in the field of speeded decision making but it would still be of interest to see if the current results translate to a wide range of paradigms. Perhaps a larger study could consider a meta-analysis with every speed-accuracy experiment that is accessible included.</p><p>Overall, our study shows that fast and slow errors can be inconsistent across similar experiments and individuals. Given these nuanced trends often observed in choice response time data have been crucial to our understanding of speeded decision-making, the inconsistency in these effect observed here are important to consider on a case-by-case basis in studies involving difficulty and speed-accuracy </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>For data set 3, the mean response time for correct and error responses as a function of speed and accuracy emphasis.

Here we provided an empirical exploration of fast and slow errors and test if all participants show these effects in the interest of revealing the extent of individual differences. But what may explain the inconsistency of these effects? The differences across experiments and individuals may just be random noise and the statistical evidence is misleading. For example, van Doorn, Aust, Haaf, Stefan, and Wagenmakers (2021) have recently shown that obtaining Bayes factors in a mixed model design such as the current one is non-trivial and results can vary depending on model setup.
