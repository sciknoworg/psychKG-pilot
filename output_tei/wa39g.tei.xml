			<abstract>
				<p>Current transport systems are not sufficiently sustainable. In the quest to reduce emissions caused by the transport sector, individual mode choice plays a major role. Influencing individuals&apos; decision-making without external force has been a growing research concern in the recent years. While the application in other areas is abundant and often successful, the research suggests that the utilization of social norms in the context of mode choice is limited. In this study, we aim to 1) find out if intentions to behave more sustainably (mode choice) can be effectively influenced by dynamic social norms messaging, and 2) whether this relationship holds whilst including the common barriers to behavior change in the context of individual mobility in the model. To test this, we designed an online experiment (N = 187), where we randomly assigned the participants to one of three groups, and presented them either with a dynamic social norm messaging, a static descriptive norm messaging, or no messaging (control condition). Comparing the means of the two experimental conditions to the control group, the results show that the participants who viewed the dynamic norm messaging reported an increased intention to travel sustainably while the opposite was the case for the static norm condition. However, none of the mean differences reached statistical significance. Bearing that in mind, our results indicate that dynamic norm messaging might be preferable to descriptive norm messaging. We discuss and identify several reasons for these findings, outline future directions, and consider practical implications. However, more studies are needed to discern whether dynamic norm messaging poses a viable mean to influence people&apos;s intentions-and behaviors-to choose sustainable modes of transport.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Individual mobility and social norms</head><p>We have recently made great strides in making the transportation system more sustainablethe introduction and spread of electrified vehicles, Mobility as a Service (MaaS), and various other engineering solutions such as traffic light management come to mind -it still remains the case that in many cities and rural regions across the world, the private car -one of the least energy-efficient means of transportation -dominates the modal split. In Germany, the share (measured in billions of kilometers) of motorized individual transport (private cars and motorcycles) remained more or less constant between 1991 (76,7 %) and 2019 (73,6 %). <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Umweltbundesamt, 2022)</ref> Such high usage is not without costs. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the transportation and traffic sector accounted for 23 % of total energy-related CO2 emissions in 2014. Without action to reduce emissions, this figure could double by 2050. What are the associated impacts? For instance, transportation affects air quality by releasing particulate matter and other pollutants such as lead, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. In larger and more densely populated cities, smog -which is associated with respiratory problems, allergies, and eye inflammation -can result from the accumulation of these pollutants. Transportation also impacts water and soil quality, which in turn contributes to the systematic destruction of natural habitats and threatens plant and animal biodiversity. <ref type="bibr">(IPCC, 2014)</ref> Personal cars also take up a considerable amount of space, both when parked and moving.</p><p>According to the calculations from Randelhoff (2019), cars take up about 13.5 m 2 when parked, and ca. 65.2 m 2 when they move at 30 km/h. Compare this to a bike (1.2 m 2 , 41 m 2 ) or a bus (2.5 m 2 , 15.9 m 2 ), and the following picture emerges: THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 7 Additionally, cars stand unused over 95 % of the time, blocking the limited urban space <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Schmitt, 2016)</ref>. Changing people's mobility habits in cities to free up this space would create new and meaningful uses and design opportunities for these areas. In short, we need a behavior change.</p><p>In that regard, what folk intuition leads us to believe, the empirical research largely confirms:</p><p>We like to keep up with the Joneses. Social norms -"unwritten codes and informal understandings that define what we expect of other people and what they expect of us" (Young, 2015) -influence people's decisions and behaviors. A few examples where normative interventions have been leveraged to incite behavior change include:</p><p>• energy conservation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Goldstein et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Schultz et al., 2007)</ref> • water conservation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Goldstein et al., 2008)</ref> • avoiding littering <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Cialdini et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kallgren et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Reno et al., 1993)</ref> In short, communicating that social referents perform a certain behavior leads to others adopting the same behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cialdini &amp; Goldstein, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 8</head><p>However, in the field of individual mobility, the social norm in most immediate environmentsthe cities or villages we live in -reinforces the status quo. Frequent use of a private car is ubiquitous, salient, well-accepted, and enjoyed by many <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ramos et al., 2020)</ref>: People habitually drive their cars anywhere they please -to work, to run errands, to pick up and deposit their grandmas in the hospital for their weekly check-up.</p><p>It is no wonder that cars are so excessively used. They are convenient, socially well-accepted, and extremely habit-forming. People form emotional bonds with their private car, enjoy riding them, and see them as status symbols <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gossling, 2017)</ref>. Driving then no longer fulfills only pragmatic (instrumental) functions, but precisely also symbolic and affective functions that are important for the user <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Steg, 2005)</ref>. So, in addition to habits, attitudes toward driving and the car itself play a major role in the choice of transportation for everyday trips <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Hoffmann et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Steg (2005)</ref> identified frequent drivers, respondents with a positive attitude toward cars, males, and younger respondents as those who rated these motives, which go beyond the practical function of cars, as particularly important. The broader system in which they are embedded -with massive car industry lobbies, laws, and regulations -creates an autopoiesis effect: The features of the system are replicated, maintained, and successfully transferred to later generations <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Geels, 2004)</ref>. We see the world through a car-colored lens 1 .</p><p>Thus, reminding the individual of what others are doing might only remind them that most people find little wrong in their car use. After all, it is what most of us do.</p><p>All is not lost, however. According to the system of representative traffic surveys (original:</p><p>System repräsentativer Verkehrsbefragungen [SrV]), in 2018 more than 60 % of people in large German cities regularly use eco-modes (incl. public transport, cycling, walking; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gerike et al., 2020b)</ref>. In Berlin, even 74% of people used these modes at the time of the survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gerike et al., 2020a)</ref>.</p><p>In other words, while the overarching and salient social norm remains car-centric, we observe a shift in attitudes, and (albeit small) a trend toward using sustainable means of transportation. Can this changing social norm -the dynamic norm -be used to spark behavior change? Research from other fields suggests it might.</p><p>For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Sparkman &amp; Walton (2017)</ref> found, in a series of experiments, that communicating a shifting attitude toward meat consumption 2 increased people's intentions (Exp. 1) to eat less meat. In a further experiment (Exp. 4), they even found evidence for behavior change: The cafeteria-goers, upon exposure to dynamic norm messaging, ordered a lunch without meat more frequently than the control (who saw a norm unrelated to food), and descriptive norm condition (who saw the same information without making the change salient).</p><p>Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mortensen et al. (2019)</ref> have also been able to find the effects of the dynamic norm on sustainable behavior. They showed that dynamic norm messages led people to consume less water (Exp. 1) or increased their willingness to give their time to a good cause (Exp. 2).</p><p>In the following sections, we lay the groundwork for social norms research, and hypothesize about the sustainable potential of dynamic norm intervention in the field of individual mobility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>10</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Theoretical and empirical background</head><p>In the following chapter, we will fundamentally define social norms and examine relevant theories and mechanisms behind them. On this basis, we will present the construct of dynamic norms and their mechanisms in different research fields. We then take a closer look at the use of social norms to influence people's mobility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Social norms -definitions, theories, mechanisms</head><p>We begin this section with definitions of, distinctions in, and the mechanisms through which social norms take effect.</p><p>Social norms can be thought of as shared rules of conduct that either foster or hinder decisions and behaviors by approval or disapproval <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Elster, 1989)</ref>. They are separate from moral and personal norms because they are not followed unconditionally -people conform only in certain conditions (e.g., when the behavior of interest is observable, salient, and when a perceived majority does it). Similarly, social norms are distinct from habits, conventions, and legal rules, because they pertain to the public rather than private action, are rarely in the interest of the individual, and are not a product of deliberate planning. Social norms are thus implicit, conditionally followed, and motivated by external enforcement <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Farrow et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>A further point that bears mentioning pertains to the variety of social norms. Based on the literature we have surveyed, we might make the following distinction between injunctive and descriptive norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cialdini et al., 1990)</ref>. The injunctive norms signal the likelihood of obtaining social approval or disapproval and the subsequent emotional payoff of an action. They reflect the perceived social norm in any given environment -something one intuits holistically in a given context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 11</head><p>The descriptive norm, on the other hand, reflects the objective 3 reality of what others do (or do not do) in a given environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cialdini et al., 1990</ref>).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Farrow et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Morris et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>But what are the mechanisms that make people conform to the social norm?</p><p>There are three theories that we consider in the present paper: the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991), the Theory of Social Normative Behavior (TSNB; <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Lapinski &amp; Rimal, 2005)</ref>, and the Focus Theory of Normative Conduct <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cialdini et al., 1991)</ref> 4 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>12</head><p>In <ref type="bibr">TPB (Ajzen, 1991)</ref>, behavior is thought to be influenced distally by a person's attitude, perceived behavioral control, subjective norm, and proximally by the behavioral intention. Zooming into the normative influence (subjective norm), <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">White &amp; Argo (2009)</ref> found strong evidence that social identity -the individual differences in group-specific norms and the degree to which one identifies with the relevant group -is one of the main mechanisms through which the individual conforms to the social norm.</p><p>The TSNB <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lapinski &amp; Rimal, 2005)</ref>, in contrast, postulates that the link between descriptive norms and behavior is modulated by:</p><p>• individual's outcome expectations ("what will I get?"),</p><p>• injunctive norms ("what do others (dis)approve of?"),</p><p>• identification with the referent group,</p><p>• and ego involvement or how much one associates their identity with the group.</p><p>Lastly, according to the Focus Theory of Normative Conduct <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cialdini et al., 1991)</ref>, norms influence behavior only when made salient during decision-making. The motivation to conform to the norm can be threefold. First, the person might wish to conform to avoid discrepancy by achieving a fit between their behavior and the perceived norm. Second, affiliation might guide persons' behaviormeeting the need to belong to a social group one identifies with in the given situation. Third, norm conformity might occur because it leads to a positive self-image. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Cialdini and Goldstein (2004)</ref> note that in general "people have a strong need to enhance their self-concepts by behaving consistently with their actions, statements, commitments, beliefs, and self-ascribed traits" <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cialdini &amp; Goldstein, 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 13</head><p>Considering the above mentioned theories together, conformity to a social norm likely occurs:</p><p>• via the processes of social identity, or how much one identifies with the referent group,</p><p>• outcome expectations, or the likely emotional or material payoff,</p><p>• the perceptions of what others approve or disapprove of -the injunctive norm,</p><p>• the person's need to behave accurately,</p><p>• and lastly through self-image management.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Dynamic norms and their mechanisms</head><p>In recent years, the development of social norms has progressed via the work of Sparkman and</p><p>Walton <ref type="formula">2017</ref>and <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mortensen et al. (2019)</ref>. These researchers have further subdivided the descriptive norm into its static and dynamic components. To illustrate, many interventions communicate the social norm via messaging. For instance:</p><p>Recent research has shown that 30 % of Americans make an effort to limit their meat consumption. That means that 3 in 10 people eat less meat than they otherwise would. reflects the static norm.</p><p>In contrast, the statement that reads:</p><p>Recent research has shown that, in the last 5 years, 30 % of Americans have now started to make an effort to limit their meat consumption. That means that, in recent years, 3 in 10 people have changed their behavior and begun to eat less meat than they otherwise would.</p><p>reflects the dynamic norm. Thus, rather than focusing on the current social norm, the dynamic norm focuses on the change or the future trend, signified in the above by the phrases: "in the last 5 years", and "have changed".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 14</head><p>Why should the focus on the dynamic aspects of social norms be more effective in supporting behavioral change? The researchers have theorized a few possible reasons. First, people tend to assume that a change in one direction continues in that direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Hubbard, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Markman &amp; Guenther, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Second, the increasing probability of possible future outcomes is perceived as more imminent <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Maglio &amp; Polman, 2016)</ref>. In other words, if a behavior (say choosing to bike to work) is portrayed as increasing in popularity, this might lead others to preconform to the future descriptive norm. It also signals the perceived importance of the behavior to other people (the current injunctive norm; <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Sparkman &amp; Walton, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>It might also be that the information about the future norm helps to overcome certain behavioral barriers. In a series of experiments, Sparkman and Walton <ref type="formula">2019</ref> They provide correlational evidence of the effectiveness of dynamic norm intervention on each of the above barriers and conclude that "correlational analyses <ref type="bibr">[…]</ref> show that it is the most salient barriers to change in a context that are remedied most by dynamic norms. Further, in each context dynamic norms increased intentions or interest to change as compared to no norm control conditions"</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(Sparkman &amp; Walton, 2019).</formula><p>But how is all this relevant in the field of individual mobility? We address this in the following section. Zooming into the area of individual mobility, researchers have also been able to find the effects of social norms on people's mobility behaviors (or intentions).</p><p>Rollin &amp; Bamberg <ref type="formula">2020</ref>, in a series of experiments, investigated the effects of descriptive social norms on (self-reported) transportation behaviors and people's intentions to travel sustainably. Using the city typology by <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Klinger et al. (2013)</ref> and mediational models, they found that the relationship between the type of the city (for instance car-centric or bike-centric) and self-reported transportation behavior (i.e. using one's car or a bike) is mediated by the respective descriptive social norm. In other words, the social norm in a given city partially explains the corresponding transportation behaviors.</p><p>In the second study, Bamberg and Rollin (2020) randomly assigned participants into two groups.</p><p>Group 1 saw Photo A (see figure 2), which depicted one of the lanes as a bike lane with cyclists. Group 2 saw Photo B, which showed a two-lane car street. The participants were then asked to report how frequently, on a 6-point scale (almost never, …, and almost daily), people living in their city district use different means of transportation. The three resulting outcome variables were:</p><p>1) car-use-related descriptive social norm (i.e., how often others use their car)</p><p>2) eco-mobility-related descriptive social norm and (i.e., how often others use sustainable means of transportation)</p><p>3) self-reported own car use • the car-use-related descriptive social norm was higher, i.e. people were more willing to use their cars in such an environment.</p><p>• the eco-mobility related descriptive social norm was lower, i.e. people were less likely to use sustainable means of transportation in such an environment.</p><p>• the own (self-reported) car use was higher.</p><p>Taken together, Bamberg and Rollin (2020) provide (albeit correlational) evidence for the role of descriptive social norms in people's individual mobility.</p><p>Another piece of evidence comes from a month-long field experiment among students and faculty staff by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kormos et al. (2015)</ref>. In it, the researchers asked the participants in the first week to "reduce private vehicle use by 25 %" (baseline condition common to all groups). Then, the participants were randomly assigned into three groups -control, low-, or high social norm conditions. In the high social norm condition, the participants received a piece of information that overreported others' efforts to reduce private vehicle use ("previous study participants have reduced their private vehicle use by 19 %"). In the low social norm condition, the opposite was the case ("previous study participants have reduced their private vehicle use by 5 %"). Reaching a critical mass of people that perform a certain behavior. When the majority of people set the standard, it is easy for the rest to follow that behavior. In the examples above, the researchers were dealing with more or less idealized states that often aren't given in ecological settings of everyday  <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Mortensen et al., 2019)</ref>. Thus, norm messages can also make undesirable behavior salient and thereby normalize it. This kind of unexpected effect of descriptive norms was shown by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cialdini et al. (2006)</ref> in an experiment with social norms regarding theft of petrified wood in a national park: Visitors confronted with the descriptive norm information were more likely to also commit theft, whereas the injunctive norm information did not.</p><p>In the field of individual mobility, this poses a problem: the critical mass of people -and thus the prevailing descriptive norm -uses cars rather than sustainable means of transportation. Pointing out such a norm might lead people who use their cars frequently to feel justified in their use, and even bring those who are traveling sustainably to consider the car as an alternative. After all, it is what most everyone does.</p><p>However, with the growing awareness of the environmental impacts of transportation, many people have already begun to change their behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Ipsos, 2019)</ref>. This is also reflected in the statistics Against this backdrop, we developed a pilot study, research questions, and hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Pilot Study, Research Question, and Hypotheses</head><p>The aim of the present study is to extend the scope of dynamic norm research to the realm of individual mobility. Will the dynamic norm messaging affect peoples' intentions to travel sustainably, so that they shift from car use to other modes of transportation?</p><p>To answer this question, we conducted a pilot study (N = 32, 59 % female, M = 26.41 years, SD = 7.22 years) 6 . The pilot study had two aims. First, to establish a proof of concept of whether dynamic norms messaging might influence people's intentions. Second, to identify the barriers that prevent people from changing their mobility behavior.</p><p>In the first part of the pilot study, we presented the participants either with descriptive or dynamic norm messaging.</p><p>The items read:</p><p>1. descriptive: "What do you think is the percentage of people in cities currently trying to reduce their car use and use some form of environmental transport to work/education (e.g., public transport, walking, bicycling, carpooling, etc.)?"</p><p>5 Within this article, we understand the intention to travel sustainably as modal shift and operationalized it in the following item, measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = very unlikely, 4 = undecided, 7 = very likely, -1 For a discussion on that, please see <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Sheeran &amp; Webb (2016)</ref>. But this is not the focus here.</p><p>6 The entire pilot study with all items and text modules used can be viewed in appendix A. walking, bicycling, carpooling, etc.) in the last 5 years?"</p><p>We then asked participants to guess the percentage of people who try to reduce their car use and increase their use of sustainable means of transportation. We researched possible barriers that hinder behavior change in individual mobility and came up with six different psychological factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Javaid et al., 2020)</ref>:</p><p>• attitudes (how people feel about different modes of transportation)</p><p>• perceived behavioral control (whether people feel they can change anything about their mobility behavior)</p><p>• habits (past behavior of using different modes of transportation)</p><p>• social influence of the local environment (neighbors and other people living in the same area)</p><p>• social influence of people in one's own social environment (people one feels close to)</p><p>• perception of infrastructure (to what extent it is possible to use certain means of transportation due to local conditions)</p><p>Inspired by the studies of Sparkman and Walton (2019) the participants were asked to identify three (out of the six) psychological barriers that they feel:</p><p>1. are the most important (1 -6, 1 being the most important) and</p><p>2. occur the most frequently as a reason for not making, or being able to make, a behavior change in one's individual mobility (1 -5, 1 being not often at all).</p><p>The following three psychological barriers were perceived as the most important and frequent, sorted from highest to lowest 7 :</p><p>1. habits regarding transportation use 2. infrastructure / local conditions</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">attitudes toward transportation modes</head><p>This gave us insight into which barriers people identify as the most salient in their environments.</p><p>We used this knowledge in constructing the subsequent experiment, where we aimed to:</p><p>1. answer the primary question: Are people's intentions to use sustainable means of transportation (e.g. public transport, bike, walking) affected by dynamic norm messaging?</p><p>2. test whether the barriers which we identified can be overcome by dynamic norm messaging (a mediation).</p><p>We expect the dynamic norm message to be most effective on intention, followed by the descriptive norm information, which in turn is more effective than no norm (control group). To test this, we randomly assigned participants to three conditions in the following experiment -descriptive norm, dynamic norm, and control condition (no norm messaging) and measured their intentions to travel sustainably (mode choice). Below are the resulting hypotheses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses</head><p>1. The presentation of an article that includes dynamic norm messaging will lead to significantly higher intention ratings, as compared to the control condition.</p><p>2.

Upon removing the outliers (n = 8; people who responded unusually quickly), there were 187 subjects participating in the study, of which 60 % were women. The subjects were between 18 and 73 years old (M = 31.09 years, SD = 12.36 years).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 24</head><p>Participants were initially recruited using the snowball principle, using social contacts and colleagues. In order to achieve a larger sample size, we additionally recruited participants via the central experimental server of the Faculty of Psychology at the Technical University Dresden. Therefore, a large part of the sample consists of university staff, faculty members, and students.</p><p>Participants received an invitation link to the online study and were immediately and randomly assigned to one of the three experimental groups. For this we implemented the experiment in SoSci-Survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Leiner, 2019)</ref>, an online platform that allows the creation and distribution of online questionnaires. After a short written introduction, the participants of the two norm messaging groups were asked to read a short newspaper-like article about changing mobility behavior in society. The control group received no such stimulus and was sent directly to the survey. First, the intentions to use different sustainable modes of transport were asked, followed by the three psychological barriers (habits, attitudes, perception of the transport system) and the collection of demographic data. The full questionnaire can be viewed in appendix B.</p><p>We recruited participants who have access to the following means of transportation:</p><p>• a private car (own, in the household, or through a shared system),</p><p>• a bicycle, e-bike, or a pedelec,</p><p>• a subscription ticket for public transport (PT).</p><p>The sample consisted mainly of low-to middle-income individuals (36 % with € 501-1000; 22 % with € 1001-2000, 19 % with € 2001-3000). The majority reported having a university entrance qualification (42 % high school diploma) or a university degree (45 %) as their educational level. Most participants reported living in large cities (76 %) and owning a car (89 %). Half of the participants had no preference for a car brand (53 %) and no brand was preferred overall. For a more detailed characterization of the sample, the sociodemographic data (and also the baseline characteristics of the experimental groups) can be found in appendix C. In the following, we outline the dependent and measured variables.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.1.">Dependent variables</head><p>We asked participants about their intentions to change their mobility behavior with the following question: "To what extent are you considering changing your mobility behavior in the near future (within a year) to try to use your car less?" Participants then read "In the near future, I am considering …" and were shown a series of items to which they could respond on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = very unlikely, 4 = undecided, 7 = very likely, -1 = not relevant for me):</p><p>• … to make more use of environmental transport 8 in general.</p><p>• … to use or buy an e-car.</p><p>• … to use public transport more or to buy a public transport subscription.</p><p>• … to use the bicycle more or to buy a bicycle.</p><p>• … to use or buy an e-bike/pedelec.</p><p>• … to walk more often.</p><p>• … to use more individual booking systems.</p><p>• … to use more collective alternatives.</p><p>8 The term "environmental transport" encompasses all more environmentally friendly modes of transport, i.e. nonmotorized transport (walking, bicycles), electrically powered transport (e-bikes, e-scooters), public transport (ÖPNV) and also car sharing. This explanation was also given to the participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 26</head><p>In the pre-analysis report, we questioned whether we can aggregate the various intention ratings into one index variable. It was concievable that a person who, for instance, has a high intention to use e-car in the future would also rate other sustainable (as compared to a regular car) means of transportation highly. Clearly, this proved not to be the case, as the means between the various intentions varied highly.</p><p>As a result, we proceeded with using the intention "to make more use of environmental transport in general" as the sole dependent variable in the further analyses (henceforth as "environmental transport intention", ETI).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Measured variables</head><p>We also measured the perceived barriers to behavior change identified in the pilot study.</p><p>Habits pertaining to car driving were measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 7 = very much; ɑ = 0.91) with the Self Report Habit Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gardner et al., 2012)</ref>. We used the following items in validated german translation <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Thurn, 2014)</ref>: Beneficial attitudes toward private cars were also identified as a barrier in the pilot study. To measure attitudes, we used the scale from <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Kroesen et al. (2017)</ref>. We began with the following statement: "To what extent do you feel that driving…". We then displayed the following items, again measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 7 = very much) which we aggregated into an index (ɑ = 0.85).</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">•</formula><p>• is simple.</p><p>• is relaxing.</p><p>• is fun.</p><p>• healthy.</p><p>• safe.</p><p>• is environmentally friendly.</p><p>The last barrier identified in the pilot study pertained to features of the transportation system containing aspects of satisfaction, safety, efficiency, convenience, and effectiveness. We displayed the following self-constructed items, again measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 7 = very much) which we aggregated into an index (ɑ = 0. Finally, we gathered socio-demographic data -gender, age, income, educational background, and employment. In addition, we also collected mobility-specific variables such as region, general access to means of transport, possibilities to use a car, and favorite car brand. On the last pages of the online survey, participants had the opportunity to leave comments and consent to the use of their data. The full questionnaire can be viewed in the appendix B.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Design and Procedure</head><p>The study employed a between-subjects design, where the participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or one of the two experimental groups: We created two versions of the article, one for each social norm condition (descriptive and dynamic). These versions were identical besides the wording of the social norms messaging. In the descriptive norm condition, terms such as "current" and "present" were used, whereas in the dynamic norm condition, the phrase "in the last five years" was repeated. In addition, the particular mode of transportation and the reported percentage were bolded in the body text to draw attention to them. To illustrate this, examples of the operationalization of social norms are outlined here.</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">•</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 30</head><p>We then asked them to rate their behavioral intentions to use various sustainable means of transportation. Subsequently, the three barriers we identified in the pilot study (habits, attitudes, and the perception of the quality of the system) were assessed, followed by the demographics. Lastly, we thanked the participants for their participation, revealed the intent of the study, and dismissed them.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Results</head><p>To begin with, the overall descriptive statistics give an overview of the intentions related to the different means of transport. Below are the transport mode items, followed by the means and standard deviations: The scale ranges from: 1 = very unlikely, 4 = undecided, 7 = very likely.</p><p>The primary question we aimed to answer was whether the information presented in the form of changing dynamic norm is more influential on people's ETI, as compared to 1) control condition and</p><p>2) descriptive norm condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 31</head><p>Looking at the data descriptively, we found the following means and standard deviations of ETI in each group: The scale ranges from: 1 = very unlikely, 4 = undecided, 7 = very likely.</p><p>To test hypotheses 1 to 3, we calculated a one-way ANOVA, setting the condition (factor with 3 levels) as the predictor variable, and the intention to use sustainable means of transportation as the main dependent variable. We predicted that the presentation of the article featuring dynamic norm messaging will lead to higher intentions than the control group (Hypothesis 1) and the descriptive norm condition (Hypothesis 3). We also predicted that the descriptive norm condition will lead to higher intention ratings than the control group (Hypothesis 2).</p><p>The ANOVA suggests that the main effect of Condition is statistically not significant and small (F(2, 163) = 1.05, p = 0.351; Eta2 = 0.01, 95 % CI [0.00, 1.00]) 9 . Thus, we rejected hypotheses 1 to 3.</p><p>The second question we aimed to answer was whether the assumed effect of the Condition on people's intentions would hold whilst including the indices of Habits, Attitudes, and the System as mediators in the statistical model (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>To reiterate, we did not find the main effect of the Condition on ETI. However, some authors suggest that this is not a necessary prerequisite to calculating a mediation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kim, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Instead, a necessary requirement is that the predictor variable (Condition) influences the three mediators (Habits, Attitudes, and System) significantly. This, however, proved also not to be the case, as the following ANOVAs suggest:</p><p>• The main effect of Condition on the index of Habits is statistically not significant and very small (F(2, 163) = 0.03, p = 0.970; Eta2 = 3.74e-04, 95 % CI [0.00, 1.00]).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The main effect of Condition on the index of Attitudes is statistically not significant and very small (F(2, 163) = 0.35, p = 0.704; Eta2 = 4.29e-03, 95 % CI [0.00, 1.00]).</p><p>• The main effect of Condition on the index of System is statistically not significant and small (F(2, 163) = 1.32, p = 0.270; Eta2 = 0.02, 95 % CI [0.00, 1.00]).</p><p>Based on these grounds, we did not deem it feasible to test Hypothesis 4 and compute a mediation model.</p><p>In summary, although the means of the intentions to use ETI differed between the groups, none of them did so significantly. Furthermore, we did not compute the mediation model based on missing prerequisites. We discuss the results below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion</head><p>We designed a pilot study and an experiment to test the effectiveness of dynamic norm messaging as a tool to influence people's individual mobility intentions. In the former, we presented participants with two social norm statements -dynamic and descriptive -and asked them to rate the percentage of others who are already changing their behavior. In the latter, participants saw a short online newspaper article, in which we manipulated the wording to reflect either dynamic or descriptive norm messaging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 33</head><p>In both the pilot study and the experiment, we found that the dynamic norms consistently outperformed descriptive norms as means to increase people's intentions to travel sustainably. This difference, however, did not reach significance, which led us to reject our hypotheses. There are several possible explanations as to why the postulated effect did not emerge.</p><p>First, the overall intention of the entire sample to travel sustainably was high. On a seven-point scale, where seven indicates the highest intention to travel sustainably, the participants in our sample reported a mean of 5.30 (SD = 2.14). This might suggest ceiling effects, thus restricting a meaningful analysis of the results. Similarly, the mean of the control group (which did not receive any treatment) was likewise high (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">table 2</ref>). Viewed through the lens of TPB, this suggests that the personal norm of sustainable individual mobility might already be high, which leaves very little space for people's intentions to be swayed by a rising social norm. This idea is further underscored by some of the comments the participants left at the end of the survey (translated from German):</p><p>"Since I hardly ever drive, the options for reducing driving are very slim…."</p><p>"Since I practically never drive, it is difficult to reduce this use further."</p><p>"The question about changing behavior in the next year doesn't work if you've already almost completely given up your car."</p><p>Therefore, it can be said that the sample may not have been appropriate and cannot be considered as the ideal target group for the manipulation. It would be good to test this type of norm messages primarily on people who drive regularly and define themselves as drivers.</p><p>Second, the form of the manipulation we employed (an online newspaper article) might not have been suitable to produce the intended effect. The various studies that employ dynamic norms as means to affect the dependent variable work with singular statements, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cheng et al. (2020)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Sparkman &amp; Walton (2017)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Mortensen et al. (2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 34</head><p>By opting for a more ecologically valid design of a newspaper article, which the participants can encounter in their daily lives, we might have diluted the strength of the experimental manipulation.</p><p>Similarly, it is possible that the inherent stimulus sampling variability 10 produced a stimulus that was, in this particular instance, not suitable to find the desired effect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Yarkoni, 2020)</ref>. Furthermore, upon inspecting the final norm statements, we also noticed that the wording we employed might have conflated the dynamic and descriptive norm conditions together, leading to a weak manipulation between groups. In general, the concept and, in particular, the operationalization of social norms is relatively undefined, making it not entirely clear how to utilize it. Since there are no valid guidelines for the operationalization of social norms so far, the design is on the one hand very free, but on the other hand it is also difficult to produce a sharply defined manipulation. It also remains unclear how credible (and thus effective) social norms actually are, especially when they are constructed on the basis of percentage numbers. Therefore, the development of manipulation should be better prepared and repeatedly tested in several pilot studies.</p><p>Third, the effect of dynamic norms on dependent variables of interest (behavioral intentions, behavior, attitudes, etc.) might not be as robust as assumed. Predictably, and as research has repeatedly shown, interventions that focus only on the intention to change behavior are not very effective and stable <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Mertens et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Maier et al., 2022)</ref>. Indeed, the initial publication of the 2017 paper by Similarly, the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Lee and Liu (2021)</ref>, which investigated the effects of dynamic norms on people's intentions to get a flu shot and to eat less red meat, "did not find a comparative advantage of dynamic norm messages compared to static norm messages" <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Lee &amp; Liu, 2021)</ref>. Lastly, in a randomized cross-over trial in retail store restaurants that spanned two weeks, <ref type="bibr">Çoker et al. (2022)</ref> also found no effects of the dynamic norms intervention on the percentage sales of meat-vs plant-based dishes.</p><p>Fourth, it might be that the field of individual mobility is a difficult nut to crack. Indeed, this was discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Sparkman &amp; Walton (2019)</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">"[…]</formula><p>dynamic norms are unlikely to reduce driving for commuters who lack other options, at least in the short term. Here the key barrier is structural. We do not expect dynamic norms to enable change or challenge salient barriers when people are not afforded real opportunities to change."</p><p>Next to structural barriers, the psychological barriers to changing individual mobility are strong habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ramos et al., 2020)</ref>, favorable attitudes toward private cars, and prominent descriptive and injunctive norms <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Javaid et al., 2020)</ref>. Overall, it is possible that one of the reasons we found no effect is simply due to the complexity of the problem, where simple solutions will likely not work at scale.</p><p>Indeed, the multitude of reasons for using a private car was also reflected in the comments. For one participant, it was health:</p><p>"To do without a car is only possible if you have enough time and the physical health to get it done."</p><p>For another, it was the security it provides for their family:</p><p>"The most important reason from my point of view for a car in the city, namely to pick up children from daycare centers after work, is missing. This is certainly a major obstacle for families."</p><p>Lastly, for some it is simply not a viable option to travel sustainably:</p><p>"I would very much like to do without the car, but my work can be reached by car in 50 minutes, by bike and public transport in 2-2.25 hours. Unfortunately, public transport is not an alternative."</p><p>Taken together, this suggests that the messaging aimed to encourage people to travel sustainably must cater to their individual needs. Blanket solutions, such as communicating a shifting norm, will likely work on some but not all.</p><p>What might have improved the current study? We can think of several things. First, we employed a broad, unspecified reference group <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Mertens &amp; Schultz, 2021)</ref>. It might be more effective to mention a specific target group (e.g., the citizens of a certain city) in the social norm messaging. That way, the one who reads the message is more likely to assume it is relevant specifically to them. In the current format, it was easy to dismiss the presented statistics as irrelevant. Second, we did not measure people's baseline mobility patterns, i.e. with what means -and how often -they travel with various means of transportation (a problem lamented by several participants in the comments section). It is likely that those who already travel primarily via public transportation, a bike, or by walking, are less intent on changing their already sustainable behaviors even further (if they even can).</p><p>We believe there are also a few strengths -and future implications -of our study. First, although only descriptive, we have found that there is a directional effect of dynamic norms on people's intentions to travel sustainably.</p><p>This finding could serve as a springboard for future studies that, hopefully, address the issues present in this one. Second, when comparing the mean values of the descriptive norm group and the control group, we found that communicating the descriptive norm actually decreases people's intentions to travel sustainably, leading to a backfire effect.</p><p>This was not the case for the dynamic norm condition. This underscores the fact that in ecological settings 11 , where the majority norm is in most environments car-centric, the descriptive norm might actually lead to lesser intentions (and behaviors) to travel sustainably (see also: <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Hauslbauer et al., 2022)</ref>. Thus, when communicating a social norm in the field of sustainable transportation, the authorities could benefit from showing the current trend in modal split rather than the absolute Another possible future direction might be to employ a longitudinal design and measure the long-term effects of dynamic norms messaging. Indeed, such a longitudinal design was recently successfully employed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Loschelder et al. (2019)</ref> to measure the impact of dynamic norm messaging on the avoidance of to-go disposable coffee cups.</p><p>Using an experience sampling framework, a study might employ varied forms of (social norms) messaging, delivered regularly (daily or weekly), and measure participant's individual mobility (at minimum, type of transportation and volume). This has the benefit of measuring: a) the actual behavior (either self-reported or measured via an app) and b) the influence of dynamic norms messaging over time.</p><p>In summary, despite not finding the predicted effect of dynamic norm messaging on the intentions to travel more sustainably, we believe -based on interpreting the means between the groups -that there is potential in investigating dynamic norm messaging in the context of individual mobility. To do so, the researchers need to a) find a specific group who is both able and willing to change their individual mobility; and b) craft and deliver an accurate, believable, and salient dynamic norm message at an opportune time, and c) pilot their manipulations extensively <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Sparkman et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>

It might be rewarding to clarify the question of what concrete interventions are required and whether and to what extent norm messages can actually be successful in the mobility context.</figDesc></figure>

Moving beyond correlational evidence,<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kormos et al.

However, even though there is evidence that social normsthe descriptive norm especially -can help to nudge people toward more sustainable means of transportation, there is a problem.</figDesc><table><row><cell>mobility.</cell></row><row><cell>Besides experiments, the meta-analytical evidence also suggests that individual mobility can be</cell></row><row><cell>influenced by social norms.

In Bamberg andRollin's study (2020), the researchers used non-standard circumstances (pop-up bike lanes in response to a global pandemic) that artificially inflated the descriptive norm in people's social environments.Kormos et al.'s (2015)  intervention targeted the university context and used other tools such as goal-setting, incentivization, and reminders that inflated the descriptive social norm of how people commute.THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 18In other words, the usefulness and effectiveness of descriptive social norm interventions are dependent upon what the (perceived) majority does. Indeed, if the majority performs undesirable behavior (such as driving their cars), making such a norm salient might lead to a backfire effect</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

This growing proportion of people can be used in the context of individual mobility to appeal to people who have not yet considered changing their individual mobility.THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 19Based on the above reasoning, we note that there is a research gap: to our knowledge, no studies have tested the influence of dynamic norms messaging on people's intention to travel more sustainably 5 . But, according to our literature review, dynamic norms might be a viable strategy for behavior change in the context of individual mobility.</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>

The paired t-test testing the difference between descriptive and dynamic norm conditions (mean of the differences = -1.18) suggests that the difference is statistically not significant, and very small (difference = -1.18, 95 % CI [-6.18, 3.83], t(33) = -0.48, p = 0.636; Cohen's d = -0.08, 95 % CI [-0.42, 0.26]). Regardless of this difference in estimation, we wanted to use the same percentages for descriptive and dynamic norm groups in the experiment to ensure that we do not test an effect of numbers. The effect of the respective norm message in the two intervention groups should be due to the different wording and not due to the used numbers. To avoid measuring an effect of the numbers used in the norm messages, we used the same numbers in the manipulation for both intervention groups. So there is no distinction in percentages between the descriptive and dynamic norm information. In the second part of the pilot study, we extracted people's beliefs regarding what barriers prevent them from changing their mobility behavior.THE INFLUENCE OF DYNAMIC NORMS ON INTENTIONS TO TRAVEL MORE SUSTAINABLY 21</note></figure>

It might be the case that, for instance, a person does not have access to all the behavioral traces in the given environment, and thus makes a judgment based on the observable behaviors. The descriptive norm in this example would thus not reflect the objective reality, but only the objective reality available to the person.4 In this paper, we give an overview of the social norm literature from the social psychology standpoint, and refer the reader interested in a more holistic approach that includes theories originating from the field of economics to<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Farrow et al.
