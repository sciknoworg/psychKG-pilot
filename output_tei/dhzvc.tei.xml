			<abstract>
				<p>We can use prior knowledge of temporal structure to make predictions about how an event will unfold, and this schematic knowledge has been shown to impact the way that event memories are encoded and later reconstructed. Existing paradigms for studying prediction, however, are largely unable to separate effects of prediction accuracy from effects of stimulus probability: likely outcomes are assumed to be predicted, while unlikely outcomes are assumed to cause prediction errors. Here we use a novel approach in which we can independently manipulate prediction success and stimulus probability, by using real-time eye-tracking when viewing moves in a board game. The moves can be consistent or inconsistent with a participant&apos;s predictions (assessed via fixation patterns) and can be also be likely or unlikely to be played by a strategic player. By decorrelating these two measures, we found that both probability and prediction accuracy boost memory through two separate mechanisms, leading to different eye-movement strategies at retrieval. Accurate prediction improved encoding precision, allowing participants to directly retrieve these moves without the use of schematic knowledge. Probable moves, on the other hand, led to improved memory through a retrieval-time strategy in which schematic knowledge was used to generate candidate moves for recognition. These results challenge the prevailing idea that only prediction errors can enhance event memories, and provide a more realistic paradigm for studying schemas, learning, and decision making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Our perception and memories of the world are scaffolded by our prior experiences.</p><p>We can use schemas, the structured knowledge built from these prior experiences, to make predictions about upcoming events <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Clark, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Friston, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Huang et al., 2023)</ref>. For example, we can predict what characters in a story might do next or whether an athlete is about to score in a game. These predictions have important implications for how we remember events, but the ways in which accurate or inaccurate predictions impact subsequent memory are still controversial. While numerous research studies have shown that prediction errors lead to better episodic memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Antony et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Bein et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Quent et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rouhani et al., 2018)</ref>, in part through enhanced encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Frank &amp; Kafkas, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Neuschatz et al., 2002)</ref>, our previous work found that prediction accuracy was associated with better memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Huang et al., 2023)</ref>, and learning new information is generally easier when it is congruent with prior knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bein et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Brod &amp; Shing, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Buuren et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Quent et al., 2022)</ref>. In most memory paradigms, however, it is difficult to determine whether making an accurate prediction has a causal effect on memory at all, since the accuracy of predictions (made before the stimulus appears) is almost exactly confounded with the schema-consistency of the stimulus (the probability of the stimulus occurring in the current context). Probable stimuli are more likely to be predicted, and improbable stimuli tend to elicit prediction errors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Quent et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Schliephake et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Because these two concepts are so closely related, prior work has largely conflated cognitive processes related to prediction with those related to probability, but in fact these may engage quite different mechanisms occurring at different points in time.</p><p>Before a stimulus is presented, we can generate predictions about this stimulus based on what we have recently observed. These predictions will often be sparse and incomplete; for realistic events, there is generally an enormous space of possible outcomes and only limited time and cognitive resources available to make predictions. After experiencing the stimulus, we can assess the accuracy of our prediction, and (whether we were right or wrong) we can try to make sense of the outcome by using our schematic knowledge to link it to our prior observations. It is possible that, especially during an engaging narrative or game <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Baldassano, 2023)</ref>, events can occur that we did not predict but are nonetheless schema-consistent; we can observe in retrospect that this event did in fact have a meaningful probability of occurring and we can integrate it into our current event model. This dissociation between pre-stimulus predictions and the schema-consistency of the observed stimulus in fact plays a key role in some cognitive theories of humor, which propose that jokes present incongruities that are intended to be unpredictable while still allowing for a meaningful after-the-fact resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Attardo, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>In most lab-based paradigms, however, there are a very small number of possible outcomes, and participants can predict all the outcomes that "make sense" (have high probability). When memory differences are observed between predicted and unpredicted stimuli, it is therefore unclear whether these differences are driven by the match between the stimulus and the pre-stimulus predictions per se (prediction accuracy) or by post-presentation evaluations of the match between the stimulus and the schema (stimulus probability). The current study aimed at investigating the specific impact of accurate prediction on memory, separate from the probability of the stimulus, and the potential mechanisms behind prediction-and probabilityrelated effects. These mechanisms could involve processes during encoding (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bransford &amp; Johnson, 1972)</ref> that improve memory precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bellana et al., 2021)</ref>, or reconstruction processes that improve retrieval of specific kinds of information (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Anderson &amp; Pichert, 1978)</ref>. Schematic knowledge can serve as a probabilistic prior, biasing responses to be more schema-consistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alba &amp; Hasher, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bartlett, 1932;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bransford &amp; Johnson, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Cheng et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Graesser &amp; Nakamura, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Hemmer &amp; Steyvers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Huttenlocher et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Ramey et al., 2022)</ref>, or providing retrieval cues that can allow access to weak episodic memories <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Qureshi et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Watkins &amp; Gardiner, 1979)</ref>. Recent work in visual scene perception has shown that patterns of visual attention for a repeated image are driven differentially by episodic memory versus schematic knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Ramey et al., 2020)</ref>, suggesting that eye movements in response to a memory cue could index the degree to which a schema-based retrieval strategy is being used. If prediction accuracy and stimulus probability influence memory differently, different strategies might be used when people encode and recall moves that are probable compared to moves that are predicted.</p><p>In this study, we used a paradigm recently developed in our lab <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Huang et al., 2023)</ref>, in conjunction with real-time eye-tracking, to manipulate prediction accuracy separately from stimulus probability and to determine when a schema-based strategy was used during retrieval. We used a game called 4-in-a-row, an extension of tic-tac-toe, where two players compete to connect four pieces in a row (in either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction) on a 4x9 board <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(van Opheusden et al., 2023)</ref>. In our previous study, we found that participants spontaneously engaged in predictive eye movements when trying to encoding game sequences shown to them, and that making schema-consistent predictions was associated with improved subsequent memory. However, move predictions were much more likely to be accurate when the move was probable (according to a model of likely moves during effective gameplay); we therefore could not determine whether generating an accurate prediction had a specific consequence for memory, separate from the probability of the observed move. In the current study, we adjusted the presented moves in real time, controlling both the probability of the move and the specific predictions a participant was making for this move (assessed via eye-tracking). We therefore independently manipulated prediction accuracy and stimulus probability by showing moves that people were predicting vs. not predicting, as well as moves that were probable vs. improbable. We hypothesized that both prediction accuracy and stimulus probability separately contribute to better memory, as reflected in higher accuracy, higher confidence, and faster reaction times.</p><p>We additionally developed a method for using eye-movements to detect the use of schematic knowledge at retrieval, allowing us to study the mechanisms by which stimulus probability and prediction accuracy influence recall. We hypothesized that probable moves would be encoded through a lower-precision gist-like representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bellana et al., 2021)</ref>, requiring more reliance on schematic knowledge at retrieval. Current theories, however, provide conflicting hypotheses about the effect of prediction accuracy on recall strategy. Stimuli that do not generate a prediction error might be less salient, leading to a less robust episodic memory trace requiring more schema-based reconstruction at retrieval. Alternatively, generating an accurate representation of a stimulus before it appears could enhance the depth and quality of encoding due to additional encoding time <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Naim et al., 2020)</ref> or by eliciting a positive emotional response <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lee &amp; Sternthal, 1999)</ref>.</p><p>We conducted two studies in which participants learned the rules of the 4-in-a-row game and then attempted to remember moves generated in real time. Moves separately varied in their probability (their likelihood to occur during a 4-in-a-row game) and the degree to which they were predicted by the participant (based on their eye movements). Across both studies, we found that prediction accuracy and move probability independently contributed to better memory, but through different mechanisms: accurately-predicted moves were more precisely encoded and could be recalled without relying on the game schema, while probable moves were remembered through a schema-based recall process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Before coming in for the eye-tracking session, participants (N = 38, study 1; N = 94, study 2) were told the rules of the game: two players take turns playing pieces on a 4x9 grid, and a player wins when they have four pieces in a row <ref type="bibr">(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)</ref>. After becoming familiar with strategies in the game by playing against an AI opponent, participants came to the lab to perform a memory task while their eye movements were tracked ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). They were shown a board from the middle of a 4-in-a-row game, and then another piece appeared on the board. After eight encoding trials and a 15 sec distractor task, participants were then shown the boards again and asked to recall the move that was played on each board. They completed ten blocks of the memory task in the whole experiment. Online four-in-a-row gameplay task. Prior to coming to the lab, participants played 80 (study 1) or 40 games (study 2) against AI opponents. The participant and the AI took turns placing pieces on a 4x9 grid, with the goal of connecting four pieces in a row (in any direction) to win the game. b. In-lab memory encoding and retrieval task. In each block, participants first went through 8 encoding trials. Each trial indicated which player would make the next move for 1 second, an initial game board was shown for 10 (study 1) or 8 (study 2) seconds, and then the next move was added to the board and shown for 5 seconds. After a 15-second distractor task, in which participants judged whether a single digit number was odd or even, participants were shown the initial boards again (in a random order), and recalled the move shown for that board and rated their confidence in their response. Participants' eye movements were tracked throughout both encoding and retrieval.</p><p>Unknown to the participants, the moves being shown on each board were generated in real time based on two factors <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2a</ref>). First, a gameplay model was used to generate a probability distribution of next moves that would be played at this board position by a strong AI. Second, the locations of the participant's fixations on unoccupied squares were used as a measure of their predictions about where the move would appear on this trial. The two distributions or their inverses were multiplied and normalized to generate distributions corresponding to four conditions: probable and predicted, probable but unpredicted, improbable but predicted, and improbable and unpredicted. In study 1, each block contained two moves drawn from each of the four distributions. One potential downside of this design is that this results in many improbable moves, which may discourage participants from using their general knowledge about the game. In study 2, we instead sampled moves only from the two probable conditions, with half of the moves predicted and half unpredicted. Participants were also explicitly told in study 2 to make a prediction with their eyes while looking at the boards before the moves appeared. After a move is generated, the move probability for the particular move is extracted from the probability distribution, and prediction accuracy is evaluated based on duration of pre-move fixations on the square where the move appeared ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref>). which the presented move was drawn: improbable and unpredicted (used in study 1 only), improbable but predicted (study 1 only), probable but unpredicted (both studies), and probable and predicted (both studies). A move was sampled from one of the distributions. b: Distribution of move probability and prediction accuracy in each of the four or two conditions in study 1 and 2.</p><p>After a move was sampled, it was evaluated with the move probability distribution and the prediction distribution. This generates a move probability and prediction accuracy for each move (in this example, move probability is -6.6 and prediction accuracy is 0.55). Each point in the scatterplot is a move, and the color of the points correspond to the distribution from which the move was drawn.</p><p>In our previous study, we found that experienced participants spent more time fixating on empty squares where a move was likely to appear in typical play (based on our game model); since the actual moves shown were drawn from this same distribution, this led to a substantial correlation between prediction accuracy and move probability (r = .228) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Huang et al., 2023)</ref>. Here we replicated the finding that participants' fixations on empty squares of the initial board were significantly correlated with the probability of the move (study 1: t = 72.86, p &lt; 0.001; study 2: t = 148.86, p &lt; 0.001), but our real-time procedure for selecting moves allowed us to separately control the extent to which moves were likely and were predicted. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure   2b</ref> shows the distribution of move probability and prediction accuracy for all the moves in the study, demonstrating that our conditions successfully sampled from different portions of this space and decorrelated prediction accuracy from move probability in both study 1 (r = .074) and study 2 (r = -.065), allowing us to more rigorously estimate the independent impact of move probability and prediction accuracy on memory. Because moves are sampled probabilistically, they vary within and across our four conditions in terms of both their probability to occur and the degree to which the participant predicted them on this trial. For the rest of the paper, we focus on move probability and prediction accuracy for each move as continuousvalued predictors rather than treating each condition as a discrete category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Move probability and prediction accuracy both improve subsequent memory</head><p>We first conducted a mixed-effects logistic regression to predict memory accuracy from move probability, prediction accuracy, and their interactions with random subject-specific slopes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3, top)</ref>. In both studies, memory was better for moves that were probable (study 1: beta = 0.233, z = 4.64, p &lt; .001; study 2: beta = 0.379, z = 10.07, p &lt; .001) and for moves that were correctly predicted (study 1: beta = 0.289, z = 5.19, p &lt; .001; study 2: beta = 0.334, z = 11.47, p &lt; .001). The interactions were not significant in either study (both p &gt; .3).</p><p>We next looked at the effect of both measures and their interactions on memory confidence and reaction time ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, middle and bottom). Due to convergence issues, these analyses were performed with linear mixed-effects models with random intercepts only. In both studies, participants were more confident about their answers when the move probability was higher (study 1: beta = 0.09, t = 2.08, p = .03; study 2: beta = 0.258, t = 7.90, p &lt; .001) and if the prediction accuracy was higher (study 1: beta = 0.159, t = 2.90, p = .004; study 2: beta = 0.111, t = 4.04, p &lt; .001). Both move probability and prediction accuracy led to faster reaction times in study 2 (move probability: beta = -0.268, t = -3.60, p &lt; .001; prediction accuracy: beta = -0.170 t = -2.71, p = .007). Similar results were found in study 1 but the effects were not statistically significant (move probability: beta = -0.200, t = -1.350, p = .18; prediction accuracy: beta = -0.362, t = -1.93, p = .054). None of the interactions between move probability and prediction accuracy were significant (all p &gt; .31). These findings provide strong evidence that both move probability and prediction accuracy separately and causally contribute to stronger memories that are recalled faster and with more confidence.</p><p>Since prediction errors could benefit memory through enhanced encoding when remembering something schema-inconsistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Quent et al., 2022)</ref>, the relationship between prediction accuracy and memory accuracy could be non-linear. To test this hypothesis in our data, we conducted a mixed effect logistic regression predicting memory accuracy from move probability and prediction accuracy with linear and quadratic terms for both effects, and a random subject intercept. While the linear effects for both measures remained robust in both studies (all p &lt; .001), quadratic effects were largely absent. The square of prediction accuracy showed no effect on memory (p = .38 in study and p = .92 in study 2). Move probability squared did show a significant effect in study 2 (z = 1.99, p = .047) and trended towards significance in study 1 (z = 1.71, p = .087), but this effect was weak compared to the linear effect; critically, memory still improved monotonically with move probability (with an attenuated slope for low-probability moves).  <ref type="bibr">2 (b)</ref>. In both studies, memory was significantly more accurate and confident for more likely moves and when predictions were accurate. These two factors also improved reaction times, though this effect was significant only in study 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eye movements reveal multiple distinct retrieval strategies</head><p>We next sought to understand the strategies that participants are using at retrieval by modeling their eye movements. Since moves in a four-in-a-row game are partially predictable (some moves are more likely to be played than others), it's possible that participants could use this schematic knowledge at retrieval, either by generating plausible moves for the given board then attempting to recognize which move was previously seen <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Watkins &amp; Gardiner, 1979)</ref> or by simply biasing their guesses toward probable moves. Alternatively, participants could form a precise episodic memory for a move and then directly retrieve this memory when the board is shown, without having to make use of schematic knowledge. We hypothesized that these two strategies would lead to different patterns of eye movements, and ran a linear regression to predict retrieval fixations as a combination of the move probability map and the correct next move <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4a</ref>). The coefficient of the correct move regressor ( ) represents the extent to which a participant looked specifically at the correct move, indicating retrieval of an episodic memory. On the other hand, the coefficient of the move probability regressor ( ) represents how often a participant was fixating on likely but incorrect squares during retrieval for this move, indicating schema use. Across all the retrieval trials in both studies, the two coefficients were negatively correlated (r = -.542, p &lt; .001), showing a tradeoff between remembering a move precisely and relying on a schema. As an additional validation, we confirmed that larger was associated with worse memory: more schematic eye movements predicted lower memory accuracy (study 1: beta = -20.0, z = -7.14, p &lt; .001; study 2: beta = -34.93, z = -18.09, p &lt; .001), higher reaction times both when considering all moves (study 1: beta = 14.05, t = 2.76, p = .006; study 2: beta = 10.8, t = 5.86, p &lt; .001) or when restricting to correct moves only (study 1: beta = 22.5, t = 4.87, p &lt; .001; study 2: beta = 17.5, t = 6.09, p &lt;.001),</p><p>and lower confidence for all moves (study 1: beta = -11.8, t = -5.11, p &lt; .001; study 2: beta = -11.3, t = -9.91, p &lt; .001) or for correct moves only (study 1: beta = -5.04, t = -2.62, p = .009; study 2: beta = -3.21, t = -2.62, p = .009).</p><p>We further explored how schematic eye movements at retrieval ( ) were related to participants' responses. One possibility is that schematic eye movements at retrieval simply indicate that participants are preparing to make a schemaconsistent guess on that trial. If that is the case, we should see that participants select the most probable moves at recall when is high. Alternatively, schematic eye movements at retrieval could indicate that participants were using their schema to generate potential moves in hopes of being able to recognize the correct move from episodic memory, in which case participants will be able to report the correct move even if it was not the most probable move for this board position.</p><p>We tested this prediction by measuring the relationship between schematic eye movements at retrieval and the probability of the recalled move, separately for correct and incorrect trials. When a move was incorrectly recalled, schematic eye movements strongly predicted the probability of the recalled move (study 1: t = 22.79, p &lt; .001, study 2: t = 21.16, p &lt; .001), suggesting that on these trials schematic eye movements were used to guess a likely move in the absence of episodic memory. When a move was correctly recalled, however, schematic eye movements were not related to the probability of the recalled move (study 1: t = 1.40, p = 0.162, study 2: t = -0.17, p = .865). This provides evidence that schemas can be used strategically to retrieve episodic memories, rather than simply biasing guessing toward probable outcomes. when boards were presented at retrieval, using two regressors: the likelihood of each move according to our gameplay model, and the location of the correct move that was shown during encoding. The coefficient of the move probability regressor measures the extent to which schema-based eye movements were present at retrieval. b: In both studies, when we evoked a prediction error during encoding, we observed more schema-driven eye movements at retrieval. In study 1, moves that were more probable also showed more schematic eye movements; in study 2, this relationship only held for moves that were accurately predicted. c: In both studies, higher prediction accuracy is related to more time spent looking directly at the correct move, suggesting precise memory. More probable moves were remembered more precisely if they were also accurately predicted.</p><p>Prediction accuracy, but not probability, reduces schema use at retrieval</p><p>These analyses provide evidence that schema-consistent eye movements at retrieval provide a measure of participants' recall strategy. We next examined whether this strategy differed for probable versus improbable moves and for predicted versus unpredicted moves. We conducted a linear mixed-effects regression with the schematic eye movement at retrieval ( ) as the outcome variable and prediction accuracy (from eye movement before the move shows up), the probability of the move (according to the gameplay model), and their interaction as predictors, with a random subject intercept. In study 1, both move probability and prediction accuracy significantly impacted schematic eye movement, but in the opposite directions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4b</ref>). Higher move probability was associated with more schematic eye movement (t = 3.30, p = .001), whereas prediction accuracy was associated with less schematic eye movement (t = -9.75, p &lt; .001). The interaction between move probability and prediction accuracy was not significant (t = 0.657, p = .511). In study 2, move probability had no main effect on schematic eye movement (t = -0.02, p = .811), while prediction accuracy was associated with less schematic eye movement (t = -15.40, p &lt; .001). There was a significant interaction between the two measures (t = 2.99, p = .003), such that more probable moves led to more schematic eye movement only if the prediction was accurate.</p><p>We also looked at the coefficient for the correct move regressor ( ), which we interpreted as the extent to which people precisely remembered the move <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Figure 4c</ref>). We found that move probability has no impact on this coefficient in either study (p &gt; .108), but high prediction accuracy led to significantly more fixations on the correct move (t = 20.8, p &lt;.001, study 1; t = 25.28, p &lt; .001, study 2). There was also an interaction found in both studies, such that the least precise memory occurred when the move was probable but not predicted (t = 2.58, p = .010, study 1; t = 5.55, p &lt; .001, study 2).</p><p>These analyses therefore found that accurate predictions were consistently associated at retrieval with less schematic eye movement and more precise memory. This suggests that making an accurate prediction results in the formation of a stronger episodic memory that can later be recalled directly. For these wellpredicted moves, both studies found that more probable moves were more likely to be reconstructed via schema-based inference, suggesting that participants likely encoded them in a gist-like manner. This potentially saves attentional resources and allows them to focus on episodically encoding improbable moves (which cannot be easily accessed via a schema-based strategy at retrieval). For moves with large prediction errors, the effect of move probability was inconsistent across studies, with increasing for higher probability moves only in study 1.</p><p>One explanation why accurately predicted moves were more precisely remembered is that participants were already looking at the move location and did not have to visually search for it, giving them a longer time to encode the move. To test for this possibility, we conducted a control analysis in which we measured the amount of time that participants spent fixating on the move after it appeared. Although prediction accuracy was associated with longer looking times at the correct move during encoding, (study 1: t = 14.22, p &lt; .001; study 2: t = 21.39, p &lt; .001), spending a longer time looking at the correct move during the encoding period did not lead to better memory in either study (p &gt; .427).</p><p>Since we found that prediction accuracy decreased and that lower predicted more accurate responses, we tested whether reduced schematic eye movements mediated the memory benefits of accurate prediction.

One core benefit of having a schema for an event is that it enables us to make predictions, which can have important implications for memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Antony et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rouhani et al., 2018)</ref>. This study aimed to measure the specific impact of successful and unsuccessful predictions on subsequent memory by deconfounding prediction accuracy from stimulus probability. We accomplished this using a novel paradigm in which we measured predictions using real-time eye-tracking and generated stimuli that were consistent or inconsistent with these predictions. We found that confirming a participant's prediction improved later memory, whether or not the predicted stimulus was actually schema-consistent.</p><p>Prediction accuracy also impacted the way that moves were recalled; using eye movements at retrieval to detect when participants were using a schema-based reconstruction strategy, we found that this strategy was used more often for moves that were poorly predicted during encoding. Overall, these results support a model in which prediction accuracy and stimulus probability contribute to better memory through different mechanisms; accurate prediction facilitates the formation of a precise episodic memory that is recalled directly, while probable stimuli were more likely to be reconstructed through a schema-based process at retrieval.</p><p>Decades of research studies have examined how schemas help memory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson, 1981)</ref>. For schema-consistent information, like a pan on a stove, schemas not only facilitate rapid consolidation during encoding <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Sommer et al., 2022)</ref>, but also allow people to come up with guesses at retrieval that could serve as cues for recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Anderson &amp; Pichert, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Watkins &amp; Gardiner, 1979)</ref>. Recent work has argued for a central role of prediction in memory, showing that merely making a schema-consistent prediction is associated with better memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Huang et al., 2023)</ref>, and that how schema-inconsistent information is remembered depends on the strength of expectation and prediction error <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Quent et al., 2021)</ref>. Our results</p><p>show that schema knowledge can in fact improve memory through two separable mechanisms: by enhancing precise memory encoding through more accurate predictions, and by steering retrieval processes toward likely outcomes.</p><p>We found no evidence for improved memory from large prediction errors as reported in previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Antony et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Bein et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Greve et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rouhani et al., 2018)</ref>. It is important to note, however, that many studies showing benefits of prediction error use reward paradigms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Jang et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rouhani et al., 2018)</ref>, in which prediction errors provide a critical learning signal for improving mental models or action policies. Prediction error in the current study does not provide any new information about rewards or the rules of the game, and therefore may not trigger processes that enhanced memory in these studies. Additionally, outside the context of reinforcement learning, the effects of prediction error on memory have been less clear. In schema research, participants are often shown object in a congruent or incongruent context <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Quent et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Van Kesteren et al., 2013)</ref>, where incongruent pairs are thought to generate prediction errors. Although some studies have shown better memory for schema-incongruent pairs (e.g., Quent et al., 2022), many have found the opposite result (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Höltje &amp; Mecklinger, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ortiz-Tudela et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Van Kesteren et al., 2013)</ref>. In addition, it is worth noting that both reinforcement learning and schema research tend to use recognition or forced-choice memory tests (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Greve et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Greve et al., , 2019</ref>, and research has shown better memory for unexpected items during recognition, but not recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Lew &amp; Howe, 2017)</ref>. This paper therefore supports the view that the impact of prediction error on memory is more nuanced than previously assumed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Bein et al., 2023)</ref>, and further research is needed to find the contexts in which prediction error benefits memory. One important context to consider is the levels of cortical hierarchy in which the prediction errors occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Tarder-Stoll et al., 2023)</ref>. The current study relies on predictions that likely rely on higher-order regions, and the effect of prediction error on memory might be different from when the prediction is lower-level (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Strange &amp; Dolan, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>A common challenge in studying the impact schematic knowledge is that it is difficult to disentangle encoding-time and retrieval-time mechanisms, motivating manipulations such as changing the schema between encoding and retrieval (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Anderson et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bransford &amp; Johnson, 1972)</ref>. Our study established a novel method of disentangling these two kinds of processes, and showed distinct mechanisms through which predicted and probable information were remembered.</p><p>We interpret the findings as evidence that that prediction confirmation leads to an enhanced episodic encoding process <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Ramey et al., 2022)</ref>, perhaps through facilitated processing of the expected stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Sommer et al., 2022)</ref>. In addition, the positive emotional response evoked by correct predictions might make the stimulus more salient <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Lee &amp; Sternthal, 1999)</ref>. Another potential mechanism could be related to how predicted and probable information were consolidated <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Van Kesteren et al., 2013)</ref>. Future research could further investigate how memory encoding process and the resulting memory representation differs for predicted and unpredicted items, to better understand how accurate predictions facilitate precise episodic memory.</p><p>The finding that accurate prediction promotes forming a robust episodic memory is particularly relevant to theories of how people remember schema-consistent and schema-inconsistent information. For example, the "Schema-Linked Interactions between Medial prefrontal and Medial temporal lobe" model <ref type="bibr">(SLIMM, van Kesteren et al., 2012)</ref> proposes that schema-consistent information will be remembered through reactivation of the schema whereas schema-inconsistent information will be remembered through retrieval of a specific instance memory. Our results are partially consistent with this model, in this sense that moves with high probability (consistent with the game schema) relied more on a generate-and-recognize strategy during recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Watkins &amp; Gardiner, 1979)</ref>, though this effect was found only for accurately predicted moves in study 2. This suggests that participants might create strong episodic memories only for improbable moves that they know will be difficult to generate at retrieval. This strategy may be especially useful when the task is more difficult, explaining why it is used more in study 1 (which requires memorization of many more low-probability moves). Our findings are also consistent with prior work showing efficient encoding of schema-consistent information, but at the cost of memory precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Bellana et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>However, we also showed that accurate predictions (which are more likely to occur for schema-consistent moves) created strong episodic memories that could be retrieved without engaging schematic processes. Our findings could potentially explain why <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Quent et al. (2022)</ref> found that both schema-consistent and inconsistent items were associated with better recollection, if participants were able to make accurate predictions for the schema-consistent items. Future studies should consider the impact of prediction confirmation when designing experiments, since parameters such as the interval between context and item might facilitate or inhibit predictions and impact schema effects on memory.</p><p>Finally, this work developed two methodological advances that can provide new insights in memory research and related fields. Although gaze-contingent paradigms have been used to study vision (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rayner, 1975)</ref> and social cognition (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Wang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Wilms et al., 2010)</ref>, and eye-tracking methods have been used in memory research <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Clewett et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Ramey et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Wynn et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Wynn et al., , 2020</ref>, adaptive paradigms with real-time eye-tracking have not previously been applied to memory research. Our work demonstrates that it is possible to track predictions over a large space of potential actions (on a 4x9 game board) to control when prediction errors occur, isolating the impact of prediction errors from factors such as outcome likelihood or reward magnitude. We also showed that eye movements during retrieval can index not only episodic knowledge about the item <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Wynn et al., 2019)</ref>, but also the degree to which schematic knowledge is being used to search for a memory. Both of these methods can be applied to fields including learning and decision making. For example, real-time eye-tracking could be used to dissociate reward and prediction error in learning research <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Rouhani et al., 2018)</ref>, and eye movements during decision making could potentially reveal what strategies (e.g., episodic memory, model-free learning, model-based learning) were used, in addition to modeling the behavioral choice people made <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Nicholas et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>To conclude, the current study used a complex board game in combination with realtime eye-tracking to test how prediction accuracy and stimulus probability separately contribute to memory. We found that both prediction accuracy and stimulus probability lead to better memory, but through different mechanisms: prediction accuracy boosts the formation of episodic memory, whereas stimulus probability benefits memory by through schema-based inference at retrieval. This study is part of a recent movement to use games to study cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allen et al., 2023)</ref>, since they probe more complex processes than traditional designs while still allowing for precise quantitative modeling. There are especially exciting possibilities for studying schematic prediction and memory with these paradigms, since both participants and computational models can make meaningful predictions about upcoming moves, even for novel board positions. Since moves correspond to spatial positions in 4-ina-row, eye-tracking can provide new insight into predictive processes and adaptive experimental designs. Future work in this field should continue to explore the advantages of using game-based paradigms to study the perception and memory of naturalistic sequences.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>For study 1, we recruited participants through the Columbia University RecruitMe platform. They were paid $30 for the completion of the experiment with up to $10 bonus based on performance in both gameplay and memory task. The study took about 2 hours in total (1 hour gameplay + 1 hour memory task). For study 2, we used the Columbia SONA platform to recruit students seeking research participation credit as part of their introductory psychology classes. We reduced the number of games played by the participants to ensure that the whole experiment took less than the departmental limit of 1.5 hours for SONA participants. All participants were over 18 years of age and gave informed consent for the study. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Columbia University (AAAS0252).</p><p>There were 37 participants for the first study (29 female, 9 male), all with normal or corrected-to-normal vision. These participants had a mean age of 26.02 (SD=7.49).</p><p>The racial makeup of the group consisted of 6 who identified as mixed race, 14 as Asian, 4 as Black or African American, and 13 as White, and 1 who declined to answer. In study 2, a total of 120 participants signed up, and 105 participants completed both the gameplay and memory portions of the experiment. We excluded 9 participants due to failure to follow instructions (N = 3) or extreme difficulty with eye-tracking (N = 6), often due to participants wearing glasses; note that due to the rules for Columbia's SONA program, we were not allowed to apply pre-screening criteria for participants to select only participants who did not require glasses to correct their vision. Data from two participants were lost due to technical errors while running the experiment. The final sample consisted of 94 participants: 35 male, 51 female, and 8 whose demographic information was missing. These participants had a mean age of 20.61 (SD=3.82). The racial makeup of this group consisted of 10 who identified as mixed race, 24 as Asian, 7 as Black or African American, 37 as White, and 6 as other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design &amp; Procedure</head><p>The study was a two-part experiment. Participants first completed an online task where they learned the rule of the 4-in-a-row game and played 40 games to get familiar with it. The gameplay task was built on Psiturk <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Gureckis et al., 2016)</ref> and hosted on Heroku (https://www.heroku.com/). In the second part, they came into the lab and complete the eye-tracking portion. Study 2 design and analyses were preregistered in AsPredicted (AsPredicted #120830).</p><p>Participants played 80 (study 1) or 40 (study 2) games against an AI opponent taken from van Opheusden et al. (2023). The gameplay was completed 1-7 days before the day of their scheduled in-person session. The game is an extension of tic-tactoe, in which two players take turns to add a move on a 4x9 board. The first player to connect four pieces of theirs in a row (either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) on the board wins. Participants were told how to win of the game, and then playing games against an adjustable AI opponent. When the participant won, the AI became stronger, and vice versa. Participants and AIs took turns moving first. They were told the current level of the opponent at every game. They were told to achieve a target level that represents a strong player and (in study 1 only) that their bonus depended on the level they reached.</p><p>For the eye-tracking portion of the experiment, participants came in to the lab, signed the consent form, and performed the memory task. Participants were seated 100 centimeters in front of a monitor and placed their heads in a chin rest 45 centimeters away from the eye-tracker. They were instructed to remain as still as possible while the eye-tracker was running and were told that they could take breaks during the experiment in between blocks. Before beginning the experiment and when the participants returned from their breaks, the eye-tracker calibration and subsequent validation were done using a nine-point grid. We recorded right eye movement using EyeLink 1000 plus at 1000 Hz recording frequency. Light levels remained constant for the duration of the 60 min memory portion of the study. The stimuli were displayed on a 24-inch LED monitor, with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels and a refresh rate of 60 Hz. The outputted EDF files were converted to asc files and parsed with PyGaze <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dalmaijer et al., 2014)</ref>. The experiment was programed with PsychoPy.</p><p>Each of the ten blocks in the memory task consisted of eight trials. For each trial, participants first saw text for one second indicating which color player would be playing this move. This is followed by an initial board for 10 (study 1) or 8 (study 2) seconds, taken from the middle of a game between two AI players as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Huang et al. (2023)</ref>, and then the move was added to the board and shown for 5 sec.</p><p>Participants were instructed to watch and remember the moves. They were told that the boards were taken from the 4-in-a-row game, that the task was difficult, and that they should try to use their knowledge to help them remember. In study they were additionally explicitly instructed to try to guess the location of the move and move their eyes to that location before it appeared. After all eight moves were shown, there was a 15-second distractor task in which random one-digit numbers flashed at the center of the screen every 1 sec and participants were instructed to a button every time an even number appeared. The distractor task was designed to be relatively short because the task of remembering eight moves is highly challenging even at short retention intervals. Participants were then shown the eight initial boards again, one by one, in random order, and recalled the move that was placed on each board by clicking on the corresponding location. After each recall, they also rated their confidence about the move on a scale of 1 to 9 (with 9 being most confident) by pressing the keyboard.</p><p>A persistent technical issue with the eye-tracker sometimes caused the experiment to freeze at random points in the middle of the experiment. In case this happened, we continued the experiment from the next block. This resulted in one or two blocks of missing data in 9 participants in study 1 and 13 participants in study 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fixation smoothing and gameplay model</head><p>We used the same approach for processing fixations and generating probabilities from our gameplay model as our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Huang et al., 2023</ref> for more details). We converted fixations into a distribution of the fixation heatmap in each of the 36 squares on the board, with a small amount of smoothing to handle uncertainty in assigning gaze to squares. The gameplay model is a linear myopic model based on features manually selected for gameplay, trained on games played by strong AI with PyTorch <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Paszke et al., 2019)</ref>. The model outputs a probability distribution of likely next moves. A full description and validation of this model can be found in our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Huang et al., 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Real time generation of the move</head><p>To generate a distribution of a participant's predictions for a board, we obtained a fixation heatmap during the initial board period (10 or 8 sec depending on study).</p><p>Then, the fixations on the empty squares were extracted and normalized such that the fixations sum to one. Similarly, we generated a move probability distribution using the gameplay model.</p><p>To produce an unpredicted / improbable condition, one or both of these distributions could be inverted, such that the probability of a move ( ) became:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ( )) − ( ) ∑ ( ( ( )) − ( )) =0</formula><p>where n is the number of empty squares on the board. This makes the most probable/predicted moves the least likely to occur, while the rest of the moves (originally with near-zero likelihood to occur) became roughly equally likely.</p><p>The final distribution for the next move was calculated by multiplying the two distributions together and normalized such that the distributions sum to one.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ) = ( ) × ( ) ∑ ( ( ) × ( )) =0</formula><p>The move shown to the participants was sampled according to its probability in this combined distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key measures</head><p>For our main analyses, we ignored the binary condition labels under which moves were generated and instead measured prediction accuracy and move probability values for each specific move. Move probability is the log probability according to the gameplay model of the move that was shown. Prediction accuracy is the percent of fixations at empty squares that were focused on the move that was shown. Both move probability and prediction accuracy were z-scored within each study, across all participants and all moves.</p><p>We also derived a model-based measure of schema-based eye movements at retrieval. The fixations during the retrieval period were extracted and converted to heatmaps as described above. For each move, fixations on empty squares were extracted and normalized to sum to 1. We then ran a linear regression with the extracted fixation heatmap as the outcome variable, and two regressors: one consisting of the probability distribution over possible next moves according to the gameplay model, and another that had a value of 0 everywhere except at the square corresponding to the correct move, where its value was 1. The resulting coefficients for these predictors were and .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical models</head><p>All statistical models were fit in R with the lme4 Package <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref>. We started with the most complex model with random subject effects for all regressors.</p><p>In cases where the models did not converge, we simplified the models to reduce the number of random effect terms, until only random intercepts remained in the model.</p><p>For the mediation analysis, the significance of the mediation was computed with the package mediation (Tingley et al., 2014) that uses a bootstrapping procedure.</p><p>Standardized indirect effects were computed for each of the 10,000 bootstrapped samples, and the 95% CI was computed by determining the indirect effects at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-registration</head><p>The experimental design and potential analysis were pre-registered in AsPredicted before we started data collection for study 2. There were some differences in the results we presented and the pre-registration; see the supplementary material for the planned analyses in the pre-registration that were not reported here. We also conducted additional exploratory analyses looking at how retrieval eye movements are related to the probability of the recalled move, to better understand what this measure means in terms of retrieval strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary materials Analyses based on prediction confidence during encoding</head><p>In our pre-registration, we planned to predict memory accuracy, reaction time, and confidence based on three regressors: in addition to the schema-consistency of the move (move probability) prediction accuracy, we also proposed to include a modelfree measure of prediction confidence. Overall, we found that incorporating prediction confidence did not change the main findings of our study and we chose not to include this measure in the main text, but for completeness we report these analyses below.</p><p>Prediction confidence measured the extent to which a participant spent time looking at specific empty squares versus uniformly fixating across all empty squares. High We conducted linear mixed effect logistic regression model, predicting memory from move probability, prediction accuracy, interaction between prediction accuracy and move probability, and move probability, with subject random intercept.</p><p>In study 1 and 2, both move probability and prediction accuracy significantly lead to better memory (p &lt; .001). In both studies, prediction confidence also led to better memory, although the effect is only marginally significant in study 2 (study 1: beta = 0.29, z = 2.87, p = .004; study 2: beta = 0.085, z = 1.71, p = .09). In study 2 only, we found significant interactions between move probability and prediction confidence (t = -0.13, z = -2.42, p = .015), and significant interaction between prediction accuracy and prediction confidence (t = .10, z = 2.50, p = .012). This suggests that memory is better when weakly predicting a move that turned out to be probable, and when strongly predicting a move accurately.</p><p>For the (memory) confidence measure, we found that move probability (t = 2.098, p = 0.04) and prediction accuracy (t = 2.767, p = 0.006), and prediction confidence (t = 2.51, p = 0.01) all led to more confident memory in study 1. Similarly, in study 2, all of the factors led to higher confidence (move probability: t = 8.05, p&lt;.001, prediction accuracy: t = 3.71 p &lt;. 001, prediction confidence t = 3.33 p &lt; .001). None of the interactions were significant.</p><p>For reaction time, prediction confidence was strongly associated with faster reaction time in study 1 (t = -3.524, p &lt; .001) while the other effects were in the same direction but not significant (move probability: t = -1.37, p = .171; prediction accuracy: t = -1.75, p = .079). In study 2, move probability, prediction accuracy, and prediction confidence all predicted faster rt: move probability (t = -3.96, p &lt;.001), prediction accuracy (t = -2.01, p = .044), prediction confidence (t = -7.27, p &lt; .001).</p><p>We also incorporated prediction accuracy into the regression predicting (retrieval schematic eye movement) and . In study 1, higher move probability led to higher (t = 3.3, p = .001), and higher prediction accuracy led to lower (t = -9.82, p &lt; .001). Prediction confidence did not have a significant effect on (t = 1.558, p = .119). The interaction between move probability and prediction accuracy was not significant. In study 2, move probability did not lead to a change in , but prediction accuracy decreased (t = -15.57, p &lt; .001), and prediction confidence increased (t = 2.42, p = .157). There is a significant interaction between move probability and prediction accuracy (t = 2.94, p = .003).</p><p>The same result is found for , but in the opposite direction. In both study 1 and 2, accurate predictions lead to fixation on correct move at retrieval (study 1: t = 20.87, p &lt;.001, study 2: t = 25.61, p &lt; .001), while move probability did not have a main effect (study 1: t = 1.61, p = .109; study 2: t = 0.51, p = .614). Prediction confidence predicted lower in both studies (study 1: t = -2.08, p =.037; study 2: t = -4.24, p &lt;.001). The interactions between move probability and prediction accuracy were also significant in both studies (study 1: t = 2.70, p = .007, study 2: t = 5.66, p &lt; .001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses based on prediction confidence and accuracy at retrieval</head><p>In our pre-registration, we planned to compute three statistics for retrieval eye movements, each corresponding to a measure of prediction in our previous study (prediction coefficient, prediction confidence, prediction accuracy). in retrieval is obtained in a similar way as prediction coefficient during the encoding phase, which we reported in detail. It can be considered as a model-based measure of how much schema is being used during retrieval.</p><p>We also proposed to look at applying the "prediction confidence" and "prediction accuracy" measures to retrieval, as model-free measure of schema use. A high "prediction accuracy" at retrieval would mean that a participant spent a large fraction of the time during recall looking at the correct move. A high "prediction confidence" at retrieval would mean that participants look at only a small number of empty squares during retrieval (low entropy), potentially indicating that they have the subjective experience of a precise episodic memory (whether or not that memory is accurate). To avoid confusion, here we refer to retrieval "prediction confidence" and "prediction accuracy" as "retrieval fixation confidence" and "retrieval fixation accuracy," respectively. retrieval fixation confidence = (log(N empty ) − ∑ ( ) log ( ))</p><p>Note that, unlike the encoding prediction confidence measure above, we do not weight the retrieval fixation confidence based on the time spent fixating on empty squares -retrieval is self-paced, and we would therefore expect the most confident responses to occur very quickly (with relatively little time spent looking at empty squares). Retrieval fixation confidence can be considered a model-free measure of how much participants were debating between different response options, indicating how easy it was to recall the move.</p><p>Using mixed-effects linear regression, we predicted memory accuracy, reaction time, and memory confidence from retrieval fixation confidence and accuracy, with random subject intercepts. We found that moves with high retrieval fixation confidence were more likely to be accurately recalled (study 1: z = 9.92, p &lt; .001; study 2: z = 14.32, p &lt; .001), with higher memory confidence (study 1: t = 15.04, p &lt; .001; study 2: t = 18.45, p &lt; .001), and faster reaction times (study 1: t = -22.98, p &lt; .001; study 2: t = -40.93, p &lt;. 001). Similarly, moves with high retrieval fixation accuracy were better recalled, with higher memory confidence and faster reaction time (all p &lt; .001).</p><p>We then tried to predict retrieval fixation confidence from move probability and prediction accuracy (during encoding). We found that in both studies, accurately predicted moves showed higher retrieval fixation confidence (study 1: t = 7.55, p &lt; .001; study 2: t = 7.62, p &lt; .001). More probable moves also showed higher retrieval fixation confidence (study 1: t = 3.23, p = .001; study 2: t = 3.54, p &lt; .001).</p><p>These results suggest that for probable and/or predicted moves participants considered only a small number of possible responses before making their response. Based on our results in the main text, however, we hypothesize that these effects arise for two different reasons: accurate predictions facilitate precise episodic memory (allowing for quick retrieval of the correct square), while, for probable moves, the move will be one of the first that participants generate (and then recognize) using their schema knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pupillometry analyses</head><p>We also planned in our pre-registration to examine effects on pupil size. This was unfortunately difficult with our paradigm -the participants were constantly moving their eyes to look at different pieces with different luminance at different angles from the center of the screen, which had strong effects on measured pupil size. We first interpolated the size of the pupil during blinking periods using the package MNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gramfort, 2013)</ref>, and then temporally downsampled the pupil timecourse by a factor of 10 (to 100 datapoints per second). For all moves, we built a model to predict pupil size from the distance of the eye from the center of the screen, and the color of the move closest to the location of the eye. We then took the residual of the model and visualized the change as a function of time ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Supplementary Figure 1)</ref>. As can be seen from the figure, the confidence intervals were largely overlapping for moves with varying probability and prediction accuracy. We have therefore chosen not to proceed with additional pupillometry analyses for this paradigm. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Experimental design. a.</figDesc></figure>

As in Huang et al., (2023), we compute this as the expected information gain between a uniform distribution over all empty squares and the fixation distribution. Given the fixation time ( ) for each square , we define ( ) as the fraction of the 5-second window spent fixating on empty squares, and ( ) = ( )/ ( ) as the normalized fixation distribution over empty squares. The information gain from a fixation is 0 for fixations on occupied squares, and for fixations on empty squares reflects the entropy difference between a uniform distribution and the fixation distribution. Therefore, we define: Prediction confidence = (empty) • (log(N empty ) − ∑ ( ) log ( ))</figDesc></figure>
