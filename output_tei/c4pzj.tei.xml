<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>In 1949, Ryle proposed that the cognitive mechanisms employed to understand ourselves are similar to those involved in understanding the feelings and experiences of other people <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Ryle, 1949)</ref>. Since then, various proposals have echoed Ryle in suggesting that explicit metacognition-the capacity for conscious evaluation of one's own mental states <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fleming et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Frith, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012)</ref> and mentalizing-the capacity to evaluate and understand other people's mental states <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abell et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">David et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Rosenblau et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">White et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">White et al., 2011)</ref> have a common neurocomputational basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Carruthers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Dimaggio et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Fleming &amp; Daw, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Frith, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Vaccaro &amp; Fleming, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>According to recent perspectives on the developmental trajectory of metacognition, while "core" or implicit mechanisms for self-monitoring and tracking uncertainty may be in place early in infancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Goupil &amp; Kouider, 2016)</ref>, explicit metacognition emerges around the ages of 2-3 (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Hembacher &amp; Ghetti, 2014</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Goupil &amp; Kouider, 2019</ref> for a review), and continues to be shaped in childhood and adolescence <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Fandakova et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Weil et al., 2013)</ref>. One potential driver of this continued development of explicit metacognition is that a growing understanding of other people's mental states may be used to refine awareness of ourselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Carruthers, 2009)</ref>. For example, repeatedly perceiving a parent expressing uncertainty together with their hesitation may allow a child to recognize and express uncertainty when they themselves are hesitating. This hypothesis predicts that introspection is not a distinct natural kind, but is instead grounded in the same processes used to understand 4 the mental states of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Carruthers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gazzaniga, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gazzaniga, , 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Gopnik, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Wegner, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Wilson, 2002)</ref>. This view makes several testable predictions, for example, that people with a good mentalizing ability should also have good metacognitive ability; and that if children have problems with inferring the mental states of others (e.g., because of a neurodevelopmental condition such as autism), they may also develop difficulties with understanding their own minds.</p><p>The second prediction can be directly studied in the context of Autism Spectrum Condition (ASD)-a neurodevelopmental condition that is, in part, characterised by nonverbal and verbal communicative problems, deficits in socio-emotional reciprocity <ref type="bibr">(American Psychiatric Association, 2013)</ref> and mentalizing difficulties <ref type="bibr">(Happé, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Livingston &amp; Happé, in press</ref>). If our view is correct, difficulties with understanding other people's thoughts and social communication (as is typical in autism) should also affect the development of metacognition in this condition.</p><p>Metacognition is often quantified in laboratory tasks as the ability to provide accurate confidence ratings about self-performance in a range of cognitive domains. "Good" metacognitive ability is indicated by reporting lower confidence when wrong, and higher confidence when right <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fleming et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Frith, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Yeung &amp; Summerfield, 2012)</ref>. This is known as metacognitive "sensitivity" and is distinct from metacognitive "bias", the tendency to be more or less confident overall <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014)</ref>. Mentalizing, on the other hand, is often assessed as participants' ability to understand what agents are thinking or intending from observations of their actions and expressions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abell et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Baron-Cohen et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">White et al., 2011)</ref>. "Good" mentalizing ability is indicated by correct assessment of others' mental states. To date, six studies have examined associations between metacognition and mentalizing in children or adults with autism 5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Carpenter et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Grainger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Nicholson et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Wojcik et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Williams et al., 2018)</ref>. Three of the six papers suggest, in line with the idea that mentalizing and metacognition have a similar neuro-computational mechanism, that autistic individuals have metacognitive difficulties that are commensurate with their mentalizing capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Grainger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Nicholson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Williams et al., 2018)</ref>. However, the remaining three studies did not find deficits in metacognition in autistic compared with nonautistic participants despite finding deficits in mentalizing ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Wojcik et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Carpenter et al., 2019)</ref>. Taken together, the existing data indicate a link between metacognition and mentalizing, but not unequivocally so.</p><p>One difficulty with interpreting findings on metacognition is that its measurement is often confounded by other aspects of task performance, which itself may vary across individuals and clinical groups. For example, many of the studies reviewed above computed people's metacognitive sensitivity as the Goodman-Kruskall gamma correlation between trial-by-trial accuracy and confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Nelson, 1984)</ref>, a measure known to be confounded by type 1 sensitivity (task performance) and metacognitive bias (people's average confidence scores) <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Fleming &amp; Lau, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Masson &amp; Rotello, 2009;</ref>; <ref type="figure">Figure 1a</ref>). The impact of this confound may be particularly pertinent in studies comparing autistic and non-autistic people, as sensory (hyper-) sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ewbank et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Lieder et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Pirrone et al., 2017)</ref> and over-confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(McMahon et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Milne et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Zalla et al., 2015)</ref> are sometimes found to be higher in autistic compared to non-autistic groups. In other words, previously reported measures of metacognitive sensitivity may have been confounded by higher sensory sensitivity in autistic participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6</head><p>A powerful approach to control for task performance confounds in studies of metacognition is to use model-based metrics derived from signal detection theory, that allow metacognitive sensitivity to be expressed in the same units as task performance while also controlling for metacognitive bias <ref type="bibr">(meta-d';</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2012</ref>. Notably, a recent study identifying a positive correlation between metacognitive and mentalizing ability when using this meta-d' metric to quantify metacognitive sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Nicholson et al., 2020</ref>).</p><p>Nicholson and colleagues (2020) measured both implicit (behavioural) and explicit <ref type="bibr">(verbal)</ref> metrics of choice uncertainty (defined as 'opting-out' from choosing or verbally reporting lower confidence, respectively) and measured mentalizing ability from participants' descriptions of short animations of abstract figures that vary in their level of intentionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abell et al., 2000)</ref>. The authors found that explicit, but not implicit, metacognitive sensitivity was positively correlated with mentalizing ability, and significantly lower among autistic children. In a second study on neurotypical adults, the authors leveraged a dual-task condition in which participants completed a mentalizing or non-mentalizing-related cognitive task alongside a metacognition task and found that the dual mentalizing task significantly lowered metacognitive sensitivity compared to conditions in which the dual task did not require mentalizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Nicholson et al., 2020)</ref>. Together these findings suggested that mentalizing and metacognitive ability share a common neurocognitive basis which is commensurately impaired in autistic individuals.</p><p>However, despite this promising result, further limitations in the measurement of both mentalizing and metacognition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Nicholson et al (2020)</ref> are worth considering. First, mentalizing ability was scored from participants' written descriptions of the triangles' mental states. It has been proposed that this type of question is more prone to confounds of verbal fluency than, for example, multiple-choice assessments of mentalizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(White et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>This may be particularly problematic in studies of autism given that differences in verbal fluency are commonly observed in this condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Livingston, Carr, et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Livingston et al., in press;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Spek et al., 2009)</ref>. Second, in the metacognition task, decisions were of varying choice difficulty, with some perceptual discriminations (of colour, or dot density) being easier than others. When task difficulty is varying between trials and subjects, it may affect measures of metacognitive ability, even when d' is controlled for .</p><p>Finally, participants received trial-by-trial feedback on their confidence ratings, where they were rewarded for reporting higher confidence on correct trials and lower confidence on error trials (i.e., better metacognition was incentivized). This may have created a disadvantage for autistic participants who may have difficulties with interpreting and learning from ambiguous or implicit feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Broadbent &amp; Stokes, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Greene et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Reed, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Robic et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Sapey-Triomphe et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Zwart et al., 2018)</ref>. In other words, it could be that the lower metacognitive ability in the autistic group was a consequence of failing to maximize rewards on the basis of the ambiguous feedback.</p><p>Across two studies, we set out to control for some of the factors that might have influenced the results of these previous studies by adopting experimental and computational methods that are considered optimal for the assessment of metacognitive sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Fleming, 2017)</ref>. Specifically, we measured metacognition using a psychophysical task on which participants make repeated perceptual judgements and rated their confidence in being correct. In order to match sensory sensitivity across participants and over the course of the experiment within the same participant, we employed a staircase procedure that continually adjusted sensory evidence strength on the basis of people's responses. In addition, we measured the same participants' mentalizing ability on a separate task in which they watched short animations of abstract figures that moved across the screen according to distinct types of interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abell et al., 2000)</ref>, similar to that used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Nicholson et al. (2020)</ref>. Instead of providing a verbal description of each interaction, participants indicated their answer using multiple choice selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">(White et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Livingston et al., in press)</ref>. We controlled for type 1 performance in the measurement of metacognition by computing metacognitive efficiency (meta-d'/d'), which controls for type 1 sensitivity and metacognitive bias using the meta-d' model <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Maniscalco &amp; Lau, 2012</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, we estimated metacognitive efficiency within a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows optimal estimation of the relationship between metacognitive efficiency and individual differences in mentalizing ability, while also taking into account uncertainty surrounding each individual subject's parameter estimates <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Fleming, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Harrison et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Having confirmed a link between metacognition and mentalizing, in a second set of analyses we investigated how the computation of confidence is modulated by mentalizing ability by building hierarchical regression models of trial-by-trial confidence ratings. We reasoned that, if metacognition and mentalizing rely on similar inferential processes and cues, mentalizing ability should facilitate the use of behavioural cues that are similarly predictive of the mental states of others. Work in cognitive psychology has often shown that people have poor access to the reasons for their actions but instead infer these from contextual cues (even if these cues are experimentally decoupled from the true underlying intention; <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Gazzaniga, 1995</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Gazzaniga, , 2000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Nisbett &amp; Wilson, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Wegner, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Wilson, 2002)</ref>. For example, when asked to rate their confidence in a previous decision, people's confidence reports may be affected by various (behavioural) cues that are more or less related to the decision, such as response times <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kiani et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Patel et al., 2012)</ref>, social context <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">( Bang et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">( Bang et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> Van der Plas et al., 2021), as well as the quantity and reliability of evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">De Martino et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Pleskac &amp; Busemeyer, 2010)</ref>. Intriguingly, response times have been shown to have a causal impact on the confidence levels people ascribe not only to themselves, but also to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Palser et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Patel et al., 2012)</ref>. In a series of exploratory analyses, we therefore asked whether confidence was more tightly coupled to response times among participants with better mentalizing ability.</p><p>In two independent behavioural experiments, we tested three pre-registered premises of the hypothesis that metacognition and mentalizing are inter-related, namely that: (1) metacognition and mentalizing ability are positively correlated, even after controlling for first-order performance; (2) metacognitive efficiency is lower in people with autism, and in participants with greater autistic traits; and (3) especially in those with greater difficulties with social communication and understanding but not non-social autistic traits. We also assessed the extent to which response times predict confidence on a trail-by-trial level by conducting exploratory hierarchical regression models, asking whether the predictions of confidence interacted with mentalizing ability. Participants. We recruited N = 501 proficient English speaking participants via Prolific (https://www.prolific.com), a recruitment platform more representative of real populations than standard student samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Palan &amp; Schitter, 2018)</ref>. All participants accessed the experiment with a desktop computer or laptop (no tablets or smartphones). Exclusion criteria were responding incorrectly to a "catch" question (e.g., "If you are still paying attention, please select x as your answer"); performing below or above pre-defined accuracy cut-offs (60% and 90% respectively) on the metacognition task; or rating the same confidence on more than 90% of the trials on the metacognition task. This resulted in the exclusion of N = 23 participants (5% of the total sample), leaving N = 477 participants for further analysis (168 female, mean age: 28.73, SEM = 0.52 years). All participants gave informed consent before the experiment, which was approved by the University College London Ethics Committee (1260/003).</p><p>Metacognition task. Stimuli were programmed in JavaScript using JSPsych <ref type="bibr">(version 5.0.3)</ref> and hosted on the online research platform Gorilla (https://gorilla.sc//). Participants made 168 decisions across four blocks concerning which box was filled with a higher density of dots (left or right, indicated by pressing the "W" or "E" key, respectively without a time limit).</p><p>The boxes were two black squares (each 250 x 250 pixels) which were each subdivided into grids of 625 cells that were filled with 313 dots. Choice difficulty was manipulated by adjusting the dot difference between boxes according to a "2-down-1-up" staircase procedure: dot difference increased after every error and decreased after two consecutive correct answers. Dots seemed to flicker, an effect created by replotting five different configurations of the same dot difference level for 150 ms each, for a full stimulus duration of 750 ms . On 26 practice trials participants received immediate feedback. During the remaining trials, participants did not receive feedback but had to rate their confidence that their decision was correct (on a scale from 1 "Guessing" to 6 "Certainly correct", without a time limit; Rouault et al., 2018).</p><p>Mentalizing task. We used a validated online version of the Frith-Happé Triangle Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abell et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Livingston et al., in press</ref>). Participants were shown twelve short (34-35 sec.) animations of one large red and one small blue triangle. The way in which the triangles moved was manipulated across three conditions: in random animations they moved purposelessly around; in Goal-Directed animations they interacted behaviourally; and in four Theory of Mind (ToM) animations they interacted in a way that involves responding to the other's mental states. Participants were scored on their accuracy in classifying which category the interaction pertained to (mentalizing classification) giving a score ranging between 0-12 (i.e., participants could score one point after each animation). In addition, we computed participants' accuracy in categorizing the feelings of the triangles (mentalizing ability; <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">White et al., 2011)</ref>. Mentalizing ability was scored as the number of correctly identified mental states of each of the two triangles, after each ToM animation that had been correctly identified in the mentalizing classification question. This type of mental state attribution requires tracking the triangle's intentions throughout the animation and cannot simply be deduced from the general kinematics of the triangle, therefore making it less susceptible to compensatory strategies. Participants had to watch the complete animation before the questions appeared, after which they were allowed to decide without a time limit.</p><p>All animations were presented in pseudo-randomized order and after three practice animations on which participants received immediate feedback.</p><p>Additional measures.

Exclusion criteria were the same as in Experiment 1. Three participants were excluded: one participant performed below the a priori accuracy cut-off and two participants performed above the a priori accuracy cut-off. This resulted in the exclusion of N = participants (7.5% of the total sample, which is consistent with Experiment 1), leaving data from N=40 participants for analysis (37 female, mean age: 37.90, SEM = 1.59 years). All participants gave informed consent before experiment onset which was approved by the participants scoring in the lowest 50% quantile of RAADS-14 and AQ-10 responses (a score lower than 16 and 5, respectively, which is more stringent than the clinical cut-off score; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ashwood et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Eriksson et al., 2013)</ref>. Next, to ensure the groups were well-matched on other characteristics, for each included autistic participant we manually selected a comparison participant of similar gender (a high proportion of females in the autism group meant that it was not possible to find a 1:1 gender match for three participants); who was within ±5 years from the target age; ±2 levels from the target education; and ±5 ICAR points from the target fluid intelligence level.

The left panel represents a decider with low confidence; the right panel represents a decider with high confidence. Metacognitive sensitivity is defined as the separation in confidence between correct and incorrect decisions; metacognitive bias is the overall confidence expressed. b. On the metacognition task, participants made judgments about which patch with dots had a higher density (left or right). After this, they were asked to rate their confidence on a scale from 1 "Guessing" to 6 "Certainly correct". On the mentalizing task, participants watched animations of moving triangles and were asked to categorize and interpret the interaction of the triangles.</p><p>We next investigated the hypothesis of a positive association between metacognitive efficiency and mentalizing ability within the hierarchical meta-d' model. When we examined the beta coefficient representing the impact of mentalizing ability on metacognitive efficiency, the HDI was positive and did not encompass zero (hierarchical estimation: 95% HDI [0.01, 0.09]), with 99% of the sampled beta values being higher than zero ( (HDI mentalizing ability &gt; 0) = 0.99; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2a</ref>) indicating a significant positive relationship.</p><p>To confirm this effect while controlling for covariates of age, gender, IQ and education, we used a linear regression model with the standardized log metacognitive efficiency from a single-subject model as a dependent variable and mentalizing ability and these covariates as predictor variables.

Specifically, we estimated a hierarchical mixed-effects model predicting trial-bytrial explicit confidence levels on the metacognition task from differences in standardized log response times (logRT) and accuracy [error: -0.5, correct: 0.5] (Equation 2.1), and asked whether this model provided a better fit when these predictors were allowed to vary as a function of the participants' mentalizing ability <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Equation 2.2)</ref>. A Likelihood Ratio Test indicated that this was the case ( 2 (4) = 27.59, P = 1.51e-05) which was also confirmed by We next asked how mentalizing modulated the construction of confidence by investigating which predictor variables interacted with mentalizing ability. We found that participants with better mentalizing ability reported lower overall confidence in their own responses than participants with lower mentalizing ability (hierarchical linear regression, main effect of mentalizing ability: 2 (1) = 6.08, P = 0.01,  = -0.04, SE = 0.02). In addition, participants with higher mentalizing ability scores modulated their confidence ratings more on the basis of their response times than participants with lower scores of mentalizing ability  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confidence was negatively related to response times (logRT). Trial-by-trial response times have a higher impact on the estimated confidence of participants scoring above the median of mentalizing ability scores (in turquoise) than participants scoring below the median (in pink). Shaded area represents the Standard Deviation from the Mean (±SDM).</head><p>Next, we addressed the second hypothesis of a negative association between metacognitive efficiency and autistic traits in the general population, as assessed with the AQ-10 (Allison et al., 2012) and the RAADS-14 questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Eriksson et al., 2013)</ref>. First, we evaluated whether participants with higher scores of autistic traits had lower mentalizing ability, by conducting a linear regression model with mentalizing ability as the dependent variable and autistic trait scores and the covariates (age, gender, education, IQ) as predictor variables. We found the expected negative relationship between mentalizing ability and RAADS-14 scores (linear regression model:  −14 = -0.002, SE = 0.0009, t476 = -2.21, P = 0.03) but not AQ-10 scores (linear regression model:  10 = 0.006, SE = 0.004, t476 = 1.33, P = 0.19). This unexpected finding, together with recent re-evaluations of the reliability of the AQ-10 scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bertrams, 2021)</ref>, and the greater developmental information captured by the RAADS-14, led us to focus on RAADS-14 scores in the remainder of the analyses.</p><p>Next, we asked whether compromised mentalizing ability in participants with higher scores of autistic traits was associated with lower metacognitive efficiency. To test this, we estimated the correlation between metacognitive efficiency and RAADS-14 scores within a hierarchical regression model. The 95% HDI for the coefficient of RAADS-14 scores was negative on average, ranging from [-0.057, 0.019], but encompassed zero (hierarchical estimation: ( &lt; 0) = 0.82). A frequentist linear model that controlled for the covariates also confirmed that participants with higher scores of autistic traits do not necessarily also have compromised metacognitive efficiency (linear regression model:  14 = -0.05, SE = 0.05, t476 = -1.09, P = 0.28).</p><p>An alternative explanation hypothesis is that autistic traits as measured by the RAADS-14 do not have a direct impact on the metacognitive efficiency score, but rather affect the construction of confidence. To examine this, we tested if our mixed-effect hierarchical regression model better predicts trial-by-trial confidence levels on the metacognition task when the predictors (accuracy, logRT and their interactions) were allowed to vary as a function of differences in autistic traits. A Likelihood Ratio Test indeed suggests that an interaction term on autistic traits improved the fit of the model ( 2 (4) = 14.52, P = 0.006) which was further confirmed by several goodness-of-fit metrics (LL: 7, BIC: -31, AIC: 7 and Deviance: -15), indicating that the computation of confidence differs as a function of individual differences in autistic traits.</p><p>We next asked in what way people with higher scores for autistic traits constructed their confidence differently, by testing which predictor variables interacted with RAADS-14 scores. We found that participants with higher scores for autistic traits reported lower confidence overall (hierarchical linear regression, main effect of RAADS-14: 2 (1) = 4.86, P = 0.027,  = -0.008, SE = 0.004). In addition, explicit confidence was more informed by logRT among participants with lower scores for autistic traits than among participants with higher scores for autistic traits (interaction effect of logRT x RAADS-14: 2 (1) = 6.46, P = 0.011,  = 0.004, SE = 0.001). In <ref type="figure">Figure 3a</ref> we plot the extracted beta coefficients of the impact of response times on confidence for participants scoring above and below the median cut-off on autistic traits on error and correct trials separately, which shows that this effect was driven by participants with higher autistic trait scores having a lower impact of response times on error-trials than participants with lower autistic traits (three-way interaction of logRT x RAADS-14 x accuracy: 2 (1) = 4.63, P = 0.031,  = -0.003, SE = 0.001). Together these results suggest that participants with higher autistic traits use response times less to infer they have committed an error than participants with lower autistic trait scores.</p><p>These results suggest that compromised mentalizing ability may specifically affect the relationship between response times and confidence. We next asked whether specifically social aspects of the autistic phenotype, rather than non-social aspects, negatively impact metacognition. In an exploratory analysis we estimated the correlation between metacognitive efficiency and self-reported social skills with hierarchical regression models.</p><p>This analysis revealed that participants with self-reported difficulties in everyday types of social interaction, measured by the 'mentalizing' sub-scale of the RAADS-14, had lower metacognitive efficiency than participants with better self-reported social skills (hierarchical   In summary, in Experiment 1 we found a metacognitive benefit for participants with better mentalizing ability. We further disentangled the mechanism of this effect by showing that mentalizing ability is associated with a tighter coupling between response times and confidence in errors. Metacognition was less efficient in participants with higher scores for autistic traits, in particular, among participants who report greater difficulties with selfreported social difficulties. Together these results provide initial evidence that metacognitive processes are related to mentalizing capacity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>In Experiment 1 we found that metacognitive and mentalizing abilities are related, potentially by affecting the extent to which response times modulate confidence. Against our expectation, we did not find a statistically significant negative correlation between autistic traits and metacognitive efficiency. One explanation of this null result is that the variation in autistic traits was not pronounced enough in our general population sample to allow estimation of this relationship. In Experiment 2 we sought to compare data from N = 40 autistic participants recruited via the charity organization Autistica to a matched comparison group of N = 40 participants subsampled from the dataset of Experiment 1. As a result of the selection procedure described in Methods, both groups had similar age (independent samples t-test, t78 = 0.90, P = 0.37), gender (independent samples t-test, t78 = 1.07, P = 0.29), education (Mautism = 4.00, SE = 0.06; Mcomparison = 3.92, SE = 0.19; independent samples t-test, t78 = 0.25, P = 0.80) and IQ scores (Mautism = 9, SE = 0.54; Mcomparison = 7.90, SE = 0.52; independent samples t-test, t76 = 1.45, P = 0.15). In addition, as a result of the calibration procedure, first-order performance on the metacognition task was not statistically different between groups (Mautism = 0.75, SE = 0.01; Mcomparison = 0.74, SE = 0.008; independent samples t-test, t78 = 0.52, P = 0.60; see Supplementary Material for other reliability checks).</p><p>Having shown that the two groups were matched in terms of demographics and general cognitive ability, we next asked if autistic participants had lower mentalizing ability than comparison participants by testing a linear regression model with mentalizing ability as independent variable and clinical group [autism: -0.5, comparison: 0.5] and the covariates (age, gender, IQ, and education) as predictor variables. When we do this, we find that mentalizing ability was indeed lower for autistic participants than comparison participants, but not significantly so (linear regression:  = -0.43 (0.25), 68 = -1.72, P = 0.089).</p><p>Next, we use a similar linear regression model to test if the autism group had lower  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 4b)</ref>, although did not reach significance at the classical 95% threshold.

A likelihood ratio test indicated that this was the case ( 2 (4) = 966.46, &lt; 2.20e -16 ) which was further strongly confirmed by goodness-of-fit indices (LL: -484, AIC: 958, BIC: 929 and Deviance: 966), supporting the prediction that confidence formation in autistic participants is qualitatively distinct to comparison participants.</p><p>Consistent with the results of Experiment 1 we found that autistic participants report lower confidence than comparison participants in general (hierarchical regression model, main effect of group: 2 (1) = 768.50, &lt; 2.0e -16 , = 0.82, = 0.03). Autistic participants show a marginally lower impact of response times in error trials than comparison participants (three-way interaction logRT x group x accuracy: 2 (1) = 3.086, = 0.060, = 0.10, = 0.06). In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 4c</ref> we plot the impact of response times on confidence on error and correct trials separately, which shows that the negative impact of RT on confidence was less negative in autistic participants than in comparison participants, suggesting a weaker influence on response times on confidence in error trials. In summary, in Experiment 2 we show that metacognitive efficiency is compromised in autism and reveal a weaker association between response times and confidence in autistic participants in contrast to matched comparison participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Across two behavioural experiments we show that mentalizing ability is positively related to metacognition. In a general population sample of N = 477 participants we found that individuals who were better at self-reported social skills and mentalizing could also more reliably track their own accuracy on a perceptual discrimination task. By investigating the trial-by-trial computations of confidence, we were able to investigate precisely how mentalizing relates to metacognition. Notably, mentalizing ability was associated with a tighter coupling between response times and confidence, suggesting that mentalizing ability may facilitate inference on cues to self-performance. In a second dataset with autistic participants, we show that the mentalizing difficulties that characterize this condition are associated both with compromised metacognitive ability and replicate the findings of Experiment 1 that autistic traits are associated with a weaker link between response times and confidence. Together, these findings suggest that processes involved in inferring other people's mental states may also facilitate self-directed metacognition, and vice versa.</p><p>We quantified metacognition as the ability to reliably separate correct from incorrect decisions with confidence ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Flavell, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fleming et al., 2010;</ref>. Several studies have suggested confidence is 'read out' from how much reliable evidence has been seen, either during the course of the decision itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Pleskac &amp; Busemeyer, 2010)</ref> or after an initial decision has been made (postdecisional evidence processing; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Fleming et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Resulaj et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Talluri et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">van den Berg et al., 2016)</ref>. Other studies suggest that response times also provide a behavioural cue to confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kiani et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Patel et al., 2012)</ref>. How, then, might mentalizing play a role in confidence construction? Recent theoretical models suggest that confidence estimates reflect an inference about the state of the decider, informed by behavioural and cognitive cues-suggesting a computational parallel between self-and otherevaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Fleming &amp; Daw, 2017)</ref>. Indeed, evidence strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2017)</ref> and response times <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Patel et al., 2012)</ref> appear to be used similarly to infer both one's own and others' confidence. However, isolating such metacognitive capacity requires tight control over the evidence going into a decision, to avoid first-order performance and stimulus factors confounding estimates of the confidence-accuracy correlation <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Masson &amp; Rotello, 2009;</ref>. Here we used a staircase procedure to control perceptual performance within a narrow range and used a metric of metacognition that is unconfounded by both metacognitive bias and first-order performance. In addition, we used a Bayesian inference approach to estimate the impact of mentalizing ability on metacognitive ability within the same hierarchical model, which ensured that both within-and between-subject variability are appropriately taken into account. These methodological advances may explain why here we found a more robust between-subjects relationship between metacognition and mentalizing than reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Carpenter et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Nicholson et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Our results are also in line with previous work on autism, suggesting that metacognitive ability may be compromised in autistic individuals to a similar extent to the ability to evaluate other people's mental states. Autism was characterised as a general "mindblindness" in 1985 (Simon <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Baron-Cohen et al., 1985)</ref> but, since then, only a handful of studies have extended the study of mentalizing in autism to that of metacognitive ability about one's own behaviour and mental states <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Carpenter et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Grainger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Nicholson et al., 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Nicholson et al., , 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">Williams et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Wojcik et al., 2013)</ref>. Some of these studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Grainger et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Nicholson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Williams et al., 2018)</ref> but not others <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Carpenter et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Wojcik et al., 2013)</ref>, found, in line with our pre-registered hypotheses and findings, that mentalizing and metacognitive ability were commensurately compromised in autism. A notable exception to this general picture is that we unexpectedly found that self-reported autistic traits on the RAADS-14 were not negatively associated with metacognitive efficiency in our general population dataset of Experiment 1. One candidate explanation for this inconsistency is that variation in autistic traits in the general population may not have been pronounced enough to find statistically significant differences in metacognitive efficiency. Another explanation is that metacognitive ability in autism may not be worse on average but rather more extreme (both extremely strong and weak; <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Pariser, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Shields-Wolfe &amp; Gallagher, 1992)</ref>-as hinted at by the greater variance in the autistic group estimates (see overlayed dots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 4a</ref>). Future studies should investigate whether this is the case in larger samples and, if so, whether it can be attributed to autistic people engaging in alternative, perhaps more cognitively demanding, processes to compensate for metacognitive difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Livingston, Colvert, et al., 2019;</ref>.</p><p>Given the range of cues people may use to inform confidence, it will be important for future studies to focus on how the construction of confidence or other mentalizing processes varies across participants. It could be that, in real life, the metacognitive ability of some autistic people is above average but achieved via different routes than those studied in this experiment.</p><p>Our work goes beyond estimating correlations between metacognition and mentalizing by revealing a potential mechanism through which mentalizing may affect metacognitive processes. Specifically, we show that better mentalizing ability is associated with a tighter coupling between response times and confidence. Previous work has experimentally manipulated response times and found this to have a causal effect on the construction of confidence: when response times are manipulated to be faster, people are subsequently more likely to report being confident <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Kiani et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Palser et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The mentalizing-is-prior theory suggests metacognition consists of a re-application of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Carruthers, 2009)</ref>. Our findings are consistent with this view, showing that people with greater proficiency in self-reported social skills and objectively measured mentalizing also had better metacognitive efficiency. In addition, we found that mentalizing ability not only correlated with overall metacognitive efficiency, but specifically with the ability to infer confidence from behavioural cues that would also be visible markers of other people's decision confidence in everyday situations. An important limitation of the current study is that we cannot draw causal conclusions about how mentalizing affects metacognition or vice versa. Future longitudinal work is needed to ask whether exposure to situations requiring mental state inference from behaviour causally affects the development of explicit metacognition. Another limitation of this study is that of domain-generality. There is reason to believe that metacognitive efficiency measured from perceptual decision-making is similar to metacognitive efficiency measured in other domains, such as from mnemonic or numerical decision-making tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bronfman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Rouault, McWilliams, et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Talluri et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">van der Plas et al., 2021)</ref>. However, other studies found selective differences in perceptual metacognition between groups, in the absence of differences in memory metacognition . The possibility of dissociations between domains suggests an unlikely, albeit possible, chance that mentalizing ability is only related to metacognitive efficiency when the latter is measured in the context of a perceptual task.</p><p>Future studies should test the interplay between metacognition and mentalizing across a wider range of cognitive domains.</p><p>In summary, across two behavioural experiments we demonstrate that mentalizing ability is associated with both greater metacognitive efficiency, and tighter links between response times and confidence. In a general population sample, participants with better social skills were also better at reflecting upon their own performance. In a second dataset we show that autistic participants with generally lower mentalizing ability also had weaker metacognitive ability, in the absence of differences in first-order performance. Together, these results suggest that inferring other people's mental states is related to the ability to evaluate our own decisions.</p></div>

In addition, to establish whether the autistic trait surveys and Frith-Happé triangle task were measuring a similar mentalizing construct, we tested whether people with more autistic traits on the mentalizing subscale of the RAADS-14 also had lower mentalizing ability on the Frith-Happé Triangle Task, which was also the case (Spearman's r = -0.11, P = 0.017).</p><p>We next sought to ensure key variables related to metacognition and mentalizing were independent of first-order perceptual task performance. We first calculated each individual's experienced stimulus variability (the ratio between the standard deviation of stimulus difficulty and average stimulus difficulty) and correlated this with the main variables of interest. Staircase variability was not correlated with mentalizing ability (rs475 = 0.005, P = 0.91; <ref type="figure">Supplementary   Figure 1</ref>.2a) metacognitive efficiency (rs475 = -0.068, P = 0.137; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Supplementary Figure   1.2b)</ref>, RAADS-14 scores (rs475 = 0.0015, P = 0.974; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Supplementary Figure 1.2c)</ref> or AQ-10 scores (rs475 = -0.066, P = 0.149; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Supplementary Figure 1.2d)</ref>.

More details on these questionnaires are provided in Supplementary Materials. Statistics. The hypotheses and analyses for this study were pre-registered (https://osf.io/vgy7a/). Validation checks are reported in the Supplementary Material and consisted of Spearman's rho correlations (which are recommended for ordinal data) to assess relationships between main composite survey scores. Equal variances were assumed if not otherwise specified. We report P values at a 0.05 alpha level and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the test statistic. Type-1 cognitive and type-2 metacognitive parameters were estimated using the open source HMeta-d toolbox (https://github.com/metacoglab/Hmeta-d) implemented in MATLAB (version 9.7.0). Type-2 − ′, the ability to determine one's accuracy with confidence ratings, was inferred using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian sampling procedures using JAGS (http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net) across 30,000 samples after a burn-in of 1,000 samples distributed across three chains. Our parameter of interest was Mratio (meta-d'/d'), or metacognitive efficiency, which expresses metacognitive sensitivity (meta-d') relative to task performance (d'; in other words, an Mratio of 1 implies participants have optimal metacognitive efficiency; Fleming, 2017).</figDesc></figure>
