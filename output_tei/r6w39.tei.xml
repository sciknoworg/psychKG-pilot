			<abstract>
				<p>Inspired by economic theory, theorists in neuroeconomics and related areas of cognitive science contend that value serves as a common currency for selection among options. While impressive support for this view has amassed over the last three decades, critics have raised serious concerns. They argue that there are a number of pathways to action that bypass value; dissimilar psychological systems do not share a common value currency; and the view cannot accommodate well documented kinds of &quot;irrationality,&quot; such as context effects. This essay offers a systematic response. Key refinements are made to the common currency view, distinguishing common currencies that operate at two phases (decision-phase and learning-phase) and at two levels (options-level and meta-level). A further distinction is made between mechanistic common currency models utilized in cognitive science and representational common currency models that are formulated in expected utility theory and utilized in economics. These refinements help address the criticisms and yield a more nuanced understanding of the role of value in human decision-making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>What explains why people do the things they do? Many influential answers have been given <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Behaviorists proposed learned associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>; ethologists appealed to intrapsychic hydraulic forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>; religious thinkers invoked an immaterial self that is the ultimate chooser.</p><p>Contemporary computational cognitive science, specifically the field of neuroeconomics, offers a distinctive answer inspired by economic theory: People make decisions about what to do based on information about the expected value of their options, and they choose the option with highest value <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Value is a scalar variable that represents the subjective goodness or badness of an option, similar in some ways to the role played by utility in economic theories.</p><p>Critically, value also plays the role of a "common currency" for comparing options <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. People make decisions that trade off very different kinds of goods, for example food, money, safety, leisure, and social gains, among other things. Theorists claim that value serves as a common medium of exchange that allows for selection among dissimilar alternatives.</p><p>Another argument starts with the observation that the human brain is outfitted with numerous mechanisms and systems that contribute to choice and action guidance, many of which operate using distinctive computational principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. For example, some systems rely on a model of the world, other systems use "model-free" methods, still others use Pavlovian principles, and so forth. These observations raise doubts about whether there is a common medium of value that is shared across all these disparate systems allowing for commensuration across them A third argument says that representing the value of one's options, while it certainly happens in some cases, is in fact relatively rare because it is much too computationally demanding. Instead, people use heuristics to rapidly select among a set of options without having to exhaustively calculate the value of the options <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>. It is now well established that heuristics are employed ubiquitously in human decision-making, and this fact is said to challenge the common currency view <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>A fourth argument says the common currency view, inspired by economic theory, has trouble accounting for certain forms of "irrationality." People display a number of welldocumented context effects-their preferences change depending on seemingly irrelevant features of the context in which they are elicited. Critics argue the common currency view of choice cannot account for these phenomena <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Defending the Common Currency View</head><p>The aim of this essay is to systematically defend the common currency view against these criticisms while acknowledging that the critics' arguments involve key insights and yield important lessons. Three distinctions play key roles throughout the essay.</p><p>The first distinction is between two phases at which a common currency can operate. Most theorists have assumed that a common currency of value will be implemented at the decision-phase, i.e., at the time that an agent confronts a decision among options. But there is an alternative approach in which a common currency is utilized during the learning phase to learn optimal actions, and the agent does not necessarily need to access the common currency at the time of decision.</p><p>The second distinction is between two levels at which a common currency of value can operate. A common currency can be used to adjudicate among dissimilar options ("options-level currency") or among competing systems or processes ("meta-level currency"). Meta-level valuation, it is argued, fills in a key gap: It helps to explain how the common currency thesis can still be maintained even when there is no shared medium of value available in which the options themselves can be directly compared.</p><p>The third distinction is between a representational and a mechanistic common currency. Standard expected utility theory from economics uses value to represent an agent's observed pattern of preferences over options. In neuroeconomics and related areas of cognitive science, in contrast, value is a mentally represented dimension that is used as a mechanism to quantify and compare the goodness or badness of the options. This distinction between representational and mechanistic common currency models is critical for accommodating and explaining "irrational" choice patterns.</p><p>The essay is divided into five parts. Part 1 clarifies the common currency view and summarizes some initial evidence from neuroeconomics and other areas of cognitive science in its favor. The next four parts take up four major arguments against the common currency view put forward by critics. It is argued that when key clarifications are made and certain misconceptions are addressed, the observations made by critics of the common currency view are seen to no longer count against it. Indeed, in many cases, these observations end up providing additional strong support for the common currency model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">An Initial Case for the Common Currency View</head><p>The common currency view says that when an agent confronts a decision involving competing alternatives, a common currency of value is used to resolve the question of which alternative to select. A common currency of value is a single continuous dimension that represents the expected goodness or badness of the options and enables comparisons among potentially dissimilar alternatives. It is called a currency rather than a mere ordering because the dimension allows fine-grained magnitude information to be represented. In particular, the dimension must enable representation of the magnitudes of the values of alternatives, or magnitudes of differences among the values of the alternatives, on a single shared scale.</p><p>There are several lines of evidence that yield a compelling initial case for the common currency view.</p><p>One line of evidence come from the reinforcement learning (RL) framework, which addresses the problem of how agents learn to behave in complex environments in ways that maximize achievement of their aims <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. There are a number of importantly different kinds of algorithms within the RL framework. The focus for now is on "value-based" algorithms, such as the temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> (socalled "value-free" RL algorithms are discussed in the following section).</p><p>In the RL framework, an agent has a prespecified reward function, which identifies the things that count as "intrinsic goals" for the agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>. These might include such things as nourishment, safety, and so forth, and each is associated with a scalar value that quantifies its degree of importance to the agent. In value-based RL algorithms, the agent next uses feedback from the environment to learn the expected values of its actions in terms of cumulative future reward attainment. These expected value representations sum over potentially dissimilar reward types (i.e., dissimilar intrinsic goals such as nourishment and safety), thus allowing comparison of options in terms of a common currency of value.</p><p>There is substantial evidence that value-based RL algorithms do in fact play wide-ranging roles across multiple areas of cognition, including attention allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, habitual action <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, and executive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. These observations, in turn, provide compelling evidence for the common currency view. This because the view says that agents use a common currency of value to select the option with highest value. Value-based RL algorithms provide one important explanation, though certainly not the only one, for where information about the value of options ultimately comes from.</p><p>Another line of evidence for the common currency view comes from neuroimaging studies in which people are presented with goods of various kinds and their brain activation patterns are quantified. These studies have identified several neural regions, most prominently ventral striatum and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, that exhibit a trio of features. First, their activation scales with the expected value of the presented goods such that larger expected values, for example, larger expected monetary gains, are associated with stronger activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Second, these regions activate to a very broad range of goods, including food, attractive faces, monetary rewards, consumer items, social gains, and moral outcomes, among others <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Third, activation in these regions is predictive of exchange rates or actual choice patterns among these goods <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>. These observations have led some theorists to propose that these regions encode a common currency of value that enables choice over disparate option types <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</p><p>Still another line of evidence for the common currency view comes from computational models of multiattribute decisions, such as decision field theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref> and other sequential sampling-based models of preferential choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. These models are often applied to decision problems involving options with highly dissimilar attributes, for example vehicles that differ on cost, safety, and style. To enable comparisons across dissimilar dimensions, these models make a basic assumption that the agent can directly make pairwise comparisons of how much better an option is versus another option along a specific attribute dimension, i.e., the agent can make attribute-wise relative value assessments. Moreover, it is assumed value information arising from these comparisons can be additively summed up across comparisons involving different attributes. In short, then, these models make the assumption that value serves as a common scalar medium of comparison across dissimilar attributes and across options. Importantly, the substantial empirical success of these models in capturing a range of behavioral phenomena, including patterns of choice and reaction time <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>, provides evidence that this assumption is correct.</p><p>Finally, there is a venerable theoretical argument for the common currency model, which might be dubbed the "How else?" argument (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> for somewhat different versions of this general argument).</p><p>Value provides a highly efficient and parsimonious medium in which to encode countless tradeoffs across dissimilar goods, and to adjust these tradeoffs based on ongoing experience via learning algorithms (for example, RL algorithms). Without the use of value for this purpose, encoding tradeoffs between even just two goods becomes prohibitively complex (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> for a detailed argument and <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for a compelling illustration). Moreover, there is the further problem of how to adjust these tradeoffs if the goods change in decision-relevant ways-for example, if a certain food item no longer yields certain anticipated benefits. Based on these sorts of observations, theorists argue that value is a highly efficient solution to a ubiquitous problem, explaining why the use of value is widespread across psychological domains.</p><p>These four lines of evidence make a strong initial case for the common currency view. Yet, a number is serious objections have been raised to the view, and these are discussed in the next four sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Policy Gradients: Do Some RL Learning Algorithms Bypass Value?</head><p>"Value-Free" RL Algorithms Many RL algorithms, such as the temporal difference algorithm, are value-based: They learn the expected value of the available options, enabling comparisons of these options in a common scale. Thus, they provide solid support for the common currency view.</p><p>But there are some RL algorithms that are said to be "value-free." For example, so-called policy gradient methods are said to arrive at an action policy "directly" without calculating value <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Policy gradient algorithms, or closely related algorithms such as actor-critic methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, also have strong plausibility as algorithms implemented in the human brain, especially as a basis of routinized action control <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>. This fact potentially presents a serious problem for the common currency view: Policy gradient methods point to the presence of important pathways to action that bypass value. However, as will be argued, a closer look at the workings of policy gradient algorithms calls this line of criticism into doubt.</p><p>In policy gradient algorithms, the agent assigns so-called action weights to its actional options for each environmental state, where these weights encode the probability of performing the associated action (the collection of action weights assigned across all states is called a "policy"). These action weights can initially be set randomly. The agent next observes rewards that arise from its actions as it navigates its environment (each full traversal of its environment is called an "episode"). The agent uses these observations from each episode to, via a gradient-based method, nudge the action weights up or down. That is, actions that were observed in an episode to yield higher subsequent total rewards are nudged up and these actions are, going forward, performed with higher probability; actions observed to yield lower subsequent total rewards are correspondingly nudged down. It can be shown that repeated application of this gradient-based process can converge on an optimal policy for action <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>Hayden and Niv <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> argue that that an agent selecting its actions through policy gradient methods does not choose their actions based on value. A policy gradient agent acts on the basis of action weights-these weights determine the probability of performing the respective actions. These weights, they argue, do not convey information about the value of the corresponding actions. Instead, they are more like direct recommendations for how to act.</p><p>For example, suppose a policy gradient algorithm is used to learn action weights for the children's game rock/papers/scissors, and eventually learns an optimal policy: 1/3 weight assigned to each action. These action weights do not represent the value of the respective actions. Rather, they are recommendations that one should perform each action 1/3 of the time. Hayden and Niv thus conclude that policy gradient algorithms present a counterexample for the common currency view that says that decisions for how to act are based on value.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Why "Value-Free" RL Algorithms Still Rely on a Common Currency of Value</head><p>There are a pair of problems, however, for Hayden and Niv's analysis. First, notice that policy gradient algorithms are designed to acquire an optimal policy. Optimality in the RL framework means that an agent acting on the action weights specified in the policy achieves maximum expected value (relative to the case in which actions are selected on the basis of alternative action weight assignments, up to the limit of ties). So, in the rock/paper/scissors example, the optimal policy that is learned effectively conveys that doing each action 1/3 of the time will maximize expected value. It follows that policy gradient methods clearly do convey information about value: They convey that preforming certain actions, the ones specified in the learned optimal policy, maximizes expected value.</p><p>But there is an additional deeper issue. Earlier it was noted that policy gradient algorithms work by making incremental nudges to action weights These nudges are based on observations of subsequent total rewards over a training episode. But notice that these total reward signals arise from additively summing over individual rewards arising from intrinsic goals that are potentially highly dissimilar (e.g., nourishment and safety). The total reward signal thus combines information about dissimilar outcomes into a common currency.</p><p>Furthermore, these total reward signals are used to determine the appropriate size and direction of the nudges to the action weights during each learning episode. This effectively involves comparison of total reward signals across episodes, such that action weight settings that yield higher total reward during an episode are nudged higher, and actions weight settings that yield lower total reward during an episode are nudged lower. These total reward signals thus convey magnitude-type information about the expected goodness or badness of the current action weight settings, and they allow for comparison of different action weight settings across different episodes, precisely what a common currency of value is supposed to do.</p><p>Importantly, in policy gradient methods, the common currency of value operates during the learning phase, allowing for comparison of action weight settings in terms of value attainment and modification of these settings at each training episode. What is eventually supplied to decision-making systems is an optimal policy, i.e., the action weight settings that maximize expected value (up to the limit of ties). This approach contrasts with the temporal difference algorithm, which supplies magnitude-type value information, thus enabling comparison of value across the options at the time of decision. Both approaches use scalar value to compare options, but they do so at different phases.</p><p>A key advantage of the policy gradient approach is that it obviates the need at the time of decision for comparisons of the scalar value of the options, increasing the speed with which responses can be generated. Thus, policy gradient methods are frequently deployed for problems in which speed is at a premium, such as control of routinized movement. But the fact that magnitude-type information is not compared at the time of decision should not be taken to show that policy gradient methods eschew value altogether.</p><p>A more general conclusion is that while some authors have spoken loosely that some RL algorithms learn value information while other algorithms do not <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, this way of putting things is not exactly correct. All RL algorithms use a common currency of value to make comparisons across the options and guide decisions about how to act. What these authors likely meant is that many RL algorithms, such as the temporal difference algorithm, supply magnitude-type value information for use by decision processes during the decision-phase, but other RL algorithms, such policy gradient algorithms, leverage a common currency of value exclusively in the learning-phase.</p><p>Policy gradient RL algorithms thus do not present a problem for the common currency view. Instead, the situation is somewhat the opposite. It was noted earlier that RL algorithms of various kinds are ubiquitously observed across multiple psychological domains, including attention allocation, habitual action, working memory, and executive control. Furthermore, all RL algorithms use a common currency of value, some in the decision phase and others exclusively in the learning phase. These two observations jointly provide strong evidence for the common currency view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Do Dissimilar Systems Compete in a Common Currency of Value?</head><p>People make decisions that trade off an astonishing diversity of goods, including food, money, safety, social gains, morally-valenced outcomes, and many others. A question arises as to how choices are made involving such highly disparate items.</p><p>The common currency view provides an attractive general answer: Disparate alternatives are compared in a common medium of value, and the alternative with the highest value is selected. But there are two importantly different levels at which a common currency can operate.</p><p>Many of the examples discussed thus far in Parts 2 and 3, including examples drawn from the RL framework, neuroimaging, and sequential sampling computational models such as decision field theory, assume what we can call an options-level common currency. In this approach, value attaches directly to the options themselves, i.e., the goods to be consumed, outcomes to be brought about, actions to be executed, and so forth.</p><p>While value is certainly widely used as an options-level common currency across many domains, there are principled reasons to expect limitations on this approach. There is widespread agreement that there are multiple systems in the human brain that contribute to choice and action guidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. Examples include model-based RL systems, model-free RL systems, actor-critic-type systems, Pavlovian systems, and stimulusresponse learning systems, among others.</p><p>The presence of multiple action guidance systems in the human brain raises the question of what happens if more than one system is concurrently engaged, and they produce divergent outputs. This question becomes especially pressing when the systems utilize very different algorithms, and their outputs are in very different formats.</p><p>Consider an example, similar to one suggested by Hayden and Niv <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, in which there is competition between a model-based system and policy gradient-based system. The model-based system uses a scalar value-based RL algorithm that favors selecting option A, while the policy gradient algorithm uses a gradient-based method to learn an optimal policy, and it favors selecting option B. These systems operate by very different computational principles and supply different kinds of value information at the time of decision. The model-based method supplies magnitude-type expected value information for each option. The policy gradient method, which learns an optimal policy, supplies recommended actions (or probabilistic action combinations) that have maximum expected value. Because of these differences, there does not appear to be a common currency that bridges the systems in which the options can be compared, and the one with the highest value selected.</p><p>Noncomparability of this type presents a potentially serious problem for the common currency view, which is committed to the idea that value serves as a shared medium for comparing dissimilar alternatives.</p><p>One way to address this challenge is to consider two different kinds of valuation, optionslevel and meta-level, which yield two correspondingly different ways of executing a common currency of value. In options-level valuation, which is the type of valuation that we have been considering thus far, value is assigned directly to the bearers of value, for example goods to be consumed, outcomes to be brought about, or actions to be executed, and so forth.</p><p>In meta-level valuation, value is assigned to competing systems, not as direct bearers of value themselves, but rather as recommendation sources. More specifically, the agent assembles information about the expected value of relying on the recommendations of the respective systems, using indicators such as their observed prior accuracy, speed in delivering recommendations, cognitive demands, and so forth. This information is aggregated and the system with overall higher expected value as a recommendation source is selected, and its recommendation is executed. In short, instead of asking a firstorder question of which option is better, the agent asks a second-order question of which system is it better to follow.</p><p>There is considerable evidence for meta-level valuation in human decision-making, which will be reviewed shortly. But a key point, which appears to have been underappreciated, is that this type of valuation allows for an elegant solution for the noncomparability problem.</p><p>Recall the earlier example of competition between a model-based RL system and a policy gradient-based RL system. Because the respective systems operate with different computational principles and supply value information in different formats, an optionslevel common currency was not available. Importantly, however, the presence of this kind of first-order noncomparability only hampers using value to answer the first-order question of which option is better. It is no bar to asking the second-order question of which system is it better to follow. The agent can answer this higher-level question leveraging indicators such as the respective systems' prior accuracy, speed, cognitive demands, etc. In short, even in the absence of a first-order common currency, value can still serve as a higherorder common currency allowing adjudication among competing systems in a common medium of value.</p><p>The preceding solution for the noncomparability problem is not merely theoretical. There is extensive evidence that meta-level valuation is in fact widespread across multiple domains of human cognition.</p><p>A number of researchers investigated competition between model-based and model-free reinforcement learning, identifying a set of factors that tend to promote use of each of the respective systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>. These factors are integrated in a proposed cost/benefit model <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> in which model-based control is favored when its benefits in terms of accuracy outweigh its costs in terms of slower speed and opportunity cost in consuming limited cognitive resources.</p><p>A similar model has been put forward for explaining competition between controlled and automatic processing. In the expected value of control framework from Shenhav, Cohen, and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>, controlled processing is favored by cues indicating higher expected value for exercising control, which include errors on previous trials, surprising outcomes, the presence of response conflict, and incentives for accurate performance.</p><p>Finally, another place where we see meta-level valuation is in the strategy selection phase of heuristic decision-making, which will be discussed at length in the following section.</p><p>In sum, there are at least two different levels at which a common currency can operate, and both are widely used in human decision-making. At the first level, dissimilar options (i.e., entities that are the direct bearers of value) compete in an options-level common currency of value to resolve the question of which option is best. At the second level, dissimilar systems compete in a meta-level common currency of value to resolve the question of which system is it best to follow. In both cases, the same underlying strategy is deployed: a common medium of value is used to resolve competition among dissimilar alternatives.</p></div>

But an agent using heuristics ostensibly seems to be doing something quite different; they do not seem to be calculating value at all.</p><p>Hayden and Niv take up this line of critique <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. They argue that whereas common currency models in the neuroeconomics framework take value to be essential for choice, heuristic approaches solve the problem of how to choose "without the need for computation of values." They add, "Importantly for our argument, the success of heuristic approaches demonstrates that value calculations are not essential for neuroeconomic theories of choice. In particular, heuristic theories can solve many problems for which value is proposed to be needed," including for "comparison of multi-dimensional goods and bundles, and for choice across dissimilar goods."</p><p>Heuristics are indeed widespread in decision-making. What is up for debate, however, is the further claim, captured in the quote from Hayden and Niv, that heuristic decisionmaking represents a problem or threat to the common currency view. A key point that is not addressed in Hayden and Niv's discussion is that heuristics in fact rely on value information at two importantly different places. Once we see how information about value is essential for the operation of heuristics, it becomes clear that the use of heuristics is not incompatible with the common currency view after all.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Value in Heuristic Decision-Making</head><p>One place that value enters into heuristic decision-making is in the application of a heuristic. Suppose a decision-maker selects the take-the-best heuristic for a specific decision problem at hand. Value representations are pivotal to the application of this procedure.</p><p>The take-the-best heuristic requires that the agent must select the most "important" dimension, and, critically, importance is defined in valuational terms. That is, the most important dimension is the one with the highest "predictive validity", i.e., the one that most distinguishes the options in terms of their respective overall expected values. For example, in deciding between a Jeep versus a minivan, for many people, safety emerges as an important dimension while fuel efficiency does not. This is because safety distinguishes the options substantially in terms of value (Jeeps are uniquely prone to rollovers) but fuel efficiency does not (the vehicles get similar mileage).</p><p>The agent in addition assesses how much better one option is compared to the others on this important dimension. This comparison requires assessing pairwise relative value along individual attribute dimensions, which presupposes a common scale on which magnitude-type value information can be represented, i.e., a common currency of value.</p><p>There is a second critical place where value information enters into heuristic decisionmaking: in selecting to use a heuristic (and which one) in the first place. Consider an agent presented with a complex decision problem involving multiple options. They could undertake an exhaustive multiattribute aggregation approach. Or they could take a heuristic approach, and there are a number of importantly different heuristic strategies available. How do agents select among all these available strategies?</p><p>This question has been the focus of decades of research in the judgment and decisionmaking field, and a pair of key observations are well established. First, people use a wide variety of decision-making strategies across different problem contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. For example, sometimes they focus on important dimensions, other times they make a series of pairwise relative value comparisons, and still other times they opt for exhaustive calculation.</p><p>Second, people tend to employ strategies that are well-suited to the specific problem context at hand <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70]</ref>. For example, in "non-compensatory" environments, in which looking at a small set of attributes is sufficient for optimal choice, people tend to employ heuristic strategies that home in on a small set of difference-making attributes. But in "compensatory" environments, in which a large number of attributes must be considered for optimal choice, people switch to strategies that more closely resemble exhaustive multi-attribute aggregation.</p><p>These observations raise a further question: How exactly do people know which strategy to use for which problem context? Building on prior work <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>, Lieder and Griffiths <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> model strategy selection in terms of a value learning problem. They propose that agents learn a predictive model that maps each problem type they encounter into strategies that maximize the value of computation (VOC) for that problem type. VOC in turn reflects a balance between the benefits of using a strategy, assumed to be primarily accuracy, and the costs, assumed to be primarily time spent executing the strategy.</p><p>The agent learns the VOC of available strategies for each problem-type through an RL-type iterative value learning algorithm, and when they encounter a new decision problem, they select the strategy with highest VOC for that problem type. In short, then, the choice to employ a heuristic strategy is itself a value-based decision aimed at jointly maximizing primarily accuracy and speed.</p><p>Overall, then, we can think of the role of value in heuristic decision-making in terms of two different kinds of common currencies operating at different levels. First, the application of a heuristic involves the use of an options-level common currency of value, which enables relative value comparisons of options along a selected set of attribute dimensions, for example the most important dimensions. Second, the selection of a heuristic itself involves a meta-level common currency of value. A range of heuristic decision-making strategies are available, and the agent selects the strategy best suited for the current problem context based on these strategies' respective expected values as recommendation sources. Once a strategy is selected, the agent executes the strategy and chooses the option it recommends.</p><p>It follows that heuristic decision-making does not bypass value after all; it instead richly employs it at two levels. Heuristic decision-making is thus not a problem for the common currency view. Instead, the ubiquity of heuristic decision-making provides further support for the view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Context Effects and Preference Reversals: Can the Common Currency View Accommodate "Irrational" Choice?</head><p>The common currency model says that people select among alternatives on the basis of a common currency of value, selecting the alternative with highest value. Some theorists suggest that models of this type, which are inspired by economic theory, cannot accommodate observations of "irrational" decision-making such as context effects and preference reversals <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76]</ref>.</p><p>For example, consider a decision problem that produces the so-called "similarity effect" <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>. Suppose job candidate A is strong on personality and weak on work ethic while B is the reverse, and people generally prefer each roughly equally. Adding a third job candidate S that is very similar to A to the option set (slightly better than A on personality, slightly worse than A on work ethic) tends to substantially decrease the proportion of choices for A <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>.</p><p>Some theorists contend that that the similarity effect and other preference reversals are a problem for models that posit a common currency of value. For example, Walsek and Brown <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> argue that, "Context-induced changes in attribute weightings are … hard to understand if there is a single common currency of value-because the existence of such a currency mandates a fixed trade-off between attribute values." They add, "Such inconsistencies are typically taken as problematic, because utility functions cannot be easily constructed to accommodate systematic preference reversals."</p><p>Walsek and Brown's critique, and related critiques by other theorists <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, appear to be actually directed at different target. Their target appears to be representational common currency models such as standard expected utility (EU) models of the kind associated with John von Neumann &amp; Oskar Morgenstern <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref> and Leonard Savage <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, among others. But the common currency model at work in neuroeconomics and other areas of cognitive science, and which is the focus of this essay, is a mechanistic common currency model. Standard EU theory treats value as a means to represent patterns of preferences over options. That is, the theory starts with an agent who is observed to display a certain pattern of preferences over pairwise options and, if these preferences satisfy a set of consistency conditions specified in the axioms of the theory, then a utility function is next constructed to represent this overall preference structure. Context effects are a decisive problem for standard EU theory because inconsistent preference patterns violate these axiomatic consistency conditions. Such preferences cannot be represented by a single utility function, just as the critics allege.</p><p>But the common currency model used in neuroeconomics and other areas of cognitive science is not representational, it is mechanistic. In a mechanistic common currency model, the agent must assemble information about the options in order to locate the options on a single dimension of value. This value dimension serves as mechanism by which by which the goodness or badness of the options can be tabulated and compared.</p><p>Critically, the information assembly process utilized to locate the options on this dimension is multi-step, unfolds over time, and relies on multiple interacting factors such as attention, memory retrieval, pairwise comparisons, noisy evidence accumulation, probability estimation, and so forth. Notably, all of these factors can influence the ongoing assembly of information in context sensitive ways, which in turn can influence subsequent choices and produce context effects.</p><p>Multi-attribute decision field theory (MDFT) provides a computationally precise illustration of this phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. These points, however, are quite general and apply generally to other sequential sampling-type models <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref> as well as other models of complex decision-making such as heuristic decision-making (see Part 4). In the MDFT model, the agent focuses, via a stochastic attention process, on one of the attributes of the options and compares each pair of options along this attribute dimension. In the job candidate example discussed earlier, if the attribute currently in focus were work ethic, B would strongly beat A and S, while if the attribute in focus were personality, A and S would strongly beat B. As attention moves from attribute to attribute, value information arising from these pairwise comparisons accumulates for each option over time under conditions of noise. When a prespecified confidence threshold is reached, the agent selects the associated option.</p><p>Importantly, the MDFT model provides a natural explanation for the similarity effect in terms of division of attentional advantages <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. When attention focuses more on the work ethic dimension, B uniquely gains an advantage, but when attention focuses more on the personality dimension, both A and S gain an advantage, and once we add noise into the picture, the "wins" are roughly split between them. Thus, the addition of S to the option set tends to leave the proportion of choices of B unchanged while choices for A are roughly halved-precisely the contextual effect that is observed in experimental settings.</p><p>For our purposes, the key point is that models like MDFT explain how context effects arise in terms of the assembly of information in order to locate options on a mechanistic common currency of value. The information assembly process often relies on factors such as stochastic attention, pairwise value comparisons, noisy evidence accumulation, etc., which are susceptible to contextual influences and can thus produce context effects and preference reversals.</p><p>Overall, then, context effects are after all compatible with the common currency view, as long as the view is understood in mechanistic, not representational, terms. Indeed, the evidence relations are somewhat the reverse: Models such as MDFT that rely on a mechanistic common currency of value provide detailed explanations for how context effects and preference reversals arise, and thus observing these effects provides support for the mechanistic common currency view.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The common currency view is a core thesis in neuroeconomics and other areas of cognitive science; it is supported by behavioral, chronometric, computational, and neural methods; and it has found application across diverse domains of cognition.</p><p>In this essay, the common currency view was defended from several influential criticisms. The essence of the response was that the criticisms are focused on a relatively simple kind of common currency model in which the agent always calculates the scalar value of their options at the time of decision-a model that admittedly encounters significant problems. Over the course of this essay, a more sophisticated understanding of the common currency model was elaborated and defended. This revised view identifies different ways in which a common currency of value can be implemented in terms of two phases (decisionphase and learning-phase) and two levels (options-level and meta-level). It also distinguishes mechanistic common currency models utilized in cognitive science and representational common currency models utilized in standard EU theory. This more nuanced common currency view is more powerful and psychologically realistic, and it addresses the criticisms that have been directed at the model. A final point is that the arguments of this essay underscore the generality of common currency view as a general model of selection among options-this view applies very broadly across a vast array settings and domains.</p><p>For example, the common currency view applies to choices in which value information is supplied by diverse kinds of RL algorithms, including policy gradient algorithms which are sometimes described as "value free," and there is strong evidence that different kinds of RL algorithms are operative across multiple psychological domains. The common currency view applies to cases in which disparate options are directly traded off. But it also applies to more complex situations in which dissimilar systems compete-such competition is also resolved in a common currency of meta-level value. Furthermore, the common currency view applies to various kinds of deliberative decision-making, which includes exhaustive multiattribute aggregation, but also includes various kinds of heuristic decision-making strategies. Finally, the common currency model extends to "irrational" choices involving contextual effects and preference reversals.</p><p>Overall, the more nuanced common currency view put forward and defended in this essay has grand aspirations to be a truly general approach to understanding human decisionmaking across diverse psychological domains.</p></div>		</body>
