			<abstract>
				<p>Social information pervades human life, influencing behavior for the better (e.g., adopting valuable ideas) or worse (e.g., spreading false news). Both on-and offline, people routinely interact in groups harboring disparate opinions, views and behaviors. However, we still know little about the strategies people use to integrate disparate social information. Combining experimental and cognitive modelling approaches, we show that the impact of social information strongly depends on its distribution: agreement among peers increases people&apos;s tendency to follow them, and peers confirming one&apos;s initial beliefs leads people to ignore others who disagree. Our results contribute to understanding the nature of individuals&apos; social information use, and delineate when groups can build consensus or are bound for deepening polarization.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>The way in which individuals integrate personal and social information shapes a wide range of collective phenomena, including the spread of knowledge across social networks (1), the development of financial markets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>, political mobilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> and voting outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. By interacting with others and observing their behavior, individuals can often glean useful information helping them to, for example, rapidly adjust to new environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. However, with more and more of these interactions occurring online, and being controlled by algorithms that prioritize interactions between like-minded people <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, people can become cut off from information that might challenge their beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>. It has been argued that such dynamics may lead to stronger in-group consensus, and between-group polarization, in controversial matters ranging from same-sex marriage and vaccine safety to climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. To counteract these dynamics, several recent projects (e.g., onesub.io and nuzzera.com) have focused on de-biasing news feeds and provide users with more balanced social information from disparate sources (for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>). Yet, to effectively de-bias individuals we need a detailed understanding of the strategies individuals use when they are confronted with disparate social information coming from multiple sources.</p><p>Social information use is extensively studied across the biological and social sciences <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. In humans, social information use often involves changing one's mind after observing the behavior of other people <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. This process is commonly investigated using estimation tasks in which people are allowed to revise their first estimates after observing the estimate of a peer (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>).</p><p>Studies using this approach give a detailed and quantified account of the effects of social cues on behavior, primarily focusing on how individuals incorporate a single piece of social information <ref type="bibr">(29-31, 33, 36, 37)</ref>. Studies considering multiple peers have mainly described the effect of the central tendency (e.g., the mean social information; <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>, but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>). In most real-world environments, however, people are confronted with multiple sources of social information at the same time, in various degrees of extremity. Currently, it is unclear how people integrate such disparate social information. Here we will address this issue in three steps.</p><p>First, we experimentally investigate how basic characteristics of the distribution of social information shape social information use. Specifically, we systematically manipulate the variance (reflecting the agreement among peers) and skewness (reflecting the clustering of peers close to or far away from the focal participant) of the distribution, while holding its mean constant. We show that the impact of social information strongly depends on its distribution. Disagreement among peers decreases their overall influence. Furthermore, the direction of the skew substantially alters the impact of social information: participants adjust their first estimate considerably more when the majority of peers moderately agree with them and one peer strongly disagrees, compared to a situation in which a single peer strongly agrees with them, but the majority of peers strongly disagrees. This highlights the strong influence of confirmation effects.</p><p>Second, we introduce a formal model to explain the strategies underlying these adjustments. This model is informed by previous research on individuals' strategies for incorporating a single piece of social information. This research has identified three distinct strategies: (i) keeping one's initial beliefs, (ii) adopting the behavior of others, or (iii) 'compromising' between personal and social information <ref type="bibr">(24, 30-32, 35, 42-48)</ref>. We develop a modeling framework that extends these insights to situations with multiple social sources, accommodating both simple heuristics (keeping and adopting), and more complex strategies (compromising). Our model successfully recovers the main patterns in the observed data: it accurately predicts how the distribution of social information impacts the relative frequencies of adjustment strategies, and accounts for the strong between-individual heterogeneity in strategy use. Our modelling results reveal that social information receives more weight when it is in line with people's initial beliefs (reflecting confirmation effects), and when it is in close agreement with other social information (reflecting peer consensus).</p><p>Finally, we use our model to go beyond mere description, and use it to predict how identified adjustment strategies may shape belief dynamics in exemplary social environments that vary in the like-mindedness of peers. These simulations reveal how and when people's prioritizing of confirmatory social information can exacerbate filter bubble effects. Moreover, they illustrate how individual differences in confirmation effects can render beliefs to become more moderate (fostering group consensus) or more extreme (fueling group polarization).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Design</head><p>To examine how people integrate disparate information from multiple social sources, we used an adapted version of the BEAST (Berlin Estimate AdjuStment Task): a validated perceptual judgment task known to reliably measure individuals' social information use ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1 (37)</ref>). In the task, participants are repeatedly shown images of animal groups and have to estimate the number of animals ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1A,B</ref>).</p><p>They then observe the estimates of three previous participants, and make a second estimate <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1C)</ref>.</p><p>The relative degree of adjustment quantifies an individual's social information use <ref type="figure">(Fig 1D (37)</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 1. Experimental paradigm and the impact of disparate social information. (A)</head><p>Participants start with observing a group of animals for six seconds. (B) Next, they enter their first estimate of the total number of animals using a slider. (C) Then, they observe the estimates of three prerecorded peers (red squares), as well as their first estimate (light blue oval), and enter their second estimate (dark blue oval). (D) Social information use in a round (s) is calculated as the adjustment from the first estimate (E1) to the second estimate (E2), divided by the distance between the first estimate and the mean of the social information ( ̅ ). Rearranging the terms highlights that E2 is an average of E1 and ̅ , weighted by s:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E2 = (1−s) • E1 + s • ̅ . (E)</formula><p>Across four conditions, we manipulated the distribution of social information (squares) relative to a participant's first estimate (oval). Across conditions, we manipulated the variance and skewness of the social information, while fixing the distance between the mean of the social information and the participant's first estimate (for details see Experimental Design). Peer estimates displayed either low variance (LN) or high variance but no skewness (HN), or high variance with a skewed distribution, with a cluster of two peers far from (HF), or close to (HC) E1. (F) Mean estimate shifts in each condition. Colored dots show participants' mean adjustments across the five rounds of each condition; ̅ =1 indicates a mean estimate shift to ̅ . Boxplots show the interquartile range (IQR), the median (black line), and the 1.5 IQR (whiskers). Red vertical lines show for each condition the predicted medians of the best-fitting model (see Cognitive Model). For strategies underlying mean estimate shifts across rounds, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2</ref>.</p><p>We study participants' social information use across four conditions that systematically differ in variance and skewness, while controlling for the mean deviation from a participant's first estimate ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1E</ref>): (i) low variance, not skewed (LN); (ii) high variance, not skewed (HN); (iii) high variance, with a cluster of two peers relatively far from the participant's first estimate (HF); (iv) high variance, with a cluster of two peers relatively close to a participant's first estimate (HC). These conditions encompass a broad range of distributions individuals may encounter when sampling their social environment.</p><p>Across all conditions, the three pieces of social information always point in the same-and correctdirection (i.e., avoiding situations in which the social information brackets the personal estimate).</p><p>Importantly, holding constant the relative mean deviation from a participant's first estimate across conditions implies that a participant weighting all peer estimates equally should make similar adjustments across all conditions.</p><p>Ninety-five participants completed thirty rounds of the judgment task. Each participant completed five rounds of each condition, presented in randomized order and interleaved with 10 'filler' rounds.</p><p>Social information in the 'filler' rounds consisted of the estimates of three randomly drawn previous participants, ensuring that across all rounds, social information was sometimes higher and sometimes lower than a participant's first estimate, and sometimes bracketed the participant's personal estimate (see Methods for details). As a control, participants completed five additional rounds in which they did not observe the stimulus themselves, but only the estimates of four peers. The distribution of these peer estimates emulated the distributions of the four experimental conditions (i.e., one of each condition), plus a filler round. This enables us to compare how participants integrate personal and social information with this control condition, which reveals how participants aggregate a distribution of estimates in the absence of an own prior estimate <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50)</ref>. Participants were recruited and performed the task online (see Methods).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Experimental results. Participants' use of social information strongly depended on its distribution ( <ref type="figure">Fig.   1F</ref>). Participants adjusted their estimates most when social information had low variance and no skewness (LN condition; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1F, yellow)</ref>, shifting, on average, 41.5% towards the mean social information. In the high variance and no skew condition (HN condition; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1F</ref>, purple), average adjustments were credibly lower (mean adjustment: 29.0%; see <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> for statistics). Although adjustments in both conditions with skewed distributions were credibly lower than in the LN condition, the direction of the skew affected the relative adjustment: participants adjusted credibly more when two peers clustered relatively close by (HC condition; mean: 36.5%; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1F</ref>, red) rather than far from the participant (HF condition; mean: 27.9%; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1F</ref>, green). Overall, these results demonstrate that variance and skewness in peer behavior markedly affect social information use.</p><p>These results also show that average adjustments tended to be much smaller than what would be expected when participants weigh each of the three peer estimates as much as their own personal estimate (in which case they would adjust to the arithmetic mean of the four estimates, shifting 75% towards the mean social information in each condition). Moreover, participants substantially varied in their average adjustments, and these average adjustments strongly correlated across conditions (all pairwise Pearson correlations r≥0.76, P&lt;0.001; <ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>), indicating consistent inter-individual differences in social information use (see also below). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref> zooms in on the strategies underlying behavioral adjustments across rounds, differentiating between three distinct strategies: (1) keeping the first estimate, (2) adopting the estimate of one of the three peers, or (3) compromising between the first estimate and the peer estimates. The relative frequency of these strategies differed markedly between the four conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2A-D</ref>; see <ref type="table">Table S2</ref> for statistics). When participants observed a single peer that closely agreed with them (HN and HF conditions; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2B</ref>,C), participants were more likely to either keep their first estimate, or to adopt the estimate of this near peer. When none of the peers was in close agreement with them (LN and HC conditions; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2A</ref>,D), participants were more likely to compromise, adjusting their estimate towards -but rarely beyond -the nearest peer. These results demonstrate that variance and skewness in peer behavior have strong effects on the strategies people use to integrate disparate social information. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2E</ref> shows the frequency of strategies per participant across all conditions, illustrating that participants ranged from almost exclusively compromising, to exclusively keeping (see also <ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>), with compromising being the most frequent strategy. In all four control conditions -in which participants did not observe the stimulus, but four peer estimates, emulating the four distributions of the experimental conditions -responses were close to the arithmetic mean of the four peer estimates (Figs. S2 &amp; S3). Participants did, however, assign more weight to estimates closer to each other <ref type="figure">(Fig. S4</ref>). This indicates that the observed deviations from the arithmetic mean in the experimental conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1F &amp; Fig. 2A</ref>-D) are not due to an inability to integrate multiple pieces of information. Rather, the stark differences between the experimental and control conditions show that people down-weight social information that is more distant from their own first estimate, an effect known as 'egocentric discounting' <ref type="bibr">(31, 32, 34-36, 41, 44-46, 51)</ref>. and more complex strategies (compromising; <ref type="figure">Fig. 3A</ref>). Based on our behavioral findings and previous literature, we assume that an individual's relative probabilities of using any adjustment strategy (keep, adopt or compromise) depends on the distance between their own first estimate and the estimate of the nearest peer <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51)</ref>. We further assume that, when compromising, the weight of each of the peer estimates depends on its distance to an individual's own first estimate <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>, and its distance to other peer estimates (capturing a possible 'proximity effect'; <ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51)</ref>). These assumptions are reflected in four model features, defining the selection of (i) the keep heuristic, or (ii) the adopt heuristic, and, when compromising, the weighting of social information based on (iii) confirmation or (iv) proximity. We formalize these features below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 3. Cognitive model of the integration of disparate social information. (A)</head><p>We model participants' estimate adjustments by combining heuristics of keeping and adopting with compromising strategies. We model the probability of keeping the first estimate (green arrow) as a function of the distance between a participants first estimate (E1; blue oval) and the nearest peer (X1). Similarly, the probability of adopting the nearest peer estimate (brown arrow) is a function of its distance to E1. Compromising entails taking a weighted average of E1 and the peer estimates (Xi; red squares): we predict a participant's second estimate (E2; transparent blue) based on Bayesian updating using weighted means of E1 and each Xi. Personal and social information are represented as probability density distributions with means at the observed estimates, and variances inversely related to their weight. Relative weights of social information depend on their distance to E1 (i.e., degree of agreement with the participant; 'confirmation') and mean distance to other social information (i.e., degree of agreement with others; 'proximity'). (B) Improvement of fit for each of the model features based on looic differences (Methods). Dots show fit improvements for pairs of models excluding and including each feature, and the box plots show the median improvement and IQR. (C-E) The effect of each feature included in the best-fitting model. (C) Fitted probability of keeping one's first estimate as a function of its distance to the nearest peer. (D and E) Variance assigned to peer estimates as a function of their distance to E1 (D), and as their mean distance to other peers (E). Thin lines represent estimates for individuals and thick lines show group-level means.</p><p>We cast these assumptions into a Bayesian mixture model. First, individuals choose one of the three strategies with respective probabilities P(keep), P(adopt), and P(compromise) based on logistic functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>. Formally, we define the probability to keep as P(keep) = ( + • 1 ), where and determine the intercept and slope of the standard logistic function (S), and 1 is the absolute distance between the first estimate and the nearest peer estimate:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1 = | 1 − 1 |. Likewise,</formula><p>we define the probability to adopt the estimate of the nearest peer as P(adopt) = ( +</p><p>• 1 ). Note that we do not include the possibility to adopt the estimates of the peers that were not the nearest, as this rarely happened in our data ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2)</ref> and would make the model overly complicated.</p><p>The probability to compromise is given by: 1 -P(keep) -P(adopt). Subsequently, compromising is modelled as a Bayesian updating process <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54)</ref>: individuals weigh their first estimate (E1) and the peer estimates (X1-3) and generate an updated (posterior) belief <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3A)</ref>. We assume that an individual's initial (prior) belief about the number of animals (N) follows a discretized normal distribution centered around the first estimate E1. The uncertainty of the initial belief is captured in the variance of the distribution ( 2 ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( | ) ∼ ( 1 , 2 ).</formula><p>Likewise, we model social information ( ) as discretized normal distributions around peer estimates ( ), with uncertainty 2 :</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( | ) ∼ ( , 2 )</formula><p>, where the subscript s indexes each peer estimate. Both 2 and 2 are free parameters indicating how much weight individuals assign to the estimates, with high values (i.e., more uncertainty) indicating less weight. When 2 &lt; 2 , participants assign more weight to their personal first estimate than to those of others.</p><p>Individuals further weigh each peer estimate based on the extent to which it confirms their own prior belief, and its proximity to the other two peer estimates. Confirmation-based weighting depends on the absolute distance between a peer estimate and an individual's first estimate (</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= | 1 − |).</formula><p>Formally, this distance impacts the uncertainty assigned to the estimate: We fit a series of models to simultaneously estimate the parameter values defining relative probabilities of using any adjustment strategies (keeping, adopting, or compromising), and confirmation-and and proximity-based weighting. To account for individual differences in strategy use ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2E</ref>), we implement hierarchical Bayesian models (see Methods for implementation details). We evaluate the importance of the four model features 'keep', 'adopt', 'confirmation', and 'proximity' by calculating the leave-one-out cross-validation (looic (55)) of the 16 models comprising all possible combinations of these features <ref type="table">(Table S3</ref>). Parameter recovery confirmed that our model fitting procedure yields robust and interpretable parameter values ( <ref type="figure">Fig. S8</ref>; Supplementary Methods). <ref type="figure">Figure 3B</ref> compares the fits of models including versus excluding each feature. It reveals that all but one considered feature reliably improve the model fit, with only 'adopt' marginally reducing predictive accuracy. Correspondingly, the best-fitting model includes the keep heuristic, and compromising based on both 'confirmation' and 'proximity' <ref type="table">(Table S3</ref>). The parameter estimates from the best-fitting model are presented in <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>, and the effects of its three features are illustrated in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3C</ref>-E.</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">2 = + • ,</formula><p>Overall, participants were more likely to apply a heuristic of 'keeping' when the nearest peer was in close agreement with them. Many participants frequently kept their first estimate when they observed a peer in close agreement with them, and this likelihood sharply dropped with increasing distance to the nearest peer ( &lt; 0; <ref type="figure">Fig. 3C</ref>).</p><p>When compromising, participants tended to weigh personal information more than social information ( 2 &lt; 2 ; <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>). Importantly, participants assigned more weight to peers who more strongly agreed with them ( &gt; 0; <ref type="figure">Fig. 3D</ref>). This result is indicative of a confirmation effect (i.e., favoring information that affirms one's beliefs). Furthermore, participants assigned more weight to peers who showed more agreement with other peers ( &gt; 0; <ref type="figure">Fig. 3E</ref>). This proximity effect was, however, much smaller than the effect of 'confirmation' ( &lt; ; compare slopes in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3D</ref> vs E). For each of the features, the model detects substantial individual differences (indicated by the thin lines in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3C</ref>-E), thus capturing the high inter-individual differences in mean adjustment and strategy use (Figs. 2F, S1 and S5). Finally, we note that the absence of an effect of adopting the nearest peer estimate <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3B</ref>) may be because instances of adopting can be accounted for by adjustment through compromising.</p><p>Importantly, the best-fitting model closely predicts the mean adjustment across conditions ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1F</ref>; red vertical lines) as well as the distributions of adjustments in rounds across conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2A-D;</ref> red diamonds). This shows that the model can account for the main patterns observed in our experimental conditions. Our model also accurately predicts participants' mean adjustment and keep probability in the 'filler' rounds (where peer estimates were randomly selected from the prerecorded pool and frequently bracketed the participant's first estimate; <ref type="figure">Fig. S5</ref>). Furthermore, the model can recover a commonly-observed phenomenon in estimation tasks, namely that mean adjustments are highest when social information is at intermediate distance from first estimates ( <ref type="figure">Fig. S6 (34, 35)</ref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that our model can generalize to cases that are qualitatively different from our experimental conditions (on which the model was trained).</p><p>Simulations. The identified strategies of social information use allow us to predict how they may shape belief shifts in settings where individuals encounter peers with various levels of like-mindedness. In the following, we use simulations to explore how the social environment and social information use may foster consensus, or, alternatively, lead to polarization. We simulate agents who, as in the experiment, observe other estimates and adjust their first estimate. Agents observe ten pieces of social information, across five qualitative different exemplary settings. We start with three settings in which an agent's first estimate is confirmed by either a (i) large majority, (ii) half of the peers, or (iii) only a small minority. We further simulate settings in which the focal agent is leaning towards one of two strongly disagreeing groups, and compare adjustment of agents with (iv) strong or (v) weak confirmation effect. In each setting, we simulate 1,000 agents whose adjustment strategies (i.e., their parameter setting) were sampled from the group-level distributions parameterized by the mean posterior estimates of the best-fitting model (see Methods for details). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> shows the predicted adjustments for the five scenarios. (i) When agents predominantly observe social information that agrees with their prior beliefs (i.e., mirroring a 'filter bubble' (7, 56)), they predominantly keep their first estimate or, at most, make a very small adjustment ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 4A</ref>). (ii)</p><p>Even when only half of the peers agree with them-and the other half strongly disagrees (reflecting a scenario typical for a de-biasing attempt (12))-agents only shift little, remaining far away from the global mean estimate <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4B</ref>). This suggests that even regular exposure to opposing information (e.g., from outside one's filter bubble) is unlikely to lead to substantial adjustments. (iii) Even when only a small minority agrees with them, agents are still prone to keep their first estimate, although adjustments towards the majority become more substantial <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4C</ref>). Overall, these simulation results illustrate how confirmation effects can curb belief updating: confirmatory social information reinforces people's prior beliefs and prompts them to retain these beliefs, even if they reflect minority views.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 4. Simulated adjustments of agents observing ten pieces of social information in varying compositions.</head><p>In the simulations, peer estimates were always Low or High (vertical black lines; see Methods for details). Numbers in the red boxes correspond to the number of peers in each category. In (A-C) The agent's first estimate is also Low. Agents likely keep their first estimate when they observe (A) a large majority agreeing with them, (B) half of the peers agreeing with them, and (C) only a small minority agreeing with them, though in the latter case agents shifted substantially more. In (D-E), peers are equally split, and the agent's first estimate is in between the two clusters of peers, but closer to one cluster than the other. (D) Agents with a strong confirmation effect (sampled from the upper 50% of the distribution; cf. steepest slopes in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3D</ref>) tend to adjust towards the local extreme estimate. (E) Agents showing a weak confirmation effect (lower 50% of the distribution) tend to adjust towards the global mean estimate. In all panels, vertical bars show distributions of predicted adjustments across 1,000 simulations. The horizontal boxplots summarize these distributions, showing the median, IQR and and the 1.5 IQR (whiskers).</p><p>To further examine the possible implications of individual differences in confirmation effects, we simulated adjustments for agents with high and low levels of this effect (i.e., individuals with steep and shallow slopes in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3D</ref>). Agents were initially located in between two clusters of peers, but slightly closer to one of the clusters. In this setting, agents with strong confirmation effects tend to adjust towards the local cluster-moving away from the global mean <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4D</ref>). Weak confirmation effects tend to lead to adjustments towards the global mean estimate <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4E)</ref>. These results suggest that strong confirmation effects can drive people to more extreme views, and may increase polarization over time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Social information is increasingly consumed online, and often being controlled by algorithms that prioritize like-minded sources over others <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8)</ref>. It has been argued that this prioritization contributes to increased polarization <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. A prominent approach to counteract polarization and promote consensus is to provide users with more balanced social information from disparate sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>.</p><p>Although interventions like this have a strong intuitive appeal, it is hitherto largely unknown how people integrate information from multiple social sources that (dis)agree with oneself and each other. Overall, people assigned more weight to their personal initial beliefs than to social information <ref type="figure">(Fig.   1F</ref>, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2A</ref>-D; <ref type="figure">Fig. S3; Fig. S4</ref>; <ref type="table">Table S4</ref>). It may seem somewhat puzzling why they would do so in a task in which social information consists of judgments of people incentivised to accurately solve the same problem. Indeed, there is no reason to assume that one's first estimate would be more accurate than those of others. One reason to prioritize personal estimates is the lack of access to others' reasons for holding their beliefs, which may lead participants to discount social information, especially when it is very distinct from one's personal beliefs (36, 57) (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>). Interestingly, while consistent social information is weighted more when people compromise ('confirmation-based weighting'; <ref type="figure">Fig. 3D</ref>), it also increases the chance that people simply keep their initial beliefs <ref type="figure">(Fig. 3C)</ref>. The combined result of these effects is that social information tends to have the strongest impact on overall adjustments when it is at intermediate distance <ref type="figure">(Fig. S6</ref>). Our results reveal that people also weight social information based on its consistency with other social information ('proximity-based weighting'; <ref type="figure">Fig.   3E</ref>; <ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref>). One rationale for prioritizing social information consistent with other social information is relatively straightforward: when people are motivated and able to make valid judgments, agreement among peers reliably signals accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58)</ref>. The concerted action of the three mechanisms (heuristics of keeping, and compromising based on confirmation and peer proximity) explain our experimental observations that the impact of social information strongly depends on the variance and skewness of its distribution. Our model's accurate predictions of behavior in the 'filler' rounds underscores its ability to go beyond mere redescription of the empirical data, and suggests that our model can be generalized to settings that are qualitatively different from our experimental conditions ( <ref type="figure">Fig. S5; Fig. S6</ref>). Our simulations go beyond the limited set of distributions of social information studied in our experiments, generating predictions about how distributions resembling important real-world settings (e.g. filter bubbles)</p><p>shape social information use. These simulations predict that disparate social information changes people's minds only to a limited degree, even when this social information signals that people hold minority views <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4</ref>). More importantly, under certain conditions, observing balanced social information can even lead individuals to take more extreme views <ref type="figure">(Fig. 4D,E</ref>  <ref type="figure">S1</ref>.</p><p>To study the effects of disparate social information on behavior, we used four experimental conditions <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1E)</ref>. Across conditions, we systematically manipulated the variance and skewness of the distributions of social information, while keeping the distance between the mean social information ( ̅ ) and E1 constant. To achieve experimental control without deception, we first recorded a large (N=100) pool of estimates made by MTurkers for each image shown in the main experiment. In a given trial, the three pieces of social information were selected based on the participant's first estimate and the experimental condition assigned to that trial (for implementation details, see <ref type="figure">Supplementary   Methods</ref>). This procedure resulted in clearly defined experimental conditions <ref type="figure">(Fig. S7)</ref>. We randomly shuffled the order of experimental conditions across rounds and held this order fixed for all participants.  <ref type="table">(Table S3)</ref>. We quantified the importance of a feature by calculating the average reduction of the looic when the feature was included rather than excluded <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2B</ref>). In the main text (e.g. <ref type="figure">Fig. 3C</ref>-E) we focus on the results of the best-fitting model, i.e., the model with the lowest looic (see <ref type="table">Table S3</ref>; Supplementary Methods).</p><p>We generated the predictions of the best-fitting model (red lines and diamonds in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1F and Fig. 2,   respectively</ref>) by calculating the probability density function for each participant in each round. This density function was based on the mean posterior parameter estimates for the participant (see <ref type="table">Table   S4</ref> for characteristics of the parameter group-level distributions), their experimentally observed first estimate (E1) and the displayed social information ( ) in that round. To account for stochasticity, the model predictions in <ref type="figure">Figure 1F</ref>   <ref type="figure">(Fig. S5)</ref>. To verify that the model parameters are distinguishable and identifiable, we conducted extensive parameter recovery analyses <ref type="figure">(Fig. S8)</ref>. The results (reported in detail in the Supplementary Methods) confirm that the model allows for reliably recovering all of its parameters.</p><p>Simulations. In each of the settings shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>, agents were endowed with adjustment strategies</p><p>whose parameter values were sampled from the group-level distributions from the best-fitting model <ref type="table">(Table S4)</ref>, assuming no correlations between the parameters. Inspection of the joint posterior distributions of means shows that this assumption is generally justified (for details, see <ref type="table">Table S5</ref>; <ref type="figure">Fig.   S9</ref>; sampling from the individual-level parameters from our experiment does not lead to observable differences in simulation outcomes shown in <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref>). For each agent, we assumed their first estimate to be 50, and simulated their adjustment given the social information in the respective social environment. <ref type="figure">For Fig. 4</ref>, the social environment consisted of ten pieces of social information, either agreeing (i.e., an estimate of 50) or disagreeing (i.e., an estimate of 65) with the focal agent. For <ref type="figure">Fig.   4D</ref> and 4E we sampled the parameters for confirmation-based weighting from the higher and lower half of the group-level distribution of , respectively. The individuals' first estimate in these settings was 55 (that is, in between the two clusters of estimates, but closer to the lower cluster). </p></div>

Adjustments in control conditions in which participants did not observe the stimulus, but only observed four peer estimates. Trials were created by first drawing one estimate (E1') at random from a pool of prerecorded estimates. Then, three additional prerecorded estimates were drawn analogous to the four experimental conditions (see Methods). Before plotting, data was normalized in the same way as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2A</ref>-D, taking E1' as the reference point. Histograms show distributions of estimates in the same colour coding as <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 2A</ref>-D.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. S3.</head><p>Both in experimental (i.e., with observing the stimulus; colored dots and boxplots) and control (i.e., without stimulus; grey dots and boxplots) conditions, participants systematically deviated from an 'ideal Bayesian observer', who would weigh all estimates equally. Boxplots and dots show the absolute difference between participants' second estimates and the arithmetic mean of all four estimates (see Methods more details). Participants deviated more from the arithmetic mean in the experimental conditions compared to the control conditions. <ref type="figure">Fig. S4</ref>. Proximity-based weighting can account for responses (E2') in the control rounds in which participants did not observe the stimulus. The blue line shows the mean absolute difference between per-round predictions and observed responses as a function of parameter β (capturing 'proximity weighting' as the extent of discounting of social information that is inconsistent with other social information). This model assumes that each response is an average of the pieces of social information (Xi), weighted according to their summed distance (d) to other pieces of social information. Formally, predicted responses are calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">2 ′ = ∑ • 4 =1</formula><p>. In this formula, the weighting of each piece of social information (wi) is determined by discount factor β:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">= − ∑ − 4 =1</formula><p>, where =</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∑ | − | 4 =1</formula><p>. When β &gt; 0, more weight is assigned to social information when it is closer to other social information. We observe that the model predictions match the observed responses best when β ≈ 1.3. We interpret this as evidence of proximity-based weighting: on average, participants tend to assign more weight to social information when it is closer to other social information.</p></div>

Also for these out-of-sample predictions, the model quite closely tracks the empirical data. As for previous predictions we sampled 10 estimates for each participant and trial.

Social information tends to have the strongest impact when at intermediate distance.</p><p>We simulated trials that systematically varied the distance between individuals' own first estimates and the mean social information ( = | ̅ − 1 | / 1 ). Dots show predicted mean adjustments as a function of the mean distance to three pieces of social information, for three levels of 'peer proximity', with peer estimates at 0, 3 or 6 numbers away from each other (respectively reflecting 'low', 'medium' or 'high' variance). We observe that mean shifts for each level are highest when the distance of social information is intermediate. This shows that our model is able to recover key results from previous studies showing this nonlinear effect of the distance of social information <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>. When the distance to mean social information is very low, individuals are very likely to keep their first estimates. When the distance to mean social information is very high, individuals are likely to compromise, but assign little weight to social information, again leading to reduced average adjustments. At intermediate distance, social information has the strongest impact: in those cases, the likelihood that individuals keep their first estimates is very close to zero, but when compromising, they still assign positive weight to social information. These effects hold across various levels of peer proximity. As expected, lower variance in social information leads to larger mean adjustments. Note that simulations with peers farther away from each other (i.e. 'high') start at higher values of Δ to avoid that the social information brackets the own first estimate. Including these 'bracketed' cases would show nonlinear adjustment patterns, because near Δ=0 the distance to the nearest peer is a nonlinear function of Δ.</p></div>

Social information was based on data from a prerecorded pool of 100 MTurkers who completed the task without social information.

The graph shows for each condition where the peers were located in the actual experiment, expressed as their absolute deviation from E1, divided by E1.

The diagonal line indicates the position expected under perfect parameter recovery. For the majority of recovered parameter estimates, the generating (input) parameters lie within the 95% CI. This indicates that the model parameters are identifiable. The parameter estimates for ′ and ′ are lower than the generating parameter values.

Participants faced four experimental conditions in which they could adjust their first estimates based on three pieces of social information. These conditions varied in the variance and skewness of the social information <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1E, main text)</ref>. For each round, for each possible first estimate (E1) we considered each possible triple of unique prerecorded estimates, and calculated the first three moments of its distribution (mean μ, variance σ 2 and skewness γ). To determine which triple would be shown in a given condition in a given round for a given value of E1,</p><p>we used a cost function that assigned penalties (L) to deviations from the target mean (Tμ), target variance </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">100 • | μ -Tμ | + 10 • | σ 2 -Tσ 2 | + 1,000 • γ'</formula><p>In all conditions, Tμ was set to deviate 20% from E1.

For the LN and HN we aimed for symmetric distributions so we penalized positive absolute values of γ. For HF and HC, target skewness depended on whether E1 was higher or lower than A. To this end, we used γ' which was equal to γ if E1&gt;A and equal to -γ if E1&lt;A. This procedure ensured that participants faced well-defined experimental conditions <ref type="figure">(Fig. S7</ref>). For the 10 'filler' rounds, which were intermixed with the experimental rounds, we randomly drew social information from the prerecorded pool.</p><p>We further implemented two control conditions completed in separate blocks of the experimental session (these blocks were completed in randomized order). First, participants completed trials in which they did not observe the stimulus themselves, but only observed the estimates of four peers <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. S2)</ref>. For 'keep' and 'adopt', we assume that these two strategies are chosen with mixture probabilities P(keep) and P(adopt). Compromising is chosen with the complementary probability 1 -P(keep) -P(adopt).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implementation of compromising.</head><p>We model compromising as a process of Bayesian updating. The individual has two sources of information to infer the number of animals (N): (i) The individual's personal belief about the number of animals ( ) and social information provided by the peers ( ), with s=1:k, and k being the group size. We model the personal belief as a discretized normal probability distribution centered around first estimate ( 1 ) and associated with uncertainty ( 2 ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">( | ) ∼ ( 1 , 2 ).</formula><p>Similarly, we model social information ( ) as a discretized normal probability distributions centered around peer estimates , with associated uncertainties ( 2 ):</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">( | ) ∼ (<label>, 2 ).</label></formula><p>restricts parameters ′ and ′ between zero and one, and allows us to describe these parameters with beta distributions, each having two hyperparameters controlling their shape (see <ref type="table">Table S6</ref>). Further, note that for the fitting process, we centered the predictors and to their mean values.</p><p>In the fitting procedure we ran 4 chains in parallel with 2,000 iterations each and discarded the first 1000 as burn-in. We reduced the memory load by thinning the chains with a factor of 5. We investigated the importance of four model features: (i) keep heuristic; (ii) the adopt heuristic; and when compromising, (iii) confirmation-based weighting (assigning weight to social information depending on its distance of the personal first estimate), (iv) proximity-based weighting (assigning weight to social information depending its distance to other peer estimates). The importance of each of these features was evaluated by calculating the leave-one-out cross-validation (looic; (55)) of the models containing all possible combinations of these features (16 in total; <ref type="table">Table S3</ref>). We quantified the importance of a feature by calculating the average reduction of the looic when the feature was included rather than excluded <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 2B)</ref>. We report the fittings of the model with the lowest looic <ref type="table">(Table   S4</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameter recovery analysis.</head><p>To ensure that all model parameters are identifiable and influence judgments in an interpretable manner, we conducted a parameter recovery analysis. Specifically, we drew eight sets of model parameters with a quasi-random number generator using the sobol sequence (from the R package randtoolbox (71)) to ensure a uniformly covered multidimensional parameter space within a reasonable parameter range with following ranges: 2 varies within <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, within <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> For each parameter set, we generated second estimates based on first estimates and observed social information from our four experimental conditions.

So, in this block, participants completed 30 rounds in total; the participants' responses in the experimental rounds of this block are the main focus of this study Block 2: Like in Block 1, participants observed an image and made their first estimate of the number of animals on it. Then, they could observe the estimate of one participant who completed the task before, and then make a second estimate.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>This paper makes three novel contributions. First, we experimentally show that the impact of multiple sources of social information strongly depends on its distribution. Increased variance in social information reduces participants' adjustments, and skewness decreases adjustments if a single peer confirms their first estimate. Second, our cognitive model provides a unified account for how people integrate disparate social information, showing that people rely on a combination of simple heuristics of keeping their initial beliefs and compromising towards social information. The model captures how the weight of social information is independently determined by both its degree of confirmation of people's initial beliefs, and its proximity to other pieces of social information. Third and finally, the model made accurate out-of-sample predictions of adjustments in qualitatively different judgment situations, and our simulations illustrate how prioritizing confirmatory social information may exacerbate filter bubble effects and even lead individuals to take up more extreme beliefs.</figDesc></figure>

The results from this one-peer control condition are not the focus of this paper and will not be reported here.Cognitive model.

For instance, they suggest that efforts to de-bias online information that present people with balanced views<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> might not suffice to break filter bubble effects and dynamics of polarization.The current study provides a robust template for understanding social information use in a range of (complex) social environments that people encounter in their day-to-day lives. Future empirical work should test the predictions of our simulations, as well as the extent to which our findings generalise It seems plausible that confirmation effects -and their polarizing consequences -are even stronger in many important real-world contexts involving emotive, moral or political issues. In these (often controversial) contexts, the integration of disparate social information may be further hampered due to 'motivated reasoning'<ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref> or when observed peers belong to an outgroup<ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65)</ref>.Finally, in contrast to our experiment, people are often confronted with different sources of information sequentially. The current experimental design and modeling framework are flexible enough to include adaptations to accommodate each of these elements. By clicking the link to the experimental pages, participants confirmed informed consent. Five participants dropped out during the task and did not receive any payment, resulting in 95 participants (57% male, mean age: 35.8; s.d.=10.7). The online experiment was programmed in LIONESS Lab (66). All code associated with this paper (i.e., experimental software, cognitive model, simulations, and analyses) is publicly available in the public OSF repository https://osf.io/rmcuy/. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development Berlin (ARC 2017/18).

They entered their estimates with a slider limited from 1 to 150 (for screenshots, see Supplementary Information, section Experimental Materials). After submitting their first estimate (E1), they observed the estimates of three other participants (X1, X2 ,X3) who had completed the same task before but without receiving social information.

Our cognitive model provides a detailed picture of the cognitive mechanisms that underlie the integration of disparate social information, highlighting the role of heuristics of keeping one's initial beliefs, and the importance of proximity-and confirmation-based weighting. Finally, our simulations illustrate how confirmation effects can markedly exacerbate filter bubble dynamics and polarization. We anticipate that these findings will provide a useful point of departure for future work aiming to understand the nature of human social information use and its implications for group dynamics, and to inform interventions to effectively de-bias individuals and help them forming accurate beliefs about the world.Methods Behavioral experiment. We recruited 100 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), restricted to US citizens, and to MTurk workers with an approval rate of at least 95%.The experimental task is based on a validated perceptual judgment paradigm for quantifying social information use (BEAST (37); Fig. 1A-C).

Distributions of participants' mean adjustment and correlations across the four experimental conditions. Outer histogram panels show frequency distributions of participants' mean adjustments ( ̅ ) towards the mean social information for each condition (LN: low variance, no skewness; HN: high variance, no skewness; HF: high variance, cluster of two peers relatively far from the participants first estimate; HC: high variance, cluster of two peers relatively near to the participant's first estimate). Left (right) grey areas in each panel represent values of ̅ below 0 (above 1). Across conditions, almost all participants had, on average, an ̅ value between 0 and 1, implying they did not adjust away from the social information (i.e., ̅ &lt; 0), nor adjust beyond the mean social information (i.e., ̅ &gt; 1). Scatter plots show correlations between participants' mean ̅ across the respective conditions. Dots represent participants, and the top left of each panel shows Pearson's r. Overall, we find strong correlations between participants' mean adjustments across conditions (all Pearson correlations P&lt;0.001), indicating consistent inter-individual differences in social information use.

Determinants of participants' social information use. Numbers on the left hand side show results from a Bayesian linear mixed model (fitted with the R-package brms (69) using default priors) fitted to participants' average adjustments towards the mean social information across the rounds of each of the experimental conditions, with 'participant' as varying intercept. Numbers between brackets indicate 95% posterior credibility intervals. On the right hand side, we show pairwise comparisons between experimental conditions. Average adjustments were calculated as the relative distance adjusted towards the mean social information <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1D</ref>), across the five rounds of each of the four experimental conditions (LN, HN, HF, HC; <ref type="figure">Fig. 1E</ref>), yielding four data points for each participant. We omitted those rounds in which a participant adjusted away from the mean social information. The LN condition was used as the baseline. Relative to that baseline, the HN and HF conditions had a strong negative effect. The HC condition had a smaller negative effect. Pairwise comparisons indicate that, except for the HN and HF conditions, all pairs of experimental conditions differed significantly from each other. Age and gender did not seem to affect social information use. To quantify the participants' constancy of displayed behaviour across conditions we also derived the commonly used index of 'repeatability' for this model (R=0.790 [0.697, 0.839]) (69).</p></div>
