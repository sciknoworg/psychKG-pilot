			<abstract>
				<p>The ability to adapt behavior in the face of social feedback is an important component of social competency. In many social contexts, the most appropriate behavior depends on who we are interacting with, and the current value we place in their response. In this paper, we used a devaluation method to examine the extent to which participants use and update flexible representations of social outcome identity and value. In a series of experiments, participants learned actions that were associated with positive social feedback as outcomes from two different identities. In study 1a, we found that devaluing one of the identities, by learning negative information about them, reduced preferences for the action associated with the positive social outcome from that identity. This preference change occurred without participants requiring additional action-social outcome learning. Neutral (Study 1b) and positive (Study 2) information did not alter preferences. Learning negative information before learning the actionsocial outcome (Study 3) slowed reaction time during learning, but did not impair learning the association for the devalued identity. However, it did reduce the preference for actions associated with that identity. Study 4 replicated Study 1a with a different source of negative information. These results are consistent with individuals using a model-based representation of the identity and current value of social outcomes to guide the choice of actions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Social Devaluation</head><p>To succeed in a social world, we need to be able to adjust our actions depending on who we are interacting with and the goal we wish to achieve. Behaviors that might be appropriate when playing with our children might be less appropriate for an important job interview. Similarly, if the mood of our child changes, or we learn some less desirable details of the prospective job, we might need to update our goal and modify our behavior. Difficulties in adjusting behaviors to suit a social situation or changing goal are common across a range of clinical conditions, including depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Weightman et al., 2014)</ref>, schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Green et al., 2015)</ref>, autism spectrum disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Baron-Cohen &amp; Belmonte, 2005)</ref>, and ventral/orbital frontal lobe injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rolls et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bechera et al., 1996 )</ref>. Understanding how we update and adapt out social behavior based on who we are interacting with, or changes to our social goals, is important to understanding problems of social competence in these conditions.</p><p>Feedback from others can help us choose behaviors that are socially appropriate. Verbal praise, vocalizations of approval, and nonverbal facial expressions, have long been considered an effective ways to reinforce behavior <ref type="bibr">(Bandura &amp; MacDonald, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Spielberger et al., 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lott &amp; Lott, 1969)</ref>.</p><p>Positive feedback of online behavior can reinforce the expression of moral outrage <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brady et al., 2021)</ref>, and social feedback has been suggested to be an important contributor to offline moral and prosocial behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Lockwood et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Gesiarz &amp; Crockett, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ho et al., 2017)</ref>. Nonverbal positive feedback, such as a smiling face, can reinforce actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Averbeck &amp; Duchaine, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shore &amp; Heerey, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Heerey, &amp; Gilder 2019)</ref> and increase generosity and cooperation in economic games <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rychlowska et al., 2021)</ref>. However, the context of the smile can matter: a smile from someone immediately after they were uncooperative might not be all that rewarding <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rychlowska et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, while a particular action might lead to a laugh or smile once or twice, repeating that action too frequently might lead to a negative reaction from others. This suggests that a simple learning mechanism based on nonverbal social feedback might be insufficient to explain flexible social decision-making. Social Devaluation Recent computational models of value-based decision making differentiate between model-free and model-based reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Daw et al., 2005)</ref>, and this distinction has recently been suggested to apply to social decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cushman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">FeldmanHall &amp; Nassar, 2021)</ref>. In model-free decision-making, we learn the value of an action based on the history of that action leading to a reward, such as positive social feedback, through repeated trial and error. We then select the act ion with the highest value. In model-based decision-making, we instead use a model of the external environment, including (potentially) the mental states of individuals with whom we are interacting, and represent the current value of different potential outcomes. For example, we might hold a representation of the current value of positive feedback from a particular individual, as well as a model of the various factors that likely lead to that outcome; when deciding how to act, we select the actions that we predict will lead to that social outcome. Model-based learning allows us to adapt our actions based on the individual with whom we are interacting. By representing the value of future outcomes of actions, rather than the value of actions themselves, we can adjust our actions if the value of that outcome changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Drummond &amp; Niv, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Outcome devaluation is a standard method for distinguishing model-based and model-free decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kahnt &amp; Schoenbaum, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Daw et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Balleine, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Balleine &amp; Dickinson, 1998)</ref>.</p><p>In studies of selective or identity-specific devaluation (of nonsocial outcomes), an actor first learns to make two difference responses (e.g., lever pressing and chain pulling), with each response paired with its own reinforcer (food versus sucrose liquid) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Colwill &amp; Rescorla, 1985)</ref>. One of the outcomes is then devalued, either by consuming that outcome until satiation or pairing it with an aversive flavor or poison. Following selective devaluation, animals show a reduced production of the response associated with the devalued outcome, while the response associated with the non-devalued outcome is unchanged. Changing the value of one outcome selectively reduces the associated responding, indicating that actions in these paradigms are guided by a representation of the value of a specific 5 Social Devaluation future outcome, rather than the value of an action based on learning history, consistent with modelbased decision making. Selective devaluation of food rewards has been shown to influence human value-based decisions. For example, selective devaluation of food outcomes led to sigificant differences in self-reported pleasantness of devalued and non-devalued outcomes along with differential BOLD activity recorded in the orbitofrontal cortex when viewing cues associated with food outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gottfried et al, 2003)</ref>. Consistent with the proposed role of prefrontal cortex in adaptive value-based decision making, Howard and colleagues showed that identity-specific devaluation modified neural representations of food odor outcomes in ventromedial and orbitofrontal cortex <ref type="bibr">(Howard &amp; Khant, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Howard et al., 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Given the evidence that selective devaluation can help distinguish model-based from model-free decisions, we examined if selective devaluation of social outcomes would influence value-based social decision-making in human participants. While the best way to satiate social rewards is not readily apparent, there is evidence that learning new affective information about an individual can change evaluations of that individual. For example, pairing faces with verbal descriptions of positive or negative behaviors (e.g., 'Hit a small child') can change explicit <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bliss-Moreau et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Verosky &amp; Todorov, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Verosky et al., 2018)</ref> and implicit <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Shen &amp; Ferguson, 2021)</ref> responses to those faces.</p><p>The strength of these effects depends in part on both the extremity and the reliability of the described behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Shen &amp; Ferguson, 2021)</ref>, and appears to be stronger for descriptions of social behaviors than non-social behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bliss-Moreau et al., 2008)</ref>. While these previous studies have demonstrated that learning new affective information about a face can change explicit and implicit evaluations of the face, we hypothesized that by changing the value of the identity represented by the face, we would also change the representation of social feedback from that individual as an action outcome. We therefore hypothesized that actions associated with the devalued identity as an outcome would be less likely to be produced than actions associated with the non-devalued face. Furthermore, we predicted that we would 6 Social Devaluation see devaluation-based changes to behavior with no new learning needed between actions and outcomes, consistent with model-based social decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1a</head><p>The goal of Study 1a was to examine if participants use a flexible representation of the value of individuals providing social feedback as outcomes to guide decision making. In this study, and in those on the remainder of this paper, we borrowed heavily from the paradigms of the reinforcement learning literature to investigate this question. We first had participants rate the faces of two individuals on a number of social variables, and then they learned that one action would lead to positive nonverbal feedback from one individual, while a different action would lead to positive nonverbal feedback from the other. We then examined if the preference for the action associated with the positive feedback from one of the individuals changed when that individual was devalued through a negative vignette.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited using Prolific and were paid $12/hour for participation. We recruited 76 participants (56 female, 17 male, 3 prefer not to answer; mean age = 28.5 years, range=18-66 years).</p><p>The study was approved by the George Mason University International Review Board and in accordance with guidelines from the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p>The face stimuli consisted of color photographs of two male and two female George Mason University undergraduate student actors displaying two expressions (smiling and mouth open neutral).</p><p>The actors wore a white t-shirt and sat in front of a green screen during the photo session. Smiling facial expressions were elicited through positive affect prompts such as "Imagine your partner looking 7 Social Devaluation at you straight in the eyes and saying, "I love you". Neutral facial expressions were elicited by prompting individuals to "lose focus", "keep your face relaxed", "pretend you are at the DMV". Face images were cropped to approximately the same size, color balanced, and the green background replaces by a grey gradient. Four abstract black and white symbols served as the action cues.</p><p>The devaluation vignette was developed from the brief vignettes developed by <ref type="bibr">Knutson et al.</ref> (2010) and originally described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Escobedo (2009)</ref>. We selected a vignette that was high in social norm violation, emotion aversion, emotional intensity, and harm ("Once, when I was a teenager, I was driving drunk down a road. An old farm dog came out into the middle of the road and started barking. I purposely ran right over it and killed it."). We adapted it slightly to add an additional social component, with the resulting vignette as ""Once, when I was a teenager, I was driving drunk down a road. An old farm dog came out into the middle of the road and started barking. I purposely ran right over it and killed it. Later I heard the dogs owner was heartbroken, but I never told anyone about it".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Procedure</head><p>Following completion of the consent page, participants were randomly assigned to rate the two male faces or the two female faces from 0 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree) if they thought the individual shown looked friendly, warm, trustworthy, if they would like to socialize with the individual shown, and if the individual looked like they were good at solving problems <ref type="figure">(Figure 1, top)</ref>.</p><p>Participants then performed a two-arm bandit task, in which they were instructed to try to learn the actions that would make the two individuals shown in the photos happy <ref type="figure">(Figure 1, middle)</ref>. In one arm of the task, the selection of one of the four abstract symbols was followed by the smiling face from one of the actors on 80% of trials, while selection of a different symbol was followed by the neutral face of the same actor on 80% of trials. On the remaining 20% of trials, the opposite expression from the same actor was shown. In the other arm of the task, the same procedure was followed for the remaining abstract symbols and the other actor. Twenty-four trials from each arm were presented in random Social Devaluation interleaved order. The abstract symbols were randomly assigned to outcomes for each participant, and the position of symbols to the right or left of a central fixation cross was randomized for each trial.</p><p>Participants chose the symbol to the left or the right of fixation by pressing either the j or the l key on their keyboard. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Example stimuli and tasks from the four studies. Top: Participants rated two faces on five different items. Middle: Two-arm bandit task in which participants learned the association between choosing symbols and Social Devaluation smiling and neutral faces as outcomes. For 80% of trials, choosing one symbol led to one outcome value from one identity, while on 20% of trials choosing the same symbol led to the other outcome value from the same identity. Bottom: Participants then chose between symbols during extinction (no outcome) trials.</p><p>Following the two-arm bandit task, participants were presented with pairs of the abstract symbols, and instructed to choose between them as quickly as possible <ref type="figure">(Figure 1, bottom)</ref>. Symbol pairs included those associated with the smile from each actor (high social value vs high social value), those associated with the neutral face of each actor (low social value vs low social value), and the smile and neutral face (high social value vs low social value) from each actor. Participants chose the symbol to the left or the right of fixation by pressing either the j or the l key on their keyboard. No feedback was provided during this preference task.</p><p>Participants were then presented with the photo of one of the actors above the devaluation vignette, and were asked to read the vignette and imagine the actor in that scenario. Participants were given 30 seconds to read the vignette before they could continue. Participants then completed the face ratings procedure as described above, with the additional instruction that they should "think about everything they have learned about the individuals shown in the photos" when making their ratings.</p><p>After completing the ratings for both the devalued and non-devalued faces, participants completed the preference task a second time. At the completion of the study, participants were presented a debriefing page that explained that the vignette described was entirely fictional.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Proportions (two-arm bandit learning accuracy and choice preference) were logit transformed, and reaction times were log transformed prior to statistical analysis. To aid the inference process we adopted a combined Bayesian-Frequentist approach. Bayesian linear mixed models (L.M.M.s) were performed using Stan and the rethinking (McElreath, 2020) and rstan <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Stan Development Team, 2022)</ref> packages in R. Within-participant effects were treated as fixed effects, with random effects intercept for Social Devaluation between-participant variance. Weakly informed priors for coefficients β~ Normal (0,10) and variance σ Cauchy (0,2.5) were used, although all effects were robust to different Normal priors with variances ranging from 1 to 100. Posterior distributions were estimated using a dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler <ref type="bibr">(Betancourt, 2017)</ref> with 8000 samples and a 4000 sample burn-in across 4 chains. The likelihood model was then used in a frequentist analysis using the lme4 package <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref>   We first examined if ratings of the devalued and non-devalued faces changed following the devaluation vignette. Ratings on each of the scales were analyzed with linear mixed effects models. We  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. As is shown, ratings of the two faces did not differ prior to devaluation. After devaluation, ratings of the devalued face, but not the non-devalued face, decreased considerably on all of the ratings.  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>, prior to devaluation participants chose actions associated with the two outcome identities about equally often, for both the high value outcome (smiling) and the low outcome value (neutral face). However, after devaluation, participants were less likely to choose the action associated with the devalued outcome identity; however, this effect was limited to the high value outcome (smiling). We also observed a significant time (pre-vs post-devaluation) by condition  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>). After devaluation, however, participants showed a decreased preference for the actions associated with high value outcomes, but only for the devalued outcome identity. It should be noted that measurement of preferences was done under extinction, and so does not reflect new learning about action-outcome relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We observed that devaluing an individual, through learning new, negative information about that individual, decreased the value of positive nonverbal outcomes associated with them. As a consequence, participants who had previously associated the positive feedback as an outcome of their Social Devaluation actions were less likely to produce those actions. These results indicate that participants can represent actions reinforced by a social outcome in a manner that is sensitive to the current value of the outcome, rather than as the value of the action previously learned through trial-and-error. The effect of the outcome devaluation procedure used in the present study was limited to the individual who was the target of the devaluation, and actions associated with that individual, indicating that this was not due to something less specific, like an increase in negative affect following the vignette.</p><p>The identity-specific nature of the outcome devaluation effect we observed is consistent with participants using a model of the associations between actions and the possible outcomes of these actions. Participants did not need to relearn the association between actions and the newly-valued outcome in order to change their behavior; instead, simply learning something negative about the person who's positive feedback comprised that outcome was enough to change behavior. While the results of the present study are consistent with findings from outcome devaluation studies using nonsocial outcomes, we should acknowledge the possibility that it was not the value of the vignette per se that changed behavior. Instead, it is possible, though unlikely, that simply learning new information about one of the outcome identities, or paying extra attention to it, might have altered preference for the action associated with it. While such a possibility does not necessarily negate the conclusion of modelbased social decision-making, it would alter conclusions based on the value-based processes involved.</p><p>We examine this possibility in Study 1b.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1b</head><p>The goal of Study 1b was to control for the effect learning of new information about one of the outcome identities on the preference for actions associated with those outcomes. We developed a neutral vignette that we hypothesized would not change the value of the individual who was the subject of the story. We then hypothesized that this neutral vignette would not lead to outcome devaluationbased changes in action preference. Social Devaluation</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the present study, we observed that reading a neutral vignette about an individual did not change the value of positive feedback as an outcome associated with the individual. Participants chose actions associated with outcomes from the vignette individual with approximately the same probability Social Devaluation as choosing actions associated with outcomes from the non-vignette individual. Under extinction, participants chose actions associated with the high value outcome more than the low value outcome for each identity. In Study 1a, we observed that a negative vignette devalued the high value outcomes associated with the individual the vignette was about. Together with the findings of the present study, these results suggest that the decreased choice of action associated with the devalued outcome was not a result of the additional familiarity or attention associated with learning new information about one outcome face. Instead, these results are consistent with a change in the value of outcomes associated with the individual who was the subject of the vignette, and indicate participants use representations of the value of social outcomes when choosing actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>In Study 1a we reported that devaluing the source of a social outcome, via a negative vignette, reduced the choice of actions associated with that outcome. As was observed in Study 1b, a neutral vignette did not produce a similar change in action preference, consistent with the hypothesis that the negative vignette changed the value of the outcome. In Study 2, we examined if a positive vignette could increase the value of the outcome, and thus increase the choice of action associated with it.</p><p>Changing the desirability of an outcome, such as through a change in the motivational state of a participant, increases the expression of actions associated with that outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Holland &amp; Petrovich, 2005</ref>).

Negative behaviors appear to be considered more diagnostic than positive behaviors for evaluations of others. We therefore sought to examine if learning positive information about an individual providing positive feedback as an action outcome would increase the value of that outcome.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study examined if learning new, positive affective information about an identity would increase preferences for actions that are associated with that identity as an outcome. While the positive vignette increased positive ratings of the identity that was the target of the vignette, these positive Social Devaluation evaluations did not transfer to outcome-guided actions. Previous studies have reported that learning new positive information about a face can increase explicit evaluations of that face <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bliss-Moreau et al., 2008)</ref>. However, it has been noted that it is more difficult to change implicit measures of evaluation with positive information. One proposal is that people consider negative information as more diagnostic of another persons' character than positive information <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Shen &amp; Ferguson, 2021)</ref>. While participants in the present study might have considered the character in the vignette as having done a good deed, that might not have translated to considering them a good person (or, considering them a better person than before reading the vignette).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3</head><p>In Study 3 we examined the nature of social feedback-based learning in more detail. In particular, we examined the extent to which acquisition of the association between an action and its social outcome (a smiling face) depends on the value of the identity providing feedback. While the effects of outcome devaluation observed in Study 1a indicate that the value of the social outcome influences subsequent choice behavior, previous research has shown that individuals encode multiple features (sensory, value) of an outcome during instrumental learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Delamater, 2007)</ref>. In this study, we devalued one of the two outcome identities, using the negative vignette, prior to acquisition of the action-outcome association.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In Study 3 we examined if participants learn associations between actions and sensory or other non-motivational properties of social outcomes. Here we found that devaluing a source of social feedback, via a negative vignette about that identity, slowed reaction time during subsequent learning, but did not impair learning accuracy. This suggests that learning the association between an action and the positive feedback from an individual was more difficult if that individual was considered negatively, but could still be successfully acquired. This suggests that participants can learn sensory or other features about a social outcome and their association with actions. Importantly, we still observed a decreased preference for actions associated with that outcome, indicating that participants were able to correctly assign the value of the outcome to the action-outcome association. These data suggest that we might be able to successfully learn about behaviors that lead to positive feedback from an individual 25 Social Devaluation we do not like or consider negatively, even if we do not choose to engage in these behaviors. Such learning and flexibility is critical for success in professional and other settings when we can't always choose who we are interacting with.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4</head><p>In Study 1a and Study 3 we found that a negative vignette decreased the value of social feedback from the individual whom the vignette was about, and decreased the preference for actions associated with this social feedback. In Studies 1b and 2 we observed that neutral and positive vignettes, respectively, did not change preferences for actions. To ensure the effects of the negative vignette were not specific to some idiodyncratic features of the vignette itself, and to replicate the findings of Study 1a, we examined if a different negative vignette would produce similar results to Study 1a.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited using Prolific and were paid $12/hour for participation. We recruited 84 participants (58 female, 25 male, 1 prefer not to say; mean age = 38.5 years, range=20-83 years).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p>Stimuli were the same as for Study 1a, aside from the different negative vignette. For this vignette, we adapted a vignette used by <ref type="bibr">Shen &amp; Ferguson (2022)</ref>: "[Taylor/Alex] was recently arrested and convicted of arson and attempted murder after setting fire to [his/her] neighbor's apartment. Police say that the offense occurred following a noise dispute between the neighbors. The neighbor and her infant child were lucky to escape the fire alive, and the child is still in hospital with burns.</p><p>[Taylor/Alex] admitted to the offense but did not express remorse, saying that the neighbor 'deserved what happened'." Social Devaluation</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Procedure</head><p>Procedures were the same as in Study 1a. Participants completed the consent page, rated the faces, completed the two-arm bandit learning task, chose between actions, read the vignette, rated the faces a second time, and then chose between actions again.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Data were transformed and analyzed using R and Stan as in the previous studies. We observed a  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">Figure 10</ref>. As is shown, ratings of the two faces did not differ prior to devaluation. After devaluation, ratings of the devalued face, but not the non-devalued face, decreased considerably on all of the ratings. Social Devaluation  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">Figure 11</ref>, prior to devaluation participants chose actions associated with the two outcome identities about equally often, for both the high value outcome (smiling) and the low outcome value (neutral face). Social Devaluation However, after devaluation, participants were less likely to choose the action associated with the devalued outcome identity; however, this effect was limited to the high value outcome (smiling). We also observed a significant time (pre-vs post-devaluation) by condition (devalued vs non-devalued) interaction on preference for actions associated with high versus low value outcomes ( L.M.M. Bayes β = 1.48 [0.60, 2.32]; L.M.M. Freq t(248) = 2.52, p &lt;0.05). Prior to devaluation, participants preferred the actions associated with the high value outcome (smiling) over those associated with the low value outcome (neutral face), consistent with the learning task performance <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">(Figure 11</ref>). After devaluation, however, participants showed a decreased preference for the actions associated with high value outcomes, but only for the devalued outcome identity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion Social Devaluation</head><p>In this study we replicated the findings of Study 1a, observing that devaluing an individual decreased the value of positive nonverbal outcomes associated with them. In Study 4, we used a different negative vignette to that of Study 1a (and Study 3), but still found similar effects. After learning new, negative information about an identity providing social feedback as an outcome, participants were less likely to produce actions associated with that outcome. These results suggest that the results of Study 1a and 3 are not simply due to the particular vignette used. As we also showed in Study 1a, the results of this study indicate that individuals use both the value and identity of a social outcome to guide behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Adaptive social behavior requires that we be able to change our behavior to suit the person we are interacting with and the value we place in their feedback. Across a series of studies we have shown that participants can quickly update their representations of the value of social feedback, and alter their behavior as a consequence. The results of the studies in this paper indicate that participants can represent actions reinforced by a social outcome in a manner that is sensitive to the current value of the outcome, rather than as the value of the action previously learned through trial-and-error.</p><p>We used negative stories/vignettes to devalue one of the identities providing social feedback.</p><p>The changes to behavior that we observed were restricted to the actions associated with feedback from that identity, rather than a non-specific change due to factors such as mood. The effects of the negative vignettes on ratings and representations of the identities who were the target of the vignette are consistent with previous studies showing that learning new affective information can change explicit and implicit evaluations of an individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bliss-Moreau et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Shen &amp; Ferguson, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Verosky &amp; Todorov, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Verosky et al., 2018)</ref>. While effects of both positive and negative affective information have been reported, there is some suggestion that negative information is considered more diagnostic of an individual's character, and thus more likely to change perceptions of them <ref type="bibr">(Cone &amp; Social Devaluation Ferguson, 2015)</ref>. We found that while a positive vignette increased explicit ratings of the face of the individual who was the target of the vignette, only the negative vignettes changed outcome-based choice behavior. It is possible, however, that other positive vignettes that contain information that is considered more diagnostic of the character in the vignette might have an effect on outcome-based behavior.</p><p>In Studies 1a and 4 we observed that learning new, negative information about a social outcome led participants to choose actions associated with that social outcome. As noted earlier, the change in behavior observed after devaluation by the vignette did not involve learning any new information about the relationship between the action and the (newly valued) outcome. Instead, participants rapidly altered their behavior on the basis of the new representation of the social outcome. These effects are consistent with individuals using a model-based process when making decisions about social behaviors, as outcome devaluation-sensitive behaviors are a hallmark of model-based decision making. The results of this study indicate that individuals use a cognitive model of those they are interacting with, which includes evaluations of the character of interlocutors.</p><p>In the studies performed in this paper, we had participants learn that one action would lead to a smile from one identity, while a different action would lead to a smile from a different identity. The reinforcing properties of a smiling face have been reported previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Averbeck &amp; Duchaine, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Shore &amp; Heerey, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Heerey, 2014)</ref>. Smiles can also lead to increased approach behavior and generosity <ref type="bibr">(Phaf et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">)</ref>. However, as participants in our studies learned the association between actions and specific outcomes, it is likely that they associated multiple properties of the outcome with the different actions, including sensory/perceptual properties related to each face, as well as the motivational properties associated with receiving a smile from someone. In Study 3, we demonstrated that participants were able to learn the association between actions and specific outcome identities, even when one of the identities had been devalued prior to learning. We suggest that participants Social Devaluation learned this association by linking the sensory features of the outcome to the action that produced it. Reaction time was slowed during this learning, suggesting that learning was more difficult than when positive motivational properties of the outcome were available. After learning the association, participants were able to link the (negative) motivational value of that outcome to the associated action.</p><p>This suggests that learning social behaviors is highly flexible, and able to use multiple properties of outcomes to guide actions. Knowing what behaviors lead to positive responses from others, even if we hold a very negative evaluation of another, is a highly adaptive skill. We don't always get to chose with whom we must interact, and it can be valuable to know how to interact successfully with those we might personally dislike or mistrust.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>in R.

Right: Posterior means, 95% HDIs, and individual participant data for action-outcome learning reaction time for the vignette and non-vignette identity. No significant difference was observed in learning accuracy for actions leading to the to-be devalued and non-devalued outcomes on the two-arm bandit task ( L.M.M. Bayes β = -0.03 [-0.35, 0.27]; L.M.M. Freq t(83) = -0.22, p &gt;0.05). Similarly, there was no significant difference in reaction time for actions leading to the to-be devalued and non-devalued outcomes on the two-arm bandit task ( L.M.M. Bayes β = -0.04 [-0.08, 0.01]; L.M.M. Freq t(83) = -1.66, p &gt;0.05). Posterior means and 95% HDIs of accuracy and reaction time are presented in Figure 10. To examine the effects of social outcome devaluation on decision-making, we examined if preferences for actions associated with the devalued outcome identity versus those associated with the non-devalued outcome identity. We found a significant time (pre-vs post-devaluation) by value (high vs low) interaction on action preference ( L.M.M. Bayes β = -1.37 [-2.37, -0.34]; L.M.M. Freq t(249) = -2.04 p &lt;0.05).
