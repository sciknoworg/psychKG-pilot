			<abstract>
				<p>Unfamiliar face identification is a challenging task and is often considered to be perceptual in nature. This ignores the contribution of decision making in face identification. Across three experiments, we examined whether face-matching decisions would change depending on the framing of response options. In Experiment 1, participants completed an unfamiliar face matching task with the Same/Different, Same/Not-Same or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. In Experiment 2, participants completed the task twice, once with the Same/Different response options and once with the Same/Different, Same/Not-Same or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. In Experiment 3, participants completed the task when 50% or 80% of trials were matches and used the Same/Different or Same/Proceedto-Next-Trial response options. Whereas we found no evidence that face identification decisions were influenced by the framing of response options, we found evidence of a robust base rate effect. Together these findings suggest that decision making in unfamiliar face identification is a complex and selective process.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General audience summary</head><p>Photographic identity documents are used in a many applied settings, such as when crossing international borders or purchasing age-restricted goods. However, facial image comparison is difficult for lay persons and professionals; this is because images of the same person can look very different and different people can look very similar. This premise has resulted in a focus on the perceptual difficulties in unfamiliar face identification; we used a novel approach and instead focused on decision-making aspect of this task. There is an abundance of evidence to suggest that the way in which questions, or the corresponding response options, are posed influences decision making. Here, we examine whether the way in which the response options are posed influenced decision making in unfamiliar face identification. Just as in these applied settings, participants determined whether pairs of faces were of the same person. Critically, they made these decisions with neutral response options (i.e., Same/Different), which should not bias participants towards making either response, or biased response options (e.g., Same/Not-Same; Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial), which should bias responses towards making more "same" responses. Because in most applied settings it is much more likely that a person is presenting a valid photographic identity document, we also manipulated how often face pairs depicted images of the same person. Although participants' decisions were not influenced by the framing of response options, they responded "same" more often when more of the trials depicted two images of the same identity. These results highlight the importance of understanding factors that influence face-matching decisions.</p><p>While the framing of response options cannot be used to influence performance in applied settings, informing individuals of the frequency of matched versus mismatched documents might reduce the most egregious errors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision-making framing in facial image comparison</head><p>Societies depend on person identification from photo-identity documents, a task known as facial image comparison in police and border security settings. Despite its widespread use, facial comparison is challenging as two photos of the same person can look very different and images of two people can look remarkably similar. In Psychology, this process is examined using unfamiliar face matching tasks, wherein participants make identity judgements for pairs of face images that depict the same person (matches) or different people (mismatches). This research shows that face matching is error prone for lay participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Burton et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fysh &amp; Bindemann, 2018)</ref>, security professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Towler et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">White et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Wirth &amp; Carbon, 2017)</ref> and photographers, who understand variation in facial appearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Baker &amp; Mondloch, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>As this challenge relies on similarity judgments of faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Baker &amp; Mondloch, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Burton, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Jenkins et al., 2011)</ref>, it is often approached as a perceptual problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Bindemann &amp; Burton, 2021)</ref>. However, there is evidence that it is also a decisionmaking problem, as the perceptual information in facial images can be dissociated from responses. Different observers often make distinct decisions to the same faces <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Bindemann et al., 2012a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fysh &amp; Bindemann, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Stantic et al., 2022)</ref> and also vary their identification decisions to the same faces over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alenezi &amp; Bindemann, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Alenezi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Bindemann et al., 2012b)</ref>. This should not arise if these errors simply reflect the available visual information in faces and points to inconsistencies in how this information is used to make identification decisions. Contextual manipulations, such as the provision of example stimuli, also influence identification decisions even though visual information is held constant <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Gentry &amp; Bindemann, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Papesh et al., 2018)</ref>. Consequently, there have been calls to integrate decision making into models of face matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Bindemann &amp; Burton, 2021</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISION FRAMING IN FACIAL IMAGE COMPARISON 5</head><p>Decision-making models postulate that evidence is compared to a decision threshold <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Ratcliff et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Summerfield &amp; Egner, 2014)</ref>. For example, in experiments utilising signal detection theory, binary decisions depend on the available evidence and position of one's decision boundary or threshold (i.e., criterion; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Stanislaw &amp; Todorov, 1999)</ref>. A decision is reached when there is sufficient evidence relative to one's criterion, indicating that that the evidence was likely obtained from one distribution (an identity match) over another (a mismatch). Investigating criterion can provide a means of understanding decision making in face identification.</p><p>In face matching, individual differences in criterion placement are stable across time and tasks, indicating that observers engage consistent decision-making processes )-a finding that is robust across stimulus categories and measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aminoff et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Baldassari et al., 2019)</ref>. However, individuals shift their criterion in situations that are characterized by uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Lynn &amp; Barrett, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lynn et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Summerfield &amp; Tsetsos, 2012)</ref>, such as when identity matches and mismatches occur with different frequencies (unequal base rates) and different costs are associated with these responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Stabile et al., 2024)</ref>. Thus, criterion for these identification decisions can be influenced independently of the perceptual information conveyed by the faces.</p><p>Little is known about manipulations that influence face-matching decisions, such as whether the demands of this task must be changed directly or whether it is sufficient to change observers' task concept. There is evidence that changes to the task concept can influence face-matching decisions. In comparison to laboratory face-matching tasks, participants' decision-making boundaries (criterion) shift towards match responses in airport settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bindemann et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tummon et al., 2019)</ref> and when faces are embedded in photographic identity documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Feng &amp; Burton, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">McCaffery &amp; Burton, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>It has been proposed that these effects might reflect participants' implicit expectations that DECISION FRAMING IN FACIAL IMAGE COMPARISON 6 most document bearers and their photographic identity documents are identity matches, even if they look quite different <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bindemann et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Feng &amp; Burton, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, 2021</ref>.</p><p>Given that expectations have been shown to influence perception in other domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bang &amp; Rahnev, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Haarsma et al., 2025;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Stein &amp; Peelen, 2015)</ref>, it is possible that they might also affect face matching. For example, implicit expectation effects have been induced by changing the framing of response options in the perceptual discrimination of the orientation of Gabor patches <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2008)</ref>. Observers classified two stimulus categories using A/B response options, which should not induce expectations that one category is more probable than the other, or A/Not-A response options, which could indicate that the 'A' category is more probable. Participants were faster to make 'A' decisions in the A/Not-A than the A/B condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2008)</ref>. These effects also occur for decision criterion in recognition memory tasks when test questions are framed as 'is the item old?' compared to 'is the item new?' <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Leynes, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mill &amp; O'Connor, 2014</ref>).</p><p>Similar effects have been observed in the heuristics and decision-making literature.</p><p>Individuals often respond differently to the same problem depending on how it is framed, despite evidence not differing between separate versions <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981</ref>; see <ref type="bibr">Keren, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kühberger, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maule &amp; Villejoubert, 2020)</ref>. For example, framing a bag of chips as having '60% less salt' compared to '40% salt' can result in considerable differences in consumer behaviour. One explanation for such effects is that problems are represented in terms of gains and losses relative to a reference point, which can vary because of observers' expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981)</ref>. Indeed, framing effects have even been adapted for use in other fields such as politics, environmental issues and health <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Gong et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Homar &amp; Cvelbar, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lechler &amp; de Vreese, 2011)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">DECISION FRAMING IN FACIAL IMAGE COMPARISON 7</ref> Considering the prevalence of framing effects, we examined whether this influences decision making in unfamiliar face matching, too. Across three experiments, participants were randomly assigned to a biased response option condition (Same/Not-Same; Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial) or a neutral response option condition (Same/Different), following a similar format utilised in the perceptual decision-making literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2008)</ref>. We examined how the framing of response options affected observers' sensitivity (d′) to facial information, their decision-making boundaries (criterion), and the difference in response times for match and mismatch trials. Considering framing and expectation effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bang &amp; Rahnev, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981)</ref>, we hypothesised that d′ would be unaffected by these response options but criterion would differ. Essentially, more face pairings would be classified as matches (liberal criterion) in the Same/Not-Same and Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial conditions compared to the Same/Different condition. Based upon the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Summerfield and Koechlin (2008)</ref>, we expected participants would respond faster on match than mismatch trials in the Same/Not-Same and Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial conditions compared to the Same/Different condition. This is because an increased expectation of match trials might lead to an increased readiness or reduced evidence required for faster executions of 'same' responses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Ninety white young adults (Nfemale = 55, Mage = 28.27 years, SDage = 5.18) participated in this experiment. These participants were recruited via prolific.com (n = 82) for a small fee (£4.50) or from the School of Psychology at the University of Kent (n = 8) for course credit.</p><p>This sample size was determined using a priori analyses in G*Power <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Faul et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Faul et al., 2009)</ref> for a one-way ANOVA with three levels (Same/Different, Same/Not-Same, Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial), with power of 0.80, an alpha threshold of 0.05, and an effect size of 0.33 (a medium-large effect). Whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stabile et al. (2024)</ref> found a large effect in a within-subject design, our calculations are based on a medium-large effect, as the current experiment employed a between-subjects design. An additional three participants were tested, but excluded from the analyses because of failed attention checks (n = 3; see stimuli section) or failure to report the correct response options that they used during the task (n = 0; see Procedure section). All participants provided informed consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli</head><p>Participants completed the short version of the Kent Face Matching Test (KFMT), which comprises 20 match and 20 mismatch face pairings <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fysh &amp; Bindemann, 2018)</ref>. Each face pair consists of an image taken from student identity cards, at a size of 142 x 192 pixels with a screen resolution of 72 ppi, and a passport-style face portrait at a size of 283 x 332 pixels. A screen calibration (see Procedure) maintained the aspect ratio and sizes of all images across participants. In identity matches, two photographs of the same person were DECISION FRAMING IN FACIAL IMAGE COMPARISON 9 paired. In mismatches, photographs of two different people of similar appearance were combined.</p><p>In addition to these 40 face pairings, four further stimulus pairs were created to serve as attention checks. The aim of these attention checks was to create a set of face pairings that could be resolved easily. In two of these displays, identical face photographs were paired to serve as image matches. In the other two displays, a male and a female face were combined as sex mismatches. These pairs were created from additional trials of the KFMT-long form <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Fysh &amp; Bindemann, 2018)</ref>. These trials were randomly intermixed with the test stimuli and presented at the same size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>All participants were tested using an online platform (www.pavlovia.org). Prior to the face-matching task, a screen calibration was conducted to ensure that the stimuli were presented with a correct aspect ratio and size. Participants adjusted an image of an on-screen credit card to the dimensions of a physical credit card. Participants then completed 44 trials of the task (i.e., 40 KFMT trials and four attention-check trials). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups in which they were either asked to classify the face pairings as Same/Different, Same/Not-Same or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial; 30 participants were assigned to each condition. In the Same/Different condition, participants were informed that their 'task was to determine whether the pair of images were of the same person or of different people'. In the Same/Not-Same condition, participants were informed that their 'task was to determine whether the pair of images were of the same person or not of the same person'. In the Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial condition, participants were informed that their 'task was to determine whether the pair of images were of the same person. If the trial did not contain two images of the same identity, [they were] to proceed to the next trial'.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISION FRAMING IN FACIAL IMAGE COMPARISON 10</head><p>Each trial comprised a pair of face images being presented in the centre of the screen.</p><p>The face pair remained on screen until participants indicated their response. Participants were asked to press the 'F' key for 'Same' responses and the 'J' key for all other responses (i.e., Different, Not-Same, Proceed-to-Next-Trial). The response options remained on screen throughout to ensure that participants were always aware of the task at hand. Performance was not incentivized and feedback for the accuracy of responses was not provided. Trial order was randomised for each participant.</p><p>Immediately following completion of the task, participants were asked to report the response options that they used throughout the experiment. This enabled us to be more confident that any effects were the result of participants attending to the response options.</p><p>This protocol was pre-registered on OSF (https://osf.io/fs5kd) and all corresponding data for each experiment are available online (https://osf.io/c6yqa/).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>In a preliminary analysis, we analysed the proportion of correct responses for the three experimental conditions (Same/Different, Same/Not-Same, Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial). This shows that just over 60% of face pairs were classified correctly and is comparable to the normative data for the short KFMT (66%; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fysh &amp; Bindemann, 2018)</ref>. Here and throughout, all null effects were followed up with Bayesian analyses using JASP 0.18. We found no effect of response options on accuracy. These findings are reflected by a one-way ANOVA, F(2, 87) = 0.42, p = 0.66, η 2 = 0.01, BF10 = 0.14. All data are displayed in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> and summary statistics are also provided in the supplementary file S1. These data comprise all values, including separate means for match and mismatch accuracy and response times (RTs).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISION FRAMING IN FACIAL IMAGE COMPARISON 11</head><p>For our primary analyses, we converted these data into the signal detection measures of d′ and criterion using hits (defined here as correct 'same' responses on match trials) and false alarms (defined here as incorrect 'same' responses on mismatch trials). In contrast to previous studies that have analysed match and mismatch accuracy independently (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Bobak et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Megreya &amp; Bindemann, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Ritchie &amp; Burton, 2017)</ref>, we adopted this approach specifically to investigate changes in decision-making criterion as a function of response-option framing. Participant responses on both match and mismatch trials are influenced by criterion and d′, and the signal detection approach makes it possible to separate these decision-making characteristics from sensitivity to facial information <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Stanislaw &amp; Todorov, 1999)</ref>. For this purpose, hit and false alarm rates of 0 or 1 were corrected using (nSignal or Noise trials − 0.5)/n and 0.5/nSignal or Noise trials, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Macmillan &amp; Kaplan, 1985)</ref>.</p><p>Perfect performance would be reflected in d′ = 3.92. A neutral criterion would be reflected as c = 0. Consistent with our hypothesis that the framing of response options should not affect sensitivity, we found that d′ was comparable across all conditions, F(2, 87) = 0.71, p = 0.49, η 2 = 0.02, BF10 = 0.17. Contrary to our hypothesis that response options should affect criterion, we found that it was comparable across all conditions, F(2, 87) = 1.70, p = 0.19, η 2 = 0.04, BF10 = 0.38.</p><p>Finally, we analysed the RTs across conditions to investigate whether the framing of response options affected the speed with which face pairs were classified. To create this measure, we calculated each participant's median RT (in seconds) using only the trials on which they were correct. This was done separately for match and mismatch trials. We then speed with which participants responded to match and mismatch trials, the one-way ANOVA did not reveal an effect of response-option condition, F(2, 87) = 0.25, p = 0.78, η 2 &lt; 0.01, BF10 = 0.12.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This experiment examined whether the framing of response options affects facematching decisions. In contrast to previous studies with simple visual stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2008)</ref>, the framing of response options did not affect face identification. This was evident across accuracy and sensitivity -and most importantly, RTs and decisionmaking criterion. This is in contrast with findings from face-matching studies in which other variables are manipulated (e.g., match versus mismatch base rates) and produce a reliable criterion shift <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Stabile et al., 2024)</ref>. In Experiment 2, we sought to confirm the absence of response framing effects in face matching by controlling for individual differences. It is also possible that Experiment 1 failed to detect a difference between response-option conditions as sample size estimates were based on medium-large effects. In Experiment 2, power was therefore increased in case response-option framing only produces small effects on face matching.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>In Experiment 1, response conditions were administered on a between-subjects basis.</p><p>However, face matching is characterised by substantial individual differences in accuracy and criterion <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Bobak et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Fysh &amp; Bindemann, 2018)</ref>. The measures of dispersion for Experiment 1 indicate a broad range in individual differences. Thus, individual differences in performance might have masked the effect of response options. Experiment 2 examined this possibility by having participants complete the KFMT twice: Once in a control condition, wherein participants responded to stimuli using the Same/Different response options, and once in an experimental condition,</p><p>wherein participants responded using one of the response conditions from Experiment 1. As within-subjects designs control for individual variability between conditions, this is an DECISION FRAMING IN FACIAL IMAGE COMPARISON 14 effective method for isolating response-option effects. We hypothesised that more face pairings would be classified as identity matches (liberal criterion), and that participants would classify matches faster than mismatches in the Same/Not-Same and Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial conditions, compared to the Same/Different condition-but only during the experimental condition. These interactions would provide evidence that response options affect face-identification decisions. In addition, sample size was also increased substantially in case response options effects are smaller than anticipated.</p></div>

This sample size was determined using a priori analyses in G*Power for a 2 (control condition, experimental condition) x 3 (Same/Different, Same/Not-Same, Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial) mixed-factor ANOVA with power of 0.80, an alpha threshold of 0.05, and an effect size of 0.1 (a small effect).

In the DECISION FRAMING IN FACIAL IMAGE COMPARISON 15 experimental version, participants were randomly assigned to one of the three response options (Same/Different, Same/Not-Same or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial); 63 participants were assigned to each condition.

To confirm that this was not the reason for the null effect between response-option conditions, we conducted a series of exploratory Pearson correlations to investigate the relationship between experimental and control trials for each response-option group. For d′, these correlations were significant in the Same/Different, r(63) = 0.68, p &lt; 0.001; Same/Not-Same, r(63) = 0.72, p &lt; 0.001; and Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial conditions, r(63) = 0.70, p &lt; 0.001.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This experiment demonstrates that the framing of response options does not affect unfamiliar face matching even after accounting for individual differences in performance.</p><p>This was observed across accuracy, sensitivity and, most importantly, decision-making criterion and RTs. As the data from Experiment 2 were collected under more tightly controlled conditions that required participants to complete the face-matching task twice, this strengthens the findings from Experiment 1. However, the question also arises whether this design induced repetition or practice effects that undermine response-option effects. We note that many face-matching studies demonstrate no improvement in face-matching accuracy with such repetition or practice (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alenezi &amp; Bindemann, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">White et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">White et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Towler et al., 2019)</ref> and we controlled for such effects by counterbalancing the response-option tasks. Moreover, to examine whether our design might have reduced variability in individual differences, we also examined the consistency of performance across these repetitions. This revealed strong correlations in performance between the control and experimental conditions, consistent with previous reports (e.g., ). This indicates that task repetition and counter-balancing did not limit our ability to statistically control for individual differences. Collectively, Experiments 1 and 2 therefore suggest that response-option framing does not affect unfamiliar face-matching decisions. This is striking as other variables show reliable criterion shifts in unfamiliar face matching, such as manipulations to match and mismatch base rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Stabile et al., 2024)</ref>. In Experiment 3, we sought to confirm the absence of response-option framing effects in unfamiliar face matching, by combining this with a base rate manipulation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3</head><p>Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that response-option framing does not influence decision-making criterion in face matching. This raises the possibility that criterion shifts might not be possible under these conditions. In contrast, base rate manipulations are effective at inducing criterion shifts in face matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Stabile et al., 2024)</ref>. To better understand the differences in base rates and response options, both factors were manipulated in Experiment 3. Participants were randomly assigned to a neutral base rate condition, in which 50% of trials were matches, or a biased base rate condition, in which 80% of trials were matches. Participants were also randomly assigned to use the Same/Different or Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial response options. This allowed us to examine whether response framing and base rates exert separable effects on face-matching decisions. We hypothesized that more face pairs would be classified as identity matches (liberal criterion) when 80% compared to 50% of trials were matches. If base rate manipulations promote criterion differences, even if response options do not, then this strengthens the case that framing does not influence criterion in a comparable way.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli and Procedure</head><p>The stimuli were the same as in Experiment 1, except for the following changes. To create the base rate manipulation, the number of test trials was increased from 40 to 100.</p><p>Thus, all participants completed the 40 trials from the KFMT short and an additional 60 trials. To add the additional 30 match trials for the equal base rate condition and 60 match trials for the unequal base rate condition, additional face pairs from the long version of the KFMT were added to the stimulus set. However, the long version of the KFMT only provides a limited number of mismatch trials. To create the additional mismatch trials that were required for the equal base rate condition, a further 30 mismatches were constructed from other unused match trials in the long version of the KFMT. For this purpose, one image from each of two unused match trials were combined . In this manner, 30 additional mismatches were created from 60 unused match trials. In a short pilot study, we ensured that the new mismatch trials did not differ in difficulty (M = 0.74; SD = 0.16) than those originally included in the KFMT short (M = 0.67, SD = 0.20), t(14) = 1.59, p = 0.13. These pairs were chosen by one of the experimenters based on physical similarity of the models and maintained the same image appearance and size as in the original stimuli. None of the face identities were repeated across trials.</p><p>The procedure was the same as in Experiment 1, except for the following changes. In Experiment 3, participants were randomly assigned to a response-option condition (Same/Different, Same/Proceed-to-Next-Trial) and to a base rate condition, wherein DECISION FRAMING IN FACIAL IMAGE COMPARISON 22 participants completed the KFMT with either 50% match trials (equal match/mismatch base rates) or 80% match trials (unequal base rates). There were 52 participants assigned to each condition. Participants were informed about the base rate of the trials and the response options that they were to use. At the end of the task, to ensure that participants were cognisant of the response options and base rates that they were to be using, they were asked to report both.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Experiment 3 demonstrates a clear effect of base rate. Relative to the equal base rate condition, participants in the unequal base rate condition made more 'same' than 'different' responses, reflecting a liberal decision-making criterion. This occurred without the provision of feedback or incentives-extending the previous literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Stabile et al., 2024)</ref>. In contrast, the framing of response options did not influence face-matching decisions across accuracy, sensitivity and-most importantly, criterion. As is evident in a range of studies, 40 trials are generally sufficient for establishing criterion effects in face matching (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stabile et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Feng &amp; Burton, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">McCaffery &amp; Burton, 2016)</ref> and also revealed large base rate effects here. These results are corroborated by RTs, which were influenced by base rates, but not response options. Two exploratory analyses, across the full set of 100 trials in Experiment 3 and by combining data from 290 participants across all three experiments, provided further evidence that there was no effect of response options when power is DECISION FRAMING IN FACIAL IMAGE COMPARISON 27 increased substantially. Taken together, this provides strong and consistent evidence that face-matching decisions are malleable in response to base rates, but not the framing of response options.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Although unfamiliar face matching is often approached as a perceptual task, there is evidence that it is also a decision-making problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alenezi &amp; Bindemann, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Bindemann et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Feng &amp; Burton, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stabile et al., 2024)</ref>. We therefore examined whether response-option framing influences face-identification decisions. Across observers' accuracy, sensitivity, RT, and decision-making criterion, we found no evidence that responseoption framing influences face-identification decisions. This pattern persisted after controlling for individual differences in performance and when power was increased by combining data from 290 participants across experiments.</p><p>The absence of a response-option effect is surprising considering the well-established nature of framing effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Keren, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Levin et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr">Maule &amp; Villejouber, 2007)</ref>, and evidence that question and response-option framing alter performance <ref type="bibr">(Lynes, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Mill &amp; O'Connor, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2008)</ref>.

Similarly, the framing of response options on perceptual decisions of lower-level stimuli induces expectations about a stimulus' probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Summerfield &amp; Koechlin, 2008)</ref>. We report evidence against this expectation induction in unfamiliar face-matching decisions 3 . This is likely driven by inherent expectations of the proportion of match and mismatch trials, which are likely anticipated to occur with comparable frequency. This suggests that expectation effects in unfamiliar face matching, such as those in airport settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bindemann et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tummon et al., 2019)</ref> or when stimuli are imbedded in photographic identity documents <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Feng &amp; Burton, 2019</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">, 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">McCaffery &amp; Burton, 2016)</ref>, can override these baseline expectations.</p><p>Unlike the framing of response options, base rate information provides unambiguous information that leaves little room for interpretation.

This might, in combination with participants' expectations, explain why the framing of response options did not affect unfamiliar face-matching decisions. Relying on the framing of response options would have required participants to wilfully sacrifice accuracy.</p><p>Together, these findings indicate that decision making in face identification is a complex and selective process. This complexity is evident in that individuals wilfully use perceptual evidence, such as the appearance of eyebrows and eyes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abudarham &amp; Yovel, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abudarham et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Tyler et al., 2022)</ref>, and non-face information, such as base rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Stabile et al., 2024)</ref>, to inform their decisions. Other studies suggest that directing attention to facial marks/moles improves performance on face-matching tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Towler et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Towler et al., , 2021</ref>. We showed that the evidence used to make these decisions extends beyond perceptual facial information and is more complicated than previously shown. This process is highly selective, as not all external information (e.g., response options, base rates) was weighted equally during face-identification decisions. This might reflect that individuals are both accumulating evidence during their face-matching decisions, and weighting the strength of this information based on its evidentiary value. This possibility is consistent with decision-making models, as evidence weighting is an aspect of the evidence-accumulation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lindow &amp; Betsch, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Ratcliff et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Summerfield &amp; Egner, 2014)</ref>. Indeed, much like there are age-related changes in face identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Baker et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Laurence &amp; Mondloch, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Matthews et al., 2022)</ref>, there are also age-related changes in the weighting of information during evidence accumulation DECISION FRAMING IN FACIAL IMAGE COMPARISON 30 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Lindow &amp; Betsch, 2018</ref>)-a similarity that might explain some of the variance in unfamiliar face identification.</p><p>The studies reported here have several theoretical implications. Face identification is often only considered as if it were a perceptual problem. Most theories and studies fall in line with this assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Bruce &amp; Young, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Valentine, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">O'Toole et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>However, there is a growing body of literature suggesting a role for decision making in face identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alenezi &amp; Bindemann, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stabile et al., 2024)</ref>. Our findings add to this literature by showing the complexity and selectivity of face-identification decisions. We suggest that current conceptualisations of face identification need to be updated to account for decision making, including its complexity, selectivity and the use of non-face information.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>created a difference score by subtracting each participant's mismatch RT from their match RT.
