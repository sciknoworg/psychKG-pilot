				<p>Decision making is a fundamental aspect of cognition that lies at the heart of theories about behaviour, learning, and mental processing. It spans multiple levels of complexity, from high-level planning to low-level movement control and perceptual recognition. Tracking the evolutionary trajectory of this elementary cognitive process can illuminate the foundations of behaviour and brain functions. This paper highlights a previously understudied defining feature of decision mechanisms: the ways in which mutual exclusion between alternatives is achieved. We argue that any decision is defined by a set of mutually exclusive alternatives, and this exclusivity-rather than the specific identity of the alternatives-requires specialized mechanisms. We demonstrate how the physical body of simple decision-making entities can serve as such a mechanism, and that the detachment of these mechanisms from bodily and environmental constraints enabled complex decision-making. Furthermore, while many theories emphasize how the evolution of neural circuits enhanced integration and control through associative structures, we propose that the evolution of mutual exclusion requires non-associative constructions. We conclude that understanding the evolution of these mechanisms is crucial for studying cognitive evolution, and we propose a potential evolutionary trajectory.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choosing between alternatives</head><p>Living creatures constantly make decisionswhere to go, what to do, and how to do itand for those who have a brain, decision-making is one of its fundamental functions. We humans, like other organisms with brains, regularly have to decide which action to undertake. Should we go home or to the grocery store? Should we walk through the park? And more basically, should we turn left or rightor even more fundamentally, should we move our right foot at all? While these decisions aren't always made consciously, they invariably involve choosing one alternative over others. In the biological and behavioural sciences, decision-making research typically focuses on how and why specific alternatives are chosen from available options. Here, we highlight an often-overlooked question: how (and when and where) does a set of mutually exclusive alternatives emerge in the first place? We will demonstrate how analysing decision mechanisms through the lens of the sets of alternatives they enact reveals a fundamental aspect of cognitive evolution: the development of biological organizations that enforce mutual exclusion among these alternatives.</p><p>For our purposes here, making a decision is inherently a process of choosing between mutually exclusive alternatives. It is a strict choice: only one option can be selected at a given time -if two or more options can occur simultaneously, they require no decision. Formally, a decision-making mechanism consists of alternatives, evaluation method, and judgement procedure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>. The judgement procedure is often the focus of physical or physiological theories, such as activity thresholds or control mechanisms in neural circuits <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> . These mechanisms or processes address how one alternative is chosen over others. The evaluation method is often considered in learning models and decision-making theories, and typically by itself comprises of several elements, primarily memory and values (and their update mechanisms). These treatments address the question of why a certain alternative would be favourable over others <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> . The alternatives themselves are generally underprivileged in the literature -they are either assumed to be given by the environment, or at best narrowed down by the brain from those provided by the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Here we discuss the alternatives, and specifically, the evolution of mutually exclusive alternatives. We argue that a major cognitive advancement has been the detachment of the alternatives from the physical environment, and that nervous systems organization facilitated this separation. Importantly, we treat alternatives as the possible effects (or outputs) of a decision, rather than as its inputs. Alternatives need not be 'presented' in any way to some machine that is, in turn, required to choose one of them, but are rather defined as the set of all possible choices. This might seem counterintuitive given our common understanding of 'choices', (such as choosing an apple over a hamburger), but alternatives are implicit in the operation of a choice mechanism and its role within a system. For example, a process that selects the most salient object in the visual field need not specify possible objects in advance -the possible objects are implicitly the alternatives. This definition of alternatives unifies the treatment of perceptual and behavioural decision processes: deciding, or choosing, to 'go left' and that 'an apple is green' are fundamentally similar, as the alternatives in both cases are defined as the possible outcomes (all directions or all colours). A fundamental aspect of decision alternatives, as we characterize them, is their mutual exclusion: a decision is about singling out exactly one alternative, which makes the set of all possible alternatives mutually exclusive by definition.</p><p>Decision-making is closely related to the notion of psychological agency. In analysing the evolution of agency, Tomasello <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> defines it as a flexible goal-directed behaviour, and remarks that in order to have agency an "individual must be capable of choosing to act or not to act, or among multiple possible actions, according to its continuous perceptual assessment" <ref type="bibr">(Tomasello, 2022, p. 27</ref>).</p><p>Tomasello identifies the most rudimentary form of agency in early vertebrates, and sets aside other goal directed phenomena, such as those observed in bees, as convergent evolution. We are sympathetic to the idea that decision-making is fundamental to agency, and here we aim to clarify the role of choice between mutually exclusive alternatives, and highlight the biological foundations that had to evolve to support such alternatives (and thus also agency). We suggest that the major evolutionary steps in the evolution of choice emerged much earlier than the abilities Tomasello addresses, possibly coinciding with the appearance of a central nervous systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alternatives in natural decisions</head><p>Decisions are not limited to creatures that are equipped with nervous systems, and not even to biological entities <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> . For example, consider a bi-metallic thermostat ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref>). This device is built by bonding together two pieces of metals with different expansion rates; changes in temperature cause the bi-metallic bundle to bend and close (or open) an electric circuit. The extent of bending of the metal pieces is continuous, but their installation in an electric circuit creates two discrete states: an open and a closed circuit. Thus, according to our working definition, this device "makes a choice" between two mutually exclusive alternatives. From the perspective of the human engineer, the device makes a choice about the question of whether a certain temperature threshold has been crossed. There are two alternatives for the installed thermostat -an open or a closed circuit -that are enforced by the physical construction of the device. The evaluation mechanism is the response of the metallic bands to temperature, and the judgment procedure is the actual closing (or opening) of the circuit.</p><p>In the biological domain, perhaps the most elemental, and probably the most common, version of a choice-like phenomenon is the conformational change of proteins <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2B</ref>). This biochemical process of alteration between stable forms serves as a switch in many fundamental biological processes. When it comes as a response to an environmental factor (e.g., a ligand binding), it can be viewed as a case of direct top-down causation, and thus as an elementary "decision". In this case, similarly to the thermostat, the alternatives are provided by the physical structure -the various stable conformations of the protein. When several such processes are organised together, a more complex decision process can emerge. For example, consider the lac-operon mechanism in certain prokaryotes <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2C)</ref>. This system enables the cell to navigate the processing of different sugar sources, according to their availability, by expressing the genes responsible for lactose digestion only in the presence of lactose and the absence of glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . A simplified model has demonstrated these dynamics as a decisionmaking system that can be simulated by the Boolean AND-NOT operation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . Notably, these decisions are based on stochastic processes and selective stabilization.</p><p>Still, decision-making terminology commonly revolves around behaviours of creatures with nervous systems. One of the most rudimentary forms of biological neural organization can be found in Cnidaria (jellyfish, corals, and relatives). Members of the genus Hydra, for instance, possess a distributed nervous system, with no "brain" or central ganglia <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> , and exhibit a variety of different behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . One simple behaviour is the contraction or elongation of its tubular body, often as a response to external stimuli such as mechanical touch or light <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . This behaviour, regardless of the sensory inputs that may affect its occurrence, is a matter of alteration between two mutually exclusive alternatives -contraction and elongation -and thus an instance of decision. The evaluation method may require an integration of sensory inputs and internal states <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> , and the judgement procedure involves the response of the muscles to these inputs and to the diffused neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . The alternatives, in this case, can be viewed as forced by the physical body that cannot be contracted and elongated at the same time. However, some mechanism that would prevent the muscles from attempting to simultaneously perform contradictory behaviours could be energetically beneficial. Indeed, a model of Hydra's biomechanical structure suggests that differences in muscle response profiles provide this necessary coordination <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2D)</ref>.</p><p>A simple example of low-level decisions in vertebrates can be found in the flexor and extensor muscles, that control the movement of the joints ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2E)</ref>. To bend or extend a limb, one of these muscles must be contracted (while the other is elongated). This calls, again, for a form of elemental decision: the selection of one out of two alternatives, i.e., contracting one muscle or the other (and not both). Here, the alternatives could have been provided by the skeleton anatomy (which is external to the neural decision system), yet an internal mechanism that would synchronize the alternatives' mutual exclusion would be highly beneficial, and indeed present even in the peripheral nervous system (as will be explained below).</p><p>Decisions are not limited to behavioural outputs. In fact, our conscious life appears to involve endless "internal" decisions. We will elaborate on this perspective below, but for now, consider for example the Necker cube 17 as a simple perceptual decision process <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 2F</ref>). The brain decides the orientation of the cube, and it chooses between one of two alternatives. You may verify, by staring at <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2F</ref> for a few seconds, that the brain may alternate between the options, but cannot choose both simultaneously (it might choose something else, such as seeing the image in two dimensions and not as a cube). This is to remind us that most of our daily use of the term "decision-making" actually refers to internal decisions, in which the evaluations, judgments, and alternatives are all operated by, or mentally represented in, the brain. Necker's cube.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The evolution of alternatives Evolutionary building blocks of mutual exclusion</head><p>We suggest that the evolution of cognition involved the adaptation of the possible space of alternatives, which we refer to as the decision space, to support complex decisions. This evolutionary route involved five major transitions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3)</ref>. First, in the non-neural phase of decision making, e.g., as appears in bacteria, the decision space is enforced solely by the environment, the structure of the mechanism, and by the effects of the output: a conformational change of a protein is constrained by its structure (and specifically its stable conformations), the operation of the lac-operon is constrained by the possible positions and availability of the repressors, the movement of a bacteria is constrained by the possible orientations of its flagella <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3A)</ref>.</p><p>In a second phase, neurons, or neuron-like cells, that might have evolved due to their advantage in providing tuneable evaluation and judgement mechanisms, e.g., by flexible synaptic connections, altered the direct link between the environmental constraints and the set of alternatives. For instance, the Cnidarian Aglantha, a small hydrozoan jellyfish, demonstrates two distinct types of movement, slow swimming and escape response. Interestingly, both behaviours are induced by the same neurons, which can propagate action potentials using a flow of either calcium or sodium ions (but not both)the first induces slow swimming and the second an escape response <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref> . Thus, the mutual exclusion in this case is provided by chemical processes in Aglantha neurons. In Hydra, as mentioned above, mutual exclusive behaviours, at least partially, rely on calcium-response profiles of different muscles <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3B</ref>). The appearance of neuronal networks, and specifically the evolution of inhibitory neurons, however, laid the ground for the third phase of cognitive evolution.</p><p>The third phase resulted from the appearance of mutual exclusion by neural organization <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3C</ref>).</p><p>These organizations generate decision spaces which are not directly attached to the physical environment. For instance, a model of the mutual inhibition of motor neurons in the flexor-extensor mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> implies that the two alternatives (flexing or extending) are constrained -i.e., enforced to be mutually exclusive -by peripheral neural organization of mutual inhibition, and not solely by the physical inability of the two opposing muscles to contract simultaneously. Similar mechanisms can be found in movement control of C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> , and Drosophila larvae <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref>   <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig.   3D</ref>). The fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster, for instance, can learn to approach a rewarding odour and to avoid an aversive one (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref> ). Notably, neurobiological assays suggested that separate systems in the fly brain encode decisions regarding odour attractiveness and decisions regarding appropriate movements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref> ). Furthermore, conflicts regarding innate and learned odour attractiveness were suggested to be resolved in the brain upstream of the final decision regarding the required movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25</ref> . These observations demonstrate flexible internal mechanisms of decision-making, i.e., flexibly providing effective sets of alternatives. In other cases, we may have a reasonable suspicion that such classification occurs. For instance, when a free walking fruit-fly comes across a chasm, it performs a stereotypic crossing-climbing behaviour. However, it only initiates this manoeuvre after visually estimating the gap width <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26</ref> . In this instance of decision-making, the fly appears to both decide the width, where its alternatives are either (hypothetically) all possible widths or only a binary set of options (i.e., crossable/uncrossable), and decide on the proper leg movements, with alternatives as sets (or sequences) of actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27</ref> .</p><p>Putatively, a fifth phase of this evolutionary trajectory involved the detachment of certain decision processes from even the internal (brain) sensorimotor circuits <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 3E)</ref>, giving rise to imagination and counterfactual reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> , although we cannot be certain that such processes were not already present in the fourth phase. In these cases, we may have more than a reasonable suspicion that internal classification occurs. For example, when we (humans) decide between eating the red and the green apple, our set of alternatives is enormous -we can decide to eat anything that comes to mind, or maybe even to perform other actions, even if the most probable decision would be to eat either of the two apples. However, when perceiving the red apple, we were already involved in several decisionmaking processes: e.g., we chose 'red' as its colour, out of all possible colours. We say that choosing the colour was a decision since we can only consciously perceive it as a single instance of the set of all colours (those which can be generated and be treated as colours by our brain, and not necessarily those familiar to us). This is an act of classification, and in fact, choosing an apple probably encompasses several classification processes, i.e., decisions: it is red, it is an apple, it is reachable, etc.</p><p>It is worth noting that classification or categorization can also provide discretization, when a decision process takes a continuous input and outputs a specific category. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The evolution of constraints internalization</head><p>At which point, temporally or anatomically, does choice take place? Where is the location in which one alternative is being chosen over the others along the axis of input (sensory) -output (behaviour)?</p><p>In simple mechanisms, the decision only occurs at the output: in the case of the thermostat, there are two mutually exclusive physically stable states, and the decision is the transition to one state or the other, thereby also opening or closing the electrical circuit; a subcellular decision to open or close a transmembrane channel may happen when the channel changes its conformation; and the decision of the lac operon occurs when the relevant gene is expressed. In such cases, the decision is a result of a cascade of earlier processes, but only at the point of decision a strict choice between alternatives is performed. Accordingly, the set of alternatives is defined by the constraints of the output, e.g., the two states of the electrical circuit, or the two conformations of the transmembrane protein.</p><p>When information is transmitted from input to output by a network of neurons, a mechanism that enforces the mutual exclusion of contradicting behaviours may evolve -i.e., an internal choice mechanism. For instance, in the flexor-extensor system, mutual inhibition between the corresponding motor neurons provides the necessary mutual exclusion and prevents possible inefficient (and deleterious) behaviour of attempting to contract the two muscles simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref> . Thus, the appearance of networks of neurons facilitates the relocation of decision along the information processing stream. This might be aided, evolutionarily, by the fact that internal neurons can share mechanical aspects with sensory and motor neurons (i.e., they are all neurons). Evolved mechanisms that constrain simultaneous activation of some output neurons, such as those stimulating the flexor and extensor muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref> or those controlling simple forms of locomotion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> , can potentially serve as an exaptation, or preadaptation, to a choice-constraining mechanism that is not directly attached to the output. Furthermore, the relocation of decision can be viewed as an evolutionary hierarchical construction: fundamental mechanisms that enforce mutual exclusion become building blocks for more complex combinatorial sets of alternatives -for example, a collection of ion channels serves as a combinatorial switch for a neuron, or various combinations of mutual-inhibition neural circuits serve as a set of alternatives for increasingly sophisticated decisions.</p><p>When decisions are made internally, complex behaviour evolves. For instance, both elementary and elaborate planning rely on decisions: turn left or right, fight or flight, forage or find shelter, walk around the hill or across the river. These types of "either-or" decisions also encapsulate mutual inhibition of alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . When one behaviour is selected, it necessarily inhibits the alternative behaviours, although unchosen alternatives could still be processed and remain at hand for rapid switching. The essence of such a switch (e.g., 'fight' was chosen but the opponent has proved stronger than expected) is the reversal of the inhibition. More broadly, animals are capable of simulating alternative behaviours and evaluating their expected outcomes, in what Tomasello considers as an "executive decision-making" that serves as a basis for mammalian agency <ref type="bibr">(Tomasello, 2022, p. 51)</ref>.</p><p>This type of decision-making, which requires the integration of sensory-inputs and proprioceptionsimulations, evaluates specific alternatives, where the set of all possible alternatives, in this case, is probably constructed by experience -e.g., when an animal considers different routes to a food source <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref> .</p><p>Thus, we hypothesize that a possible evolutionary path that shaped decision-making processes might have involved the internalization of the constraints: in decision tasks in which alternatives were enforced by the peripheral body (i.e., directly bound to behavioural output such as controlling movement or chemical secretion), internal decision would have been adaptive. When peripheral neuronal mechanisms were involved (e.g., in mutual inhibition as in the flexor-extensor model), these mechanisms could have been 'reused' as part of a central nervous system to create internal constraints on the alternative set of specific decisions. This process could have taken place in several ways. First, each decision, or behaviour, may be controlled by an anatomically separated system, such as in the Cnidarian non-overlapping neural networks that are responsible for different behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . Then, such separation might be exhibited in modularity of a central nervous system, where each module could potentially be responsible for specific decisions. However, such innate structures may not suffice to support all of the cognitive abilities of some species, especially in the context of learned responses and behaviours. In human decision-making, high-level of flexibility might be required, since experience shapes not only decisions' outcomes, but also the formulation of the problems (see phase 5 above).</p><p>As noted above in relation to the lac-operon, the discrete essence of alternatives can easily result from stochastic processes, and such processes are expected also in the dynamic scales of a central nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref> . An appealing analogy to such a stochastic process might be the decision-making in a swarm of bees <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref> , e.g. when looking for a nesting site <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">33</ref> : out of thousands of bees, only a few hundred scouts actively search for nest-sites. When a scout finds one, she directs other scouts to the site using the famous waggle dance, being more enthusiastic when she evaluates the site as better. When a suitable site is found, the resulting dynamics creates a snowball effect (as more and more scouts visit the site and engage in persuading others to join), and when a certain number of dances are performed in the swarm -the entire swarm moves to the designated location. This is an example of a decision that is made by the interaction of independent individual units, where the alternatives are discovered by the units during the decision process. Another analogy from the eusocial insect world can be drawn from ants that discover the shortest path between their nest and a food source: individual forager ants stochastically search for food and leave pheromone markers on their path, to attract other ants -the shortest paths tend to accumulate thicker markers, as the foragers return on the same routes (doubling the markers faster in short paths than in longer ones), creating a snowball effect by attracting more ants that accelerate the marking process <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34</ref> . We favour the hypothesis that some decisions in the brain might work in a similar way <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35</ref> , where populations of neurons compete to form stable alternativesthose which can affect downstream processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implications for computational cognitive models</head><p>Internal decision-making between competing alternatives, which are mentally represented in the brain, or between possible states, or configurations, of brain activities involves a process of selection. A selection process need not necessarily consist of a dedicated structure or element, but rather a way of operation that results in a selective behaviour. Most cognitive models of decision-making assume the existence of such a mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37</ref> , be it Bayesian models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39</ref> ), connectionist models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40</ref> ), or abstract models of associative learning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">41</ref> ).</p><p>These models deal with the problem of why specific alternatives are being chosen over others, thus they assume that there is some mechanism for choosing. In other words, they handle the problem of evaluation. However, these models are not concerned with the selective procedure or choice, i.e., the way in which the possible alternatives are being 'presented' to the selection procedure. As we mentioned earlier, an explicit representation of the alternatives prior to the selection process is in general not required <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Fig. 1)</ref>. To illustrate the point, consider a connectionist or a Bayesian model that describes how an accumulated sensory experience is translated to a probability distribution over a set of behaviours, e.g., choosing a direction of movement, or selecting a word to articulate. Such a model is understood as being embedded in a context that addresses two surrounding questions. First, how a specific behaviour ends up being carried out by the organism. Second, how the set of alternatives (e.g., possible directions or words) comes into being, in particular as a set of mutually exclusive alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42</ref> .</p><p>Intriguing findings from research into sub-circuits of large language models (LLMs) suggest that, in some cases, the decision can be tracked down to specific internal nodes. In these instances, upstream layers to those nodes exhibit unstructured phenomena while downstream layers represent the decided answer <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">43</ref> . Interestingly, one of the offered mechanisms for those internal decisions is based on specific inhibition of alternative choices.</p><p>Some attention has been given to the way in which the brain generates a set of options to choose from, as a first step in a decision-making procedure (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Gettys, Pliske, Manning, &amp; Casey, 1987</ref>).</p><p>These studies investigated the impact of the sequential order of generated options <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">45</ref> , the effects of memory-related and other cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46</ref> , the influence of cached-values of different options <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">47</ref> , and the possible biological and social factors affecting the creation of options <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">48</ref> . However, these treatments ultimately deal with narrowing down the possible options, sometimes termed the 'consideration set', from a potentially very large or even infinite choice space, but the origin of this source set remains elusive.</p><p>Mechanistic models that describe the existence, or learning, of alternatives often belong to the family of "attractor" models (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">50 )</ref>, in which the dynamics of a distributed or continuous model (e.g., a network) include discrete stable states (attractors). These states may correspond to memories of learned experiences, innate categories, learned distinctions, and so on. Furthermore, such models can be associative and might even be learned in a Hebbian-like manner (e.g. a Hopfield network <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">51</ref> ). In such models the choice or selection is being (and remaining) in an attractor state. The larger system that encompasses such a process may need to be able to recognise that this stabilization has occurred, and to be able to restart the process when the mechanism is needed again. Changing the set of alternatives implies a change in the organization of the network (in a way that maintains the architecture that gives rise to appropriate attractor states).</p><p>Attempts to illustrate the emergence of complex properties from rudimentary elements (e.g., Hebbianlike learning), lean on fundamental operations of the brain, such as associative learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[54]</ref> . Yet, associative learning by itself does not suffice to explain choice. Associative learning essentially reflects the statistics of experiences. However, while statistical reflection of the world can support the evaluation of alternatives in a decision task, it cannot generate the task itself, and specifically, cannot line up the alternatives themselves as mutually exclusive alternatives to choose from. Note, that we are referring to the mere fact that a (single) alternative ends up being selected from a learned set. In simple cases, such as go/no-go tasks, associative learning ends up with a single learned outcome, and we leave open the question of whether the choice between action and inaction requires a mutual exclusion mechanism.</p><p>We thus suggest that a model of the fundamental aspects of the brain requires some treatment of framing alternatives. We advocate for computational cognitive models that directly handle the question of how sets of alternatives are constructed -evolutionarily, or developmentally -by considering the appearance of mutually exclusive alternatives in the cognitive system. The discussion in previous sections illustrated some of the major ways in which this may be implemented in biological systems, and hypothesized about the order in which they appeared in evolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>Much attention has been given to possible steps in the evolution of cognition, or the brain itself (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[57]</ref> ). Commonly, the question at hand is the evolutionary route that has led to the appearance of sophisticated behaviours, such as navigation, planning, language, social tendencies, and also processes of decision-making. Here we have suggested that a core question in cognitive evolution revolves around the foundations of the decision process itself. Specifically, considering three aspects of decision-making: alternatives, evaluation, and judgement, we postulate that evolutionary and computational theories have mostly only dealt with the latter two (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">58</ref> ). Yet, the neglected part -of constructing the alternatives, as mutually exclusive alternatives and the evolution of processes that ensure that only a single one of a set of alternatives is active, sheds interesting light on brain and cognitive evolution. In short, to establish a decision mechanism, a system of mutual exclusion must evolve. We suggest that a possible route for this evolutionary process begins with alternatives that are forced by the environment, or physical bodies. A detachment from this enforcement is supported by the appearance of neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">59</ref> , although other evolved mechanisms also serve the same purpose (e.g., the differential response profiles of muscles in Hydra) . When peripheral neurons are responsible for constraining the decision space, a possible evolutionary advancement would have been the constraint internalization, in which these neuronal structures became part of a central nervous system.</p><p>Thus, we postulate that a major benefit of a central nervous system was the separation of the constraints (that shape the alternatives) from the physical environment. Internal constraint mechanisms pave the way for sequential internal decisions and cognitive processes such as planning.</p><p>The detachment of the alternatives from the environment, including the body, may induce slower evaluation, but the judgment process (or the selection itself) could become faster. Furthermore, such organization allows the alternatives to enjoy some major benefits of the nervous system -its combinatorics (enabling the integration of various inputs), and its flexibility (making the decision spaces learnable). We hope to encourage the development of fundamental computational models of decision-making that directly handle the formation of sets of alternatives and mutually exclusive choice.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Specification of decision-making. The decision process is an evaluation of alternatives and a judgment procedure that results in a choice of a single alternative. This process is constrained to evaluate a set of mutually exclusive alternatives -finite or infinite, discrete or continuous. In this example of a perceptual decision, the alternatives are constrained to include colours, but not 'apple' or 'run'. These constraints, which define the exclusivity of the alternatives, are the focus of our discussion.</figDesc></figure>

Different types of decision, or decision-like, phenomena: A) bi-metallic thermostat; B) a transmembrane ion-channel; C) the lac-operon; D) the movement of Hydra; E) the flexor-extensor system controlling the movement of a joint; F)</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>. The fourth phase in the evolution of decision spaces involves the appearance of central nervous systems (CNS). In central nervous systems, configurations of joint activity of neurons correspond to sensory inputs, behavioural outputs, or internal states. This paves the way to both integrative and combinatorial representation of alternatives. Integrative representation means that several input sources (e.g., visual and tactile sensors) participate in creating patterns of activation which are relevant to a specific instance of decision. The neuronal network structure enables the detachment of the activations underlying a chosen alternative from the input and output mechanisms (e.g., from sensory or motor neurons). This detachment has enormous consequences for decision making possibilities: first, the size of the sets of alternatives expands dramatically, since instead of an alternative being limited to a collection of input or output neuron activations, alternatives become all the subsets of these collections, enabling a more precise decision-making. Second, this organization is highly flexible and can support learning of new alternatives or even of new sets of alternatives</figDesc></figure>

Top: Examples of biological decisions related to the different phases. Bottom: Examples of physical mechanisms enforcing mutual exclusion of alternatives. A) Alternatives are enforced by the environment, or the body; analogous to a bi-metallic thermostat's operation. B) Specific body parts, including neurons, acquire the capacity to enforce mutual exclusion of alternatives; this is exemplified by how different calcium-response profiles in ectodermal and endodermal muscles create two alternatives: elongation and contraction of the Hydra's peduncle. C) Neuronal circuits form independent sets of alternatives through mechanisms such as mutual inhibition of motor neurons. D) A central nervous system forms internal flexible sets of alternatives. E) Internal decisions can be arranged sequentially or hierarchically and enable complex behaviour such as planning.</figDesc></figure>
