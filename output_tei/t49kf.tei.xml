			<abstract>
				<p>Perception and decision-making are two cognitive processes that are strongly interrelated but that are rarely studied in a unified framework. When decisions concern time-related attributes, a proper understanding of the influence of time perception is critical to disentangle the role of these two cognitive processes on individuals&apos; choices. This paper reports a lab experiment with university students from London, United Kingdom, and Santiago, Chile to study the impact of time perception on their route choices in a transportation system. A major novelty in the experimental design is the inclusion of an experimental condition where participants must rely on their perception of the time attributes of animated bus trips to choose their preferred bus route. Subsequently, a numerical condition presents the attributes of the same bus routes with numbers, which serves as a baseline for interpreting the impact of time perception on route choice decisions. By leveraging psychophysical principles of time perception and a discrete choice modeling framework, we formulate behavioral models that integrate choice data gathered from the animated and numerical conditions. These models incorporate psychophysical functions to capture the ability of participants to perceive the time attributes of the available bus routes. Our results show that (i) the effect of time perception on route choice decisions is robust across countries ii) the participants&apos; preferences for waiting and in-vehicle time can be properly recovered if the effect of time perception is controlled for. This evidence should help to produce a unified account of the interrelationship between time perception and decision-making about time.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>When presented with a choice of taking a regular bus service with (i) longer travel time but shorter waiting, or (ii) waiting another five minutes for an express bus service that gets you home earlier, which would you choose? Suppose that you prefer the second route because of its shorter overall journey time. Consider now a thought experiment where you are asked to use both routes and to write down the waiting and travel time you perceived in each route. Then, based on your records, the first route becomes the route with the shortest overall perceived journey time despite the fact of having the largest objective journey time. After seeing your records, would you change your decision in order to be consistent with your perception of the journey time or would you stick to the decision of choosing the first route that minimizes your objective journey time? Daily commuting choices provide just one example of many decisions in everyday life that could be made according to the perceived attributes of a set of available alternatives. Accounting for the influence of human perception is key to predicting how changes in the objective features of the environment will impact individuals' decisions.</p><p>Psychophysical principles of perception indicate that the perceived value of an attribute is a function of the intensity of the objective stimuli associated with that attribute. Many years of psychophysical research have shown that objective and subjective values of sensory stimuli are not equal and that their relationship is typically non-linear. One example is the gap between the objective duration and the subjective durations of a stimulus that has been documented in the time perception literature and that remains an active area of study <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Zakay, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wearden et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Williams et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Behavioral models of decision-making typically assume choice rules that establish a non-linear mapping between the attribute values of a set of alternatives and the alternative chosen by a decision-maker. Examples include the discrete choice models originally developed in Economics and that are widely used in Transportation science. The attribute values of the alternatives and the preferences of decision-makers are weighted to give a latent construct named utility, which also includes a random error to account for stochastic components underlying the choice process. Then, utilities are mapped into choice probabilities following a logistic choice rule. A standard assumption made in decision-making models is that the value of the objective and perceived attributes are the same. In the light of physical principles, it is reasonable to challenge the validity of the assumption and to aim to understand its impact on the correct recovery of individuals' preferences via the estimation of behavioral models.</p><p>Although research on time perception and research on decision-making are both well-developed, few studies have attempted to associate these two cognitive processes in a systematic way <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Wittmann and Paulus, 2008)</ref>. Also, despite the ubiquitous influence of time perception on time-related decisions, the vast majority of decisionmaking research has exposed participants to decision scenarios where time attributes are described using numerical quantities only. One example is provided by studies of intertemporal choice in which participants trade off money and time but in which both attributes are provided in numerical format <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Doyle, 2013)</ref>. More generally, in research on economic choice, the role of perception remains largely unexplored despite it being a key component of the decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(McFadden, 2001)</ref>.</p><p>The main goal of the present study is to disentangle the effect of time perception on decision-making about time. For this purpose, we conducted an experiment to examine the impact of time perception on route choice decisions. A novel feature of the experimental design was the inclusion of an experimental condition in which participants had to rely on their perception of the time attributes of animated bus journeys to choose their preferred bus route. Subsequently, in a numerical condition, they were presented with the attributes of the same bus routes in numerical format; this served as a baseline for understanding the impact of time perception on route choice decisions. Using psychophysical principles of time perception and a discrete choice modeling framework, we formulated behavioral models that integrated choice data gathered from the animated and numerical conditions and that captured the effect of time perception in terms of psychophysical functions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Participants</head><p>Seventy-two participants (M age = 23.31; 50% female) were a) recruited from the University College London (UCL) Psychology Participants Pool (50% of the total sample), and b) contacted via an email list owned by the Engineering Department at Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (PUC). The selection of participants was restricted to current undergraduate (64%) or graduate students (36%). The study was advertised as lasting for 40-45 minutes. Participants received a £5 fixed payment based on the minimum rate of £7.5 hour required at UCL SONA (M duration = 39.17 <ref type="bibr">[min]</ref>; SD duration = 7.25 [min]).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Tasks and materials</head><p>During the first part of the experiment, participants experienced bus journeys in a virtual environment 1 . In order to increase the engagement of the participants with the experimental task, the animations represented the main steps of a typical bus trip in public transport: 1. A person walks from an origin location to one of the nearby bus stops. 2. The person waits at the bus stop. 3. A bus arrives at the bus stop. 4. The person boards the bus 5. The bus travels between two bus stops. 6. The person gets off the bus at the next stop. 7. The person walks to a destination location.</p><p>An abstract representation of the layout of the transportation network is shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. The set of nodes {S r 1 ,L 1 , S r 1 ,L 2 , S r 2 ,L 1 , S r 2 ,L 2 } represents the four bus stops shown in the virtual network. L 1 and L 2 represent the origin and destination locations of the trips, which were randomly assigned across the decision scenarios. For instance, in the first decision scenario a trip could start from L 1 and could finish at L 2 , whereas in the next decision scenario, a trip might depart either from L 1 or L 2 . Each bus route visited two stops located at either the north (S r 1 ,L 1 and S r 1 ,L 2 ) or south (S r 2 ,L 1 and S r 2 ,L 2 ) sides of the map. The routes were also distinguished by their color (red or blue), which as randomly assigned before starting each scenario 2 . The average and variance of the time attributes of the two bus routes were manipulated across 14 decision scenarios. Every other attribute of the bus routes except for in-vehicle and waiting times remained constant across decision scenarios, e.g. the total walking time in the animated trips was always equal to four seconds. The scenarios were grouped into three blocks and the order in <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The computer experiment is implemented in Python and the code is available in the following repository: https://github.com/ pabloguarda/route-choice-experiment <ref type="bibr">2</ref> The randomization of colors is relevant as there is evidence that the color of the visual stimuli has a significant impact on time perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Thönes et al., 2018)</ref> which they appeared was randomly assigned within each block.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L 1 S r 1 ,L 1 S r 1 ,L2 S r2,L 1 S r2,L2</formula><p>The training block consisted of scenarios S 1 and S 2 . Each scenario included one route that was preferable to the other route by a threshold of two seconds in either waiting or travel time. With this manipulation, we checked whether participants had correctly perceived differences in waiting and in-vehicle times between routes. A key challenge in designing these decision scenarios was to set time differences between the bus routes that could be noticeable to participants. After conducting a pilot experiment, we found that differences of two seconds were appropriate.</p><p>The six scenarios included in block 1 (S 3 − S 8 ) manipulated the amount of waiting and in-vehicle times of each route. Scenarios S 3 and S 4 fix the overall journey time of each route at 10 seconds whereas the other four scenarios (S 5 − S 8 ) presented routes with different journey times. Block 2 included six decision scenarios (S 9 − S 14 ) that manipulated the level of variability of waiting and in-vehicle times but that fixed the same average waiting and in-vehicle times for all routes to 4 and 6 seconds, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Design and procedure</head><p>The experimental design was a 2 (between-participants conditions: control or treatment) x 2 (within-participants conditions: animated choices or numeric choices) factorial experiment. All participants started with the animated choices and went on to make the numerical choices. Before starting the experiment, they were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. Each condition defined the degree of information (control/treatment: Unknown/known waiting time) and the information format (control/treatment: prospects/tables) used to show the time attributes of the bus routes during the animated and numerical choices.</p><p>Animated choices. Each decision scenario consisted of four stages 3 :</p><p>1. Learning stage: Participants watched a single journey over two bus routes in order to learn about their waiting and in-vehicle times. By the end of this stage, participants had experienced the same number of trips in each route (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2a</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Decision stage:</head><p>Participants were asked to choose their preferred bus route according to what they experienced in the learning stage. They were also offered the option of returning to the learning stage to watch additional journeys over each route (see <ref type="bibr">Figure 2b</ref>).</p><p>3 A video of a sample trip of the experiment is found at https:// github.com/pabloguarda/route-choice-experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Consequential stage:</head><p>Participants experienced one journey in the bus route chosen in the decision stage (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2c</ref>). 4. Confirmation stage: Participants were asked how certain they felt about the choice that they had made in the decision stage. To answer this question, they had to consider the journeys that they had experienced in the consequential stage (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2d</ref>).</p><p>The level of information provided about the waiting times was different depending on the betweenparticipants condition. In the control condition, no information about the waiting (and in-vehicle) time of the bus routes was provided. Thus, participants had to rely solely on their perception of waiting and in-vehicle times in order to make a route choice (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3a</ref>). In the treatment condition, the value of the waiting time is displayed in a time counter located above the first stop visited by the bus route (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3b</ref>).  Numerical choices. The second part of the experiment displayed the time attributes of the routes in a numerical format. The magnitudes of the waiting and in-vehicle times were identical to those used in the animated bus journeys, except the units were in minutes. For instance, a route that had four seconds of waiting time and six seconds of in-vehicle time in the animated condition was presented  as a route with four minutes of waiting time and six minutes of in-vehicle time in the numeric condition. The order of the decision scenarios was again randomized to ensure participants did not suspect any similarity between the attributes of the bus routes shown in the animated and numerical conditions.</p><p>Depending on the between-participants condition, the time attributes of the routes were shown in one of two numeric formats (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4</ref>). In the control condition, the time attributes of the routes were shown as prospects <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Abdellaoui et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ashby and Gonzalez, 2017)</ref>. For routes with time variability, two squared boxes are used to represent one of its two possible time outcomes, and the probabilities of the time outcomes are set at 50%. For routes with no variability in waiting and in-vehicle times, the probabilities of the prospects are set at 100% and the two temporal outcomes are the same (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4a</ref>).</p><p>In the treatment condition, the attributes of the bus routes are described with a table that shows the waiting and in-vehicle times of two bus trips (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 4b</ref>). For routes with no variability in waiting and in-vehicle times, the values of the time attributes did not change between bus journeys. For routes with time variability, each bus journey represented one of two possible time outcomes for the bus route.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experimental results</head><p>Here, we report only the choice data collected within the eight scenarios shown in the training block and in block I. These scenarios manipulated only the average value of the time attributes of the bus routes. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> summarizes the values of the time attributes of the pair of bus routes shown in each of these scenarios. Routes are grouped in two columns such that routes 1 and 2 represent the routes with the lowest and highest amount of waiting time within each decision scenario, respectively. The only exception is scenario S 2 where route 1 is the route with the shortest in-vehicle time. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5</ref> shows the choice proportions obtained in the animated and numerical conditions after pooling the choice data gathered from the two between-participants conditions. For each scenario, the null hypothesis represents an even split of route choices between bus routes. The dashed lines represent the thresholds of a chi-square test conducted at the 95% confidence level and with one degree of freedom. Graphically, the null hypothesis is rejected when the choice proportions are outside the region bounded by the two dashed lines. This suggests that participants either do not choose at random or have a clear preference for one of the two bus routes.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Analysis of choice proportions between groups of decision scenarios</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1.">Multiple testing</head><p>As more hypothesis tests are conducted, there is a higher likelihood of falsely rejecting one of the null hypotheses. To control for the natural inflation of the type I error within multiple testing, the significance level for each hypothesis was corrected for the family-wise error rate (FWER). This correction results in lower values of significance levels and, thus, a larger proportion of null hypotheses tending to be rejected. Bonferroni correction is a standard procedure used in social sciences to control for the FWER in the presence of multiple dependent hypotheses. In our experiment, dependency arises due to the existence of choice responses that are gathered from the same participant. A main drawback of methods that control for the FWER is that they tend to inflate the false negative rate or type II error. To overcome this problem, researchers recommend controlling for the false discovery rate (FDR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Glickman et al., 2014)</ref>. These procedures have been shown to generate gains in statistical power relative to methods based on the FWER. A standard method is the Benjamini-Hochberg approach where (i) the hypothesis are increasingly ordered according to their p-value and (ii) the significance level of a single hypothesis is set as α = k/mβ, with k the position of each hypothesis defined in (i) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2.">Manipulation checks (S 1 &amp; S 2 )</head><p>To check whether participants were choosing alternatives randomly, we examined the choice proportions of the two scenarios included in the training block. Both scenarios included a dominating option, namely, a bus route that had either a shorter waiting time (S 1 ) or a shorter invehicle time (S 2 ). Note that for subsequent analyses, we include choice data gathered from individuals who failed to pass the manipulation check because their choices were still informative about the association between decisionmaking and time perception.</p><p>Choosing the dominating option in the animated choices is complex because participants made decisions based on perceived attributes. Despite that, differences in preferences between the dominating and dominated alternatives in both scenarios are positive and significant (S 1 : 87.5% vs. 12.5%, χ 2 = 40.5, p &lt; .001; S 2 : 69.4% vs. 30.6%, χ 2 = 10.9, p &lt; .01). Similarly, in the numerical choices, we observe significant and positive differences in preferences between the dominating and dominated alternatives in both scenarios and in both between-participants conditions (S 1 : 98.6% vs. 1.4%, χ 2 = 68.1, p &lt; .001; S 2 : 97.2% vs. 2.8%, χ 2 = 64.2, p &lt; .001). Furthermore, the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing rejects the null hypotheses in both the animated and numerical choices, with a significance level equal to 0.025 for every single hypothesis <ref type="bibr">4</ref> .</p><p>Overall, this evidence shows that the dominating option was preferred regardless of the experimental condition. It also rules out the possibility that participants were either choosing at random or indifferent to the attribute values of the alternatives. Likewise, the large increase in the number of participants who failed to identify the most convenient route in the training block of the animated choices relative to the numerical choices suggests that time perception has an impact on route choice decisions. </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">T S 1 4 6 w 4 v 6 6 6 w 6 v 6</formula><p>Lower waiting time and equal in-vehicle time</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">T S 2 6 4 w 6 v 4 6 6 w 6 v 6</formula><p>Lower in-vehicle time and equal waiting time</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">1 S 3 4 6 w 4 v 6 6 4 w 6 v 4</formula><p>Lower proportion of waiting time and equal journey time</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">1 S 4 1 9 w 1 v 9 9 1 w 9 v 1</formula><p>Lower proportion of waiting time and equal journey time</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">1 S 5 2 9 w 2 v 9 8 2 w 8 v 2</formula><p>Much lower proportion of waiting time compensate longer journey time</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">1 S 6 3 8 w 3 v 8 8 2 w 8 v 2</formula><p>Lower proportion of waiting time compensate longer journey time</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">1 S 7 2 8 w 2 v 8 8 1 w 8 v 1</formula><p>Much lower proportion of waiting time compensate longer journey time </p><formula xml:id="formula_8">1 S 8 2 8 w 2 v 8 7 2 w 7 v 2</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3.">Aversion to waiting time (S 3 &amp; S 4 )</head><p>Travel behavior studies worldwide have systematically found that individuals prefer to reduce their waiting time to their in-vehicle time. We refer to this phenomenon as aversion to waiting time. In an attempt to replicate these findings, scenarios S 3 and S 4 show routes with the same overall journey time but with different proportions of waiting time. Thus, a rejection of the null hypothesis implies that participants were not indifferent to the proportion of waiting time on a bus route.</p><p>As expected, we found positive and significant differences in preferences between the alternatives with shorter and longer waiting times of both scenarios in the numerical condition (S 3 : 83.3% vs. 16.7%, χ 2 = 32.0, p &lt; .001; S 4 : 81.9% vs. 18.1%, χ 2 = 29.4, p &lt; .001), which supports the presence of aversion to waiting time. In contrast, the animated condition showed no significant differences in the choice proportions of the two decision scenarios (S 3 : 61.1% vs. 38.9%, χ 2 = 3.6, p &gt; .05; S 4 : 55.6% vs. 44.4%, χ 2 = 0.9, p &gt; .1) <ref type="bibr">5</ref> . This finding suggests that participants exhibited indifference to the proportion of the waiting time when time was perceived. Given that the difference in the time attributes of the routes is always greater than two seconds, the alternative explanation that participants are choosing at random can be safely ruled out.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4.">Strength of aversion to waiting time (S 5 − S 8 )</head><p>The remaining four scenarios included a route (route 1) with a longer journey time but with a lower proportion of waiting time. We hypothesized that if the aversion of waiting time was strong enough, participants would choose the route with the longer journey time in order to wait less. As a result, the difference in choice proportions between routes 1 and 2 would be positive and the choice <ref type="bibr">5</ref> If the single hypotheses are rejected for a given a significance level α, a correction for multiple testing will also lead to rejection. Therefore, the correction reduces or maintains, in the best case, the value of α used to contrast every single hypothesis proportions should remain located within the rejection region of the chi-squared test. If the aversion to waiting time is small, participants who chose route 1 in scenarios S 3 and S 4 should shift to route 2 in scenarios S 5 − S 8 in order to reduce journey time. As a consequence, the proportion of individuals choosing the route with a lower proportion of waiting time would decrease and the null hypothesis of the chi-squared test would be rejected.</p><p>Results in the numerical condition show that the differences in preferences for the alternatives with longer (shorter) and shorter (longer) journey (waiting) times are positive but not significant (S 5 : 56.9% vs. 43.1%, χ 2 = 1.4, p &gt; .1; S 6 : 58.3% vs. 41.7%, χ 2 = 2.0, p &gt; .1; S 7 : 63.9% vs. 36.1%, χ 2 = 5.6, p &lt; .05; S 8 : 59.7% vs. 40.3%, χ 2 = 2.7, p &gt; .05), which suggests that the aversion to waiting time is not strong enough to compensate the excess of journey time of the routes with the lower waiting time. This evidence also excludes the possibility that participants used a heuristic rule that aimed only to minimize waiting or journey time. Rather, it supports two standard findings in travel behavior models (i) individuals exhibit a compensatory behavior between travel and waiting time and (ii) waiting time is weighted more than in-vehicle time in route choice decisions.</p><p>In the animated condition, the differences in choice proportions are negative and no significant in most cases (S 5 : 38.9% vs. 61.1%, χ 2 = 3.6, p &gt; .05; S 6 : 37.5% vs. 62.5%, χ 2 = 4.5, p &lt; .05; S 7 : 41.7% vs. 58.3%, χ 2 = 2.0, p &gt; .1; S 8 : 40.3% vs. 59.7%, χ 2 = 2.7, p &gt; .05). In line with the conclusions drawn from scenarios S 3 and S 4 , this evidence suggests that waiting and in-vehicle times are equally weighted if time is perceived and that time perception is again distorting the expected pattern of preferences between time attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Comparison of choice proportions between and within experimental conditions</head><p>Figures 6a and 6b show the choice proportions in the animated and numerical conditions by betweenparticipants condition. To analyze the impact of the ex-perimental manipulations on route choices, we examined the data using logistic regressions predicting route choice (coded 0 for route 2, coded 1 for route 1). A dummy variable is added to test the effect of an experimental condition on route choices. To account for the correlation of participants' responses between scenarios and within an experimental condition, we estimated a mixed-effect logistic regression. Choice data gathered from the manipulation checks (S 1 , S 2 ) was excluded from these analyses because they did not provide useful insights to compare choice proportions between and within experimental conditions.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2a</ref> was estimated with data gathered from the control condition of the animated and numerical conditions. A dummy variable for the within-participants condition (0 for numerical, 1 for animated) was added to the model to test the effect of time perception. Our results show that the odds of pick-ing the shorter waiting option in the animated condition were significantly lower than in the numerical condition (OR = 0.25, z = −5.75, p &lt; .00). This evidence again supports the finding that participants were less averse to waiting time when time was perceived. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2b</ref> shows a logistic regression estimated using the data gathered from the two between-participants conditions of the animated condition. A dummy variable for the between-participants condition (0 for unknown waiting, 1 for known waiting) was added to test the effect of revealing waiting times on route choices. While the effect of the experimental manipulation was not significant (OR = 1.60, z = 1.48, p &gt; .1), the positive sign of the parameter suggests that revealing the waiting duration slightly increases the aversion to waiting time. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2c</ref> presents a logistic regression estimated using the data gathered from the two between-participants conditions of the numerical choices. As expected, the parameter of the dummy variable for the between-participants condition (0 for prospects, 1 for tables) was not significant (OR = 1.60, z = 1.48, p &gt; .1). According to work on the description-experience gap (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hertwig and Erev, 2009)</ref>, the way in which the probability of multiple outcomes of the alternative is learned by individuals may influence their choices. However, since the decision scenarios did not manipulate the level of time variability of the attributes, i.e. there was a single outcome in each alternative, the use of prospects or tables did not influence the participants' decisions. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Debrief questions</head><p>Our experiment was conducted in two waves. The second wave was in London and it introduced additional questions about time estimation and preferences about time. These questions were added to the end of the experiment to prevent any confound between the choice responses given by participants in Santiago and London.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.1.">Stated perception of time duration</head><p>The main goal of this question is to understand whether time estimation differs across time attributes and between experimental conditions of the animated choices. Participants were asked to provide an estimate of the average waiting, in-vehicle, and walking times per bus journey during the animated condition. This procedure of collecting judgments about perceived time is an example of retrospective estimation, where participants are presented with an actual duration and asked to estimate it <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mitchell and Davis, 1987</ref>). This time estimation task is also referred to as remembered duration because participants do not know that time is being recorded and thus, perceived time must be reconstructed from memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Zakay, 1993)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref> shows the average estimates given by participants assigned to each between-participants condition. The bar plots include error bars to quantify the variability of the time estimates. For comparison purposes, bar plots of the average values of the objective time attributes of the bus routes <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 1)</ref> are also included. Note that the first error bar has no width because walking times were equal and fixed among all trips shown in the animated condition.  To assess whether participants overestimated or underestimate thed average time attributes of the bus routes, a mixed effects linear regression was fitted, using as a dependent variable the difference between the participants' average estimates of a given time attribute and the real average of that attribute <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">(Table 3)</ref>. The model includes dummy variables for the type of time attribute 6 (0 for waiting time, 1 for in-vehicle time) and for the experimental condition (0 for control, 1 for treatment). Under this model specification, the intercept represents the average estimate of waiting times in the control condition. Results showed that the intercept of the model was not significant (β = 0.055, t = 0.116, p &gt; .1), which suggests no differences between the average estimate and the real average of waiting times. This is in line with the small differences between the average of the real and estimated values of waiting time observed in the control and treatment conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 7</ref>). The parameter of the dummy variable associated with the type of time attribute was positive and significant indicating that the gap between the real and estimated time was higher for in-vehicle time than waiting time (β = 1.143, t = 2.515, p &lt; .05). The magnitude of the parameter reveals that participants overestimate in-vehicle time by more than 1 minute. Furthermore, the parameter associated with the experimental condition was not significant, which suggests no differences in time estimates when waiting time was either unknown or displayed (β = 0.055, t = 0.116, p &gt; .1). The average difference in the waiting time estimate between experimental conditions was about 100 milliseconds, which is small for the seconds scale that was used in the animated condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2.">Stated preferences for time attributes</head><p>Participants were also asked to use a scale from 0 to 100 to state the relative importance of waiting, in-vehicle, and journey times when traveling on public transport. The main goal of this question was to have a baseline to assess the preferences of participants for reducing waiting time and reducing in-vehicle time. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 8</ref> shows the average importance of each time attribute in different experimental conditions. In all cases, waiting time was considered more important than invehicle time which supports aversion to waiting time. To assess whether the difference in the importance of time attributes was significant, a mixed effects linear regression was fitted using the importance of the time attribute as the dependent variable. <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 4</ref> shows a summary of the regression results. Data on the valuation of journey time was excluded from the regression because our interest was studying the relative preference between waiting and in-vehicle time. The regression includes dummy variables for the type of time attribute (0 for waiting time, 1 for in-vehicle time) and for the experimental condition (0 for control, 1 for treatment). The intercept of the model represents the average importance of travel time in the control condition.   Results show that the parameter of the dummy variable associated with the type of time attribute was positive and significant, which confirms that participants consider waiting time more important than in-vehicle time (β = 11.5, t = 2.3, p &lt; .05). The parameter associated with the experimental condition was not significant which suggests no differences in time estimates when waiting times are unknown or revealed (β = −0.026, t = 0.0, p &gt; .1). Finally, the intercept of the model was significantly different from 0 (β = 66.833, t = 18.1, p &lt; .01), which supports the argument that travel time is a relevant attribute in travel decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Discussion</head><p>This section summarizes the main conclusions obtained from the analyses of the choice data and of the responses to the debrief questions. It also grounds our findings in the literature on time perception and travel behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1.">Internal validity</head><p>Proper randomization in the assignment of participants between experimental interventions is key to achieving internal validity. There are two results that support appropriate randomization in the assignment of participants in the experiment. First, the comparison of choice responses between experimental conditions in the numerical choices shows no difference between groups. This supports correct randomization because the experimental intervention was expected to have no effect on route choice decisions. Second, the average importance of waiting and in-vehicle times obtained from the debrief questions was not statistically different in the control and treatment conditions. Therefore, displaying information on waiting time in the experiment was unlikely to have had an influence on the importance that participants attributed to waiting and in-vehicle times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2.">Time estimation</head><p>The analysis of time estimation responses shows that participants accurately estimate waiting times but overestimate in-vehicle times. The different ability of participants to estimate the duration of stimuli in the same modality is related to the choice of visual stimulus used in the experiment to mimic the experience of traveling and waiting in public transport. The experience of waiting in the animated choices was represented with a single shot of an image showing a question mark. The feeling of movement while traveling was represented with a sequence of multiple shots of a bus image that appeared between the departure and arrival bus stops. The frame rate of the bus image used to represent a bus traveling could explain the overestimation of in-vehicle times observed in the experiment.</p><p>Psychophysical studies have shown that the characteristics of visual stimulus have a significant effect on the estimation of time duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Matthews et al., 2011)</ref>. For instance, adding a train of clicks and a higher number of discrete elements to a visual stimulus can increase judgments of stimulus duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Buffardi, 1971)</ref>. The difference between judgments of filled and empty durations is termed the filled duration illusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Thomas and Brown, 1974)</ref> and is a phenomenon that has been proven to be robust across sensory modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Williams et al., 2018)</ref>. A standard explanation is that the presence of elements that fill the duration of a sensory stimulus speeds up the pacemaker in the internal clock due to the increases in stimulus intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Matthews et al., 2011)</ref>. Thus, filled intervals are expected to increase verbal estimates of time duration relative to empty intervals <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Wearden et al., 2007)</ref>. This suggests that the filled duration illusion might vanish if we were to modify our experiment so that only two images are used to represent the departure and arrival of the bus between stops in the experiment. Some evidence from travel behavior studies suggests that our findings on time estimation are externally valid. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">González et al. (2015)</ref> found that individuals overestimated in-vehicle times when traveling by tram. Similarly, a field survey conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Parthasarathi et al. (2013)</ref> revealed that a majority of travelers overestimated their travel time and that overestimation was more likely to occur in travelers who made short trips. Evidence on the ability of individuals to estimate waiting times is less conclusive but it does not completely rule out our findings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Fan et al. (2016)</ref> found that the waiting times reported by travelers at bus stops were about 1.2 times longer than the observed waiting times. In contrast, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Millonig et al. (2012)</ref> found that passengers underestimated waiting time in train stations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3.">Effect of time duration information</head><p>Displaying waiting time duration in the animated choices showed no influence on time estimation. Evidence from previous experimental studies is not conclusive on the effect of displaying information on the estimation of duration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hui and Zhou (1996)</ref> analyzed the influence of waiting duration information on consumer reactions and found no effect of information on perceived duration. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Antonides et al. (2006)</ref> found that expected waiting time can reduce perceived waiting. A review of travel behavior studies conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dziekan and Kottenhoff (2007)</ref> showed that information on expected waiting time at stations generally reduced perceived waiting time. The same authors conducted a two-wave survey before and after the implementation of real-time information on a tram line in the Netherlands and observed that observed wait time decreased by 20% <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dziekan and Vermeulen, 2006)</ref>. The reduction in perceived waiting was attributed to the presence of travel information 7 .</p><p>Revealing waiting time information in the experiment had a positive but no significant impact on route choice decisions. The magnitude of the regression parameters revealed that, on average, the odds of choosing the route with a lower waiting time was 1.6 higher when the waiting time was revealed. In line with this result, a review of experimental and field studies conducted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Antonides et al. (2006)</ref> showed that a robust effect is observed of the negative impact of perceived waiting time on wait evaluation. An experiment conducted by the same authors found that duration information amplified the impact of perceived waiting time on wait evaluation <ref type="bibr">(An-tonides et al., 2006)</ref>. The rationale for this is that providing duration information to consumers makes them more aware that they are waiting and, as a result, they penalize waiting time more.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.4.">Preferences gap</head><p>Our results reveal a gap in the preferences for time attributes when individuals make decisions based on numbers or their perception of time duration. Results from the debrief questions support that participants exhibit aversion to waiting time in their daily transportation decisions, namely, they are willing to reduce more waiting than invehicle time. However, when participants make decisions based on perceived time duration, they exhibit no aversion to waiting time, i.e., waiting and in-vehicle are equally weighted. The absence of aversion to waiting time counters a robust finding in travel behavior studies showing that individuals penalize waiting time more than in-vehicle time.</p><p>The gap in preferences for waiting and in-vehicle time observed between the animated and numerical choices suggests that time perception can distort decision-making to the extent that choice data does not reveal the expected pattern of preferences. Thus, if the effect of time perception is not captured in decision-making models, the preferences for waiting and in-vehicle times could be not properly recovered. This assessment motivates the formulation of the behavioral model presented in the next section which accounts for the influence of time perception on decisions about time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Behavioral modeling</head><p>To account for the influence of time perception on decisions about time, we fitted a behavioral model on the participants' choice data. The traditional problem of route choice studied in travel behavior research is used as a test bed to fit the behavioral model and to contrast a series of research hypotheses. This section describes (i) the conceptual framework used to apply discrete choice analysis to our data and (ii) how the effect of time perception can be captured in the specification of a discrete choice model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Conceptual framework</head><p>Decision-making could be depicted as a cognitive process that has as input information about a set of alternatives and that has as output a decision or choice. Inside this black box, there are multiple sub-processes interacting with each other that transform the input information into a choice. In line with this representation, McFadden (2001) presents a diagram with some of the key components underlying decision-making; they include memory, perceptions and beliefs, motivation and affect, preferences and attitudes, among others. Note that experiences, information, and choice set constraints are represented as inputs to the decision-making process. Furthermore, stated perceptions, attitude scales, and stated preferences are indicators of their corresponding latent constructs.  <ref type="formula">2001</ref>Given the scope of this paper and the breadth of the data gathered from the experiment, we focus on the following components of the choice process:</p><p>Choice set constraints. A choice in a decision scenario is made on a constrained set of alternatives. Each scenario in the experiment presents a choice set of two alternative routes to travel between a certain origin and destination.</p><p>Information. The time attributes of the routes presented to participants come in the form of numbers or time durations.</p><p>Perception. A cognitive process that maps objective information about the time attributes of the bus routes into perceived values by following psychophysical laws.</p><p>Preferences. Individuals hold innate preferences for each time attribute. Preference weights quantify the impact of variations in the perceived values of the time attributes on the probability that a participant chooses an alternative in a decision scenario.</p><p>Process. In each decision scenario, participants choose the alternative route that maximizes the utility of travel. Utility is a latent construct equal to the weight between the perceived values and the preferences weights associated with the time attributes. The output of the decision process is given by a logistic choice rule that maps utilities into choice probabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Model formulation</head><p>Choice set (A). Let's define A ns as the set of the two available routes that individual n has to travel in decision scenario s ∈ S.</p><p>Latent utility (U). Let's consider an individual n in a population of size N. Utility U ni of the individual n for an alternative route i ∈ A ns can be expressed as the sum of a systematic utility term V ni and a random error term ϵ ni :</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">U ni = V ni + ϵ ni<label>(1)</label></formula><p>According to this definition, the latent utility is a random variable. If and only if the disturbances had a distribution Extreme Value (EV), then Luce's logistic rule becomes consistent with a random utility model (RUM) with independent identically distributed additive disturbances <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(McFadden, 2001</ref>).</p><p>Choice probabilities (P). In a binary case with two alternatives i, j ∈ A ns , the probabilities of choosing alternative i by individual n can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">P ni = P(U ni ≥ U nj ) = P(V ni + ε ni ≥ V nj + ε nj ) = P(ε nj − ε ni ≤ V ni − V nj ) = P(Z ≤ V ni − V nj )<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Z is a random variable equal to the difference of two random variables that are EV distributed.</p><p>Suppose that the random terms have the same variance</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">σ 2 ϵ = Π 2 6 λ 2 but different means µ k = E(ϵ k ) = η k + γ λ , ∀k ∈ {i, j}. Then, by definition, Z n = ε ni − ε nj ∼ Logistic (η, λ)</formula><p>and the choice probability P ni can be found in closed form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">P ni = F Z (V ni − V nj ) = 1 1 + e −(V ni −V nj −η)λ = e λV ni e λV ni + e λ(V nj +η)<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where F Z is the cumulative density function of a logistic distribution, η = η i − η j is the difference in means between the random terms of alternatives i and j, and λ is the shape parameter of the EV distribution which is inversely proportional to the standard deviation of the random term. Finally, if error terms are assumed to be identically distributed, E(ϵ i ) = E(ϵ j ) → η i − η j = 0, the probability formula in Eq. 3 can be reduced to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">P ni = e λV ni e λV ni + e λV nj = 1 1 + e λ(V nj −V ni )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>When the number of alternatives is greater than two, a similar but more involved derivation proves that, under the same set of assumptions, choice probabilities follow a softmax choice rule with inputs equal to the utilities of each alternative in the choice set. This gives rise to the Multinomial Logit model (MNL).</p><p>Attributes (K). Each alternative k ∈ A ns is depicted by its waiting time w k and in-vehicle time v k . Preferences (β). The preference weights for waiting and in-vehicle time are β nw and β nv respectively. β is indexed on individual n because, in the most general case, a modeler can capture a specific preference vector for individual n ∈ N.</p><p>Systematic utility (V). The systematic utility in travel behavior research is typically assumed to be a linear combination of the preference weights and the objective values of the attributes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">V ni = ∑ k∈K β k x ik = β nw w i + β nv v i (5)</formula><p>where x ik is the value of an attribute k in alternative i ∈ A ns , s ∈ S. Instead, if the deterministic utility V ni of individual n for alternative i accounts for time perception, the attributes in utility become a function of their objective values:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">V ni = ∑ k∈K β k Ψ nk (x ik ) = β nw Ψ nw (w i ) + β nv Ψ nv (v i ) (6)</formula><p>where Ψ : R → R is the perception function for attribute k ∈ {w, j}. Ψ is indexed on the attribute k and individual n because, in a more general form, its shape parameters could depend on the characteristics of individual n and the intensity and the type of modality (e.g., time or number) of attribute k.</p><p>Perceived attributes (Ψ). Let's suppose that time perception follows either Fechner's or Steven's law. Then the perceived value of an attribute is given by the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">Ψ(•) = κ • log(t) if Fechner's law κ • t α if Stevens' law (7)</formula><p>where κ is a constant that depends on the units of the time stimuli (e.g., seconds, minutes), t is the magnitude of the time stimuli, and α is the curvature of a perception function that follows Steven's law.</p><p>To distinguish which psychophysical law fits the choice data better, we can directly compare the goodness of fit of models that use either Fechner's or Stevens' laws to represent the time attributes in the utility function. Another approach proposed in prior literature is to leverage the Box-Cox transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Doyle, 2013)</ref> as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">Ψ(t, α, κ) = κ log(t) if α = 0 κ t α −1 α if α 0<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where α and κ are parameters of the psychophysical functions. Note if Ψ(t, α, κ) is divided by κ, the expression in Eq. 8 resembles the standard form of the Box-Cox transformation. Therefore, if α = 0, there is supporting evidence for Fechner's logarithmic law. If α = 1, the psychophysical function becomes linear on the magnitude of the real stimuli and thus, there is no influence of time perception. For any other estimated value of α {0, 1}, there is support for Stevens' power law. This approach is convenient because it requires fitting a single model to the choice data. To our knowledge, ours is the first study that implements this idea.</p><p>Scale parameter (λ). Prior cognitive modeling studies have coined the term temperature to define the scale parameter λ of the logit function <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Weiss-Cohen et al., 2018)</ref>. Under a random utility theory (RUT) framework, λ is not identifiable as it is confounded in the estimates of the preference parameters obtained from participants' choice data. From a theoretical standpoint, higher values of the scale parameter λ are associated with a lower variance of the error term and this makes decisions more deterministic. In the extreme case where λ → 0, choice probabilities are equilikely. Conversely, lower values of λ are associated with a higher variance of the random term, which means that decisions begin to be made at random. If λ → 1 choice probabilities are fully deterministic and equal to an indicator function taking the value 1 if the utility of the chosen alternative is higher than the foregone alternative, and 0 otherwise.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identifiability (θ).</head><p>A proper understanding of the scale parameter is relevant to avoid a misinterpretation of the parameter estimates of the logit model. The scale parameter λ is not identifiable and thus, setting the value of λ to an arbitrary value has no effect on the prediction of choice probabilities. To illustrate how the scale parameter affects the identifiability of the behavioral parameters in our formulation, let's start substituting Eq. 6 (or Eq.5) into Eq.4:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">P ni = 1 1 + e λ(V nj −V ni ) = 1 1 + e λ(∑ k∈{w,v} β nk (Ψ(x jk ,α nk ,κ nk )−Ψ(x ik ,α nk ,κ nk )))<label>(9)</label></formula><p>To account for the Box-Cox transformation, let's multiply and divide the argument of the exponential function in Eq. 9 by κ, noting that the ratio between Ψ(x, α, κ) and κ only depends on α and x (Eq. 8):</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">P ni = 1 1 + e ∑ k∈{w,v} λβ nk κ nk (Ψ(k j ,α nk ,κ nk )/κ nk −Ψ(k i ,α nk ,κ nk )/κ nk ) = 1 1 + e ∑ k∈{w,v} θ nk (Ψ(x jk ,α nk )−Ψ(x ik ,α nk ))<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where θ nw = λβ nw κ nw and θ nv = λβ nv κ nv are the parameters of the logit model associated to waiting and invehicle times, respectively. As with any logit model, parameters θ are, by construction, scaled by λ. In our model specification, the parameters θ are also scaled by the scale constants κ nw and κ nv of the psychophysical function associated with waiting and in-vehicle times, respectively. Therefore, the individual values of β, κ, λ will be not identifiable but only their product equal to θ.</p><p>Marginal utility (θ). Parameters θ quantify the marginal variation in utility to a change in an attribute's value, what is known in Economics as marginal utility. When the utility function is assumed to be a linear weight between attributes and their corresponding preference parameters (Eq. 5) 8 , the marginal utility of an attribute becomes equal to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">∂V ni ∂x ik = θ nk = λβ nk<label>(11)</label></formula><p>If time perception is accounted for in the specification of the utility function, a similar relationship is found but only if the marginal utility is computed with respect to the perceived values of the time attributes. Formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">∂V ni ∂Ψ nk = θ nk = λβ nk κ nk (12)</formula><p>Marginal rate of substitution (ρ). To assess the relative preferences of individuals for different attributes and to also avoid the problem of scale, it is useful to compute the ratio between two estimated parameters of the logit model. As shown in Eq. 13, if the utility function is assumed to be a linear weight between attributes and their corresponding preference parameters (Eq. 5), the ratio of the parameters θ become equal to the ratio between the marginal utilities of the two attributes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">ρ w,v = ∂V ∂w ∂V ∂v = θ nw θ nv = λβ nw λβ nv = β nw β nv (13)</formula><p>where ρ w,v is the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) of waiting for in-vehicle time and represents the amount of in-vehicle time that an individual may willing to increase for reducing waiting time. By definition, higher or lower values of β w relative to β v suggest that a variation in waiting times looms larger or lower in utility than the same variation in in-vehicle time.</p><p>If time perception is accounted for in the specification of the utility function, the MRS becomes dependent on the attribute levels and on the psychophysical parameters α and κ. Thus, for any multi-attribute decision context, the MRS will be no longer equal to the preference weights β. This can be seen directly from the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">ρ w,v = ∂V ni ∂w i ∂V ni ∂v i =        β nw κ nw β nv κ nv 1/w i 1/v i if Fechner's law β nw κ nw β nv κ nv α nw w i αnw−1 α nv v i αnv−1 if Steven's law<label>(14)</label></formula><p>8 Note that Eq. 5 do not account for the fact that θ = βλ but not β alone is identifiable</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Hypotheses</head><p>Below we specify six hypotheses concerning the influence of time perception on decision-making. They are built on the assumptions and notation presented in Appendix C. To render them empirically testable under a discrete choice modeling framework, each hypothesis is expressed in terms of the parameter values of the behavioral model described in Section 4.2. Hypotheses H N-1 and H A-1 aim at replicating previous findings in the literature on travel behavior and time perception, respectively. Hypotheses H A-2 and H A-3 are formulated based on the analysis of Section 3. Hypotheses H AN-1 and H AN-2 summarize the most important findings from our paper.</p><p>H N-1 . The marginal rate of substitution of waiting time for invehicle time is greater than 1 in the numerical choices</p><p>This hypothesis implies that a marginal variation in waiting times has a higher impact on route choices than the same variation in in-vehicle times. It is also in line with the phenomenon of aversion to waiting time discussed in Section 3.1.3. With a linear-in-parameters utility function, this means that the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) of waiting for in-vehicle time is larger than 1 (Eq. 13). If the effect of human perception is accounted for, the utility function is not linear, and thus, the analysis of the MRS is not straightforward.</p><p>Experiments involving monetary and time-related decisions show that choices made from numerical information are subject to perceptual distortions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abdellaoui and Kemel, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Tversky and Kahneman, 1992)</ref>. To capture the impact of the perception of waiting and in-vehicle times on the numerical choices, we add both attributes into the utility function using the Box-Cox transformation (Section 4.2). As result, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) of waiting time for in-vehicle time become dependent on both the values of the time attributes and the shape parameters of the psychophysical functions of time perception (Eq.14).</p><p>To understand the impact of the value of the exponents of the psychophysical functions on the MRS, we derive some mathematical propositions (Appendix B) and perform some simulations using synthetic choice data (Appendix E). The simulations assume that the exponents of the time attributes are the same but not necessarily equal to 1 (Assumption A 4 , Eq. 41, Appendix C). Interestingly, Proposition 3 B , Appendix B suggests that if the exponents of the attributes are the same 9 , the MRS is not dependent on the exponent's value. In line with this finding, the simulation results in Appendix E show that the ratio of the linear weights of waiting and in-vehicle times is roughly independent of the exponent's value. Thus, both results suggest that, regardless of the exponent's value of the psychophysical functions, the MRS in the numerical choices should be still higher than 1 due to aversion to waiting time.</p><p>To empirically test H N-1 under a discrete choice modelling framework, we define the following null and alternative hypotheses on the choice data gathered from Santiago and London:</p><formula xml:id="formula_24">H o :θ n gŵ θ n gv = 1, H a :θ n gŵ θ n gv &gt; 1, ∀g ∈ {s, l}<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where a rejection of H 0 supports the alternative hypotheses that the MRS is significantly greater than 1 in the numerical choices.</p><p>H A-1 . The perception of waiting and in-vehicle times in the animated choices follows Steven's power law.</p><p>Most psychophysical evidence supports a power law over a logarithmic law for describing how chronometric time is mapped into perceived time.

In line with this evidence, Proposition P 1 , Appendix B suggests that Fechner's logarithmic function is not appropriate for accounting for the influence of time perception in our choice data.</p><p>To empirically test H A1 , we formulate the following null and alternative hypotheses:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">H 0 :α a gw ,α ac gv = 0, H a :α ac gw ,α a gv 0, ∀g ∈ {s, l} (16)</formula><p>where a rejection of H 0 supports the alternative hypothesis H a that the perception of time in the animated choices follows Stevens' power law.

The exponent of the psychophysical function of invehicle time is greater than or equal to that of waiting time in the animated choices.</p><p>The analysis of time estimation responses shows that participants correctly estimate waiting time but overestimate in-vehicle times (Section 3.3.1). A potential explanation for this result was the difference in the stimulus intensity used to elicit waiting time and in-vehicle times during the animated choices (Section 3.4.2). This realization led us to hypothesize in H A-2 that the exponent of the perception function is higher for in-vehicle time than waiting time.</p><p>To gain insights into the mathematical relationship between the exponent of the power law function and the average estimate of a time attribute, we formulate propositions P 2A-2D in Appendix B. Under the assumption of concavity of the time perception function (i.e., exponents lower or equal than 1), Proposition P 2B suggests that the lower bound of the exponent of the Stevens' power function is inversely proportional to the average values of attributes that are well-estimated or overestimated. The lower bound is dependent on the value of the scale constant of an attribute but if two attributes are in the same modality, it is reasonable to claim that the scale constant κ is equal for both attributes (Assumption A 3C , Appendix C). Thus, based on the fact that the average in-vehicle time is higher than waiting time, it follows that the lower bound of the exponent is higher for travel time than for waiting time 10 .</p><p>Furthermore, under the assumption that the exponent of waiting time is equal to 1, Proposition P 2C implies that the exponent of in-vehicle time is necessarily higher than 1. Alternatively, Proposition P 3D leads to the same conclusion but under the milder assumption that the values of the time attribute that is overestimated, i.e., travel time, are strictly greater than the values of the attribute that is well-estimated, i.e. waiting time.

This is in line with the analysis of choice responses (Section 3.2.2) showing a decrease in the preferences for alternatives with lower waiting times in the treatment condition of the animated choices. Because no differences in time estimation were observed between participants (Section 3.3.1) in both between-participants conditions of the animated choices, the exponent of the psychophysical function for waiting time can be safely assumed to be the same (Assumption A A1 , Appendix C)</p><p>Formally, H A-3 is tested by formulating the following null and alternative hypotheses:</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">H 0 :θ at ngw =θ ac ngw , H a :θ at ngw &lt;θ ac ngw , ∀g ∈ {s, l} (18)</formula><p>where a rejection of H 0 supports H A-3 .</p><p>H AN-1 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.3.">Model that jointly captures the effect of perception and</head><p>preferences from all experimental conditions To better capture the influence of human perception under a discrete choice modeling framework, we formulated a model that simultaneously uses the choice data gathered from all experimental conditions. The incorporation of all choice data from the experiment involves some modeling considerations. In line with Assumptions A 1 , A 2 (Appendix C), preferences for waiting and invehicle times are assumed to be equal across experimental conditions. Per Assumption A 4 , Appendix C, the time perception parameter between experimental conditions are assumed to be equal only in the numerical choices. In the animated choices, the difference in intensity of the stimulus used to mimic waiting and in-vehicle times are  captured with exponents of the perception function that are specific to the time attribute. Furthermore, participants were required to choose their preferred bus alternative according to the color of the bus routes shown in the learning stage, which could have induced additional sources of random error in the participants' responses. This error is captured in the model with scale factors of the random perturbations that are specific to the animated and numerical choices condition. The latter resembles the strategy used in mixed RP/SP models of the discrete choice modeling literature to simultaneously incorporate revealed preference (RP) and stated preference (SP) data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cherchi and Ortúzar, 2002)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">Tables 7 and 8</ref> show the estimation results for Santiago and London, respectively. To account for the difference in preferences for waiting and in-vehicle times between cities, we pooled the data by city 11 . Note that the introduction of the scale parameter in the Linear Mixed model significantly increases the goodness of fit of the Linear model in both cities. Besides, the estimation of the Box Cox 2 mixed model suggests that the estimation of a single exponential parameter has a goodness of fit that is comparable to the Box Cox 1 mixed model where all exponential parameters are free. In line with hypothesis H A-2 , the exponential parameter is lower for waiting time than in-vehicle time, i.e. α A w &lt; α A v = 1. Subsequently, we fit the Box-Cox Mixed 3 model to capture the impact of revealing waiting times in the animated choices. In line with Assumption A A1 , we do not include a specific exponential parameter for choice data gathered in the treatment condition. Per assumption, A A2 , we simply add an interaction term between waiting time and the type of between-participants condition to capture the effect of the treatment. In line with hypothesis H A-3 , our estimation results show that the parameter (δ A w ) is negative, meaning that revealing waiting time increases the disutility for this attribute. The interaction is significant in Chile but only at the 90% level of confidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Time perception and decision-making are fields that have been thoroughly studied. However, just a few studies have attempted to associate the cognitive processes involved in these task domains in a systematic way. Even in those studies, participants performed decision tasks in which relevant time attributes were described using numerical quantities only. This study used the traditional route choice problem studied in travel behavior research as a test bed to understand the impact of time perception on decision-making. Route choice decisions in public transport require individuals to trade off multiple time attributes and individuals often have to rely on the perceived values of those attributes to make their travel decisions. A series of hypotheses were formulated to uncover the impact of perception on route choice. These were examined using regression analyses on experimental data. The results were used to derive mathematical propositions. Subsequently, these were empirically tested using behavioral models developed within a discrete choice modeling framework. To assess the robustness of our experimental findings, the data were collected in major cities in two countries that have similar public transport systems.</p><p>To mimic real-world commuting decisions, we designed an experiment in which participants were presented with two bus routes with different waiting and in-vehicle times. Following the state-of-the-practice in prior route choice experiments, one experimental condition presented the value of the time attributes of the bus routes using numeric quantities. A distinct feature of the experimental design was the inclusion of an animated condition in which participants watched animated bus journeys in order to internalize the values of the time attributes associated with those journeys.</p><p>The participants' choice data was first analyzed with regression models to assess the impact of various experimental manipulations. The data gathered in the numerical condition served as a baseline to understand the impact of time perception on participants' route choices in the animated condition. Based on prior travel behavior studies, participants were expected to exhibit aversion to waiting time, that is, a tendency to prefer to minimize waiting over in-vehicle time when choosing between travel alternatives. Surprisingly, this behavioral response could not be replicated in the animated condition. Furthermore, the analysis of the participants' time estimation responses showed that individuals accurately estimated waiting time but overestimated in-vehicle time in the animated condition. This evidence was key to hypothesizing that the reversal in the preferences for waiting and in-vehicle times was caused by the different abil-ity of participants to estimate each time attribute within the animated condition.</p><p>Our results showed that Stevens' power law was better than Fechner's logarithmic law for modeling the mapping of chronometric time into subjective time during the experiment. The modeling strategy used to distinguish between psychophysical laws was grounded in the Box-Cox transformation. To increase the statistical power to identify the exponential parameters of the psychophysical functions, we formulated a behavioral model that incorporated the choice data from all experimental conditions. This modeling strategy was supported by prior travel behavior studies that propose the use of mixed models to incorporate data gathered from different surveys, experiments, or populations. The analysis of the goodness of fit of the models suggests that the preferences for waiting and in-vehicle times are properly recovered if the impact of time perception is captured in the model specification. The estimation results showed that the exponential parameter in the animated condition was higher for in-vehicle time than waiting time and that the parameter associated with in-vehicle time was higher than 1. This finding is consistent with both the overestimation of in-vehicle time and the accurate estimation of waiting time observed in the time estimation task. Overall, the estimation results suggest that the influence of time perception on decision-making can be properly captured via a discrete choice modeling framework and that the conclusions are robust across cities.</p><p>Further research could address some limitations of the present work. Time estimation responses can be sensitive to the method of time estimation, the duration of the target interval, the nature of the estimation paradigm, and the choice of stimuli, among other factors. Thus, further studies could attempt to replicate our findings using a different type of time estimation task. This could involve the use of virtual reality technologies to induce a more realistic travel experience. Also, a time estimation task that requires participants to estimate time durations in multiple scenarios would allow estimating the time perception parameters exogenously, i.e., without using the participants' choice data. Exogenous estimation brings some advantages, such as building a prior for the estimation of the exponential parameters of the time perception functions and having a reference value for the parameters estimated with a discrete choice model. Finally, in terms of the modeling strategy, a more flexible specification of the discrete choice model could better account for the heterogeneity of preferences and perception capacity of participants. The drawback of this approach is that a larger amount of data would be required due to the additional degrees of freedom required by more flexible specifications. Despite the aforementioned limitations, the consistency between the findings of our study and of previous time perception and travel behavior studies lead us to believe that our estimation strategy and the choice of visual stimulus used to represent the experience of waiting 1.000 (fixed) 1.000 (fixed) 1.081 (7.5) 1.000 (fixed) 1.000 (fixed) Exponent of animated waiting time (α A w ) 1.000 (fixed) 1.000 (fixed) 0.870 (4.4) 1.000 (fixed) 1.000 (fixed) Exponent of animated in-vehicle time (α A v ) 1.000 (fixed) 1.000 (fixed) 1.000 (fixed) 1.089 (50.4) 1.118 (42.2) Effect of revealing waiting time (δ A w )  Linear weight of numeric waiting time (θ N w ) −0.780 (−7.6) −1.540 (−6.8) −1.937 (−6.9) −1.566 (−6.9) −1.566 (−6.9) Linear weight of numeric in-vehicle time (θ N v ) −0.722 (−7.9) −1.370 (−6.9) −1.498 (−3.2) −1.374 (−6.9) −1.374 (−6.9) Relative scale factor of animated time (ϕ A )</p><formula xml:id="formula_31">- - - - −0.206 (−1.8)</formula><p>1.000 (fixed) 0.242 (2.7) 0.721 (2.2) 0.220 (2.6) 0.204 (2.4) Exponent of numeric time (α N )</p><p>1.000 (fixed) 1.000 (fixed) 1.081 (7.5) 1.000 (fixed) 1.000 (fixed) Exponent of animated waiting time (α A w ) 1.000 (fixed) 1.000 (fixed) 0.870 (4.4) 1.000 (fixed) 1.000 (fixed) Exponent of animated in-vehicle time (α A v ) 1.000 (fixed) 1.000 <ref type="formula">(fixed</ref> and traveling in public transport were appropriate for investigating the influence of time perception on decisionmaking about time.</p></div>

Supraindices refer to the experimental condition and subindices to the characteristics of individual n ∈ N, its city of origin g ∈ {s, l} and type of attribute k ∈ {w, v}. If choices from two experimental conditions or decision scenarios are made by the same participant, it is reasonable to expect that their preference weights will be the same. For a similar argument, the time perception function and the scale of the random errors can be also assumed to be homogeneous for a set of choices made by the same participant.

However, if the time perception function Ψ nik is consistent with Steven's law, an exponential parameter is introduced in V, and hence the global concavity of ℓ cannot be guaranteed. In this setting, an optimization of the likelihood function can lead to local optima and it can be highly sensitive to the starting points for the optimization. Therefore, non-convex optimization problems are hard to solve and there are only guarantees of convergence toward local optima.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.3 Optimization algorithm</head><p>Grid search is a gradient-free optimization method that can be useful to deal with low-dimensional non-convex objectives. The quality of the solution and performance obtained by a grid search directly depends on the size and dimension of the feasible space. This consideration is key as the solution to a problem with a grid search could become intractable with the curse of dimensionality. In our problem, the parameter search can be easily narrowed by leveraging the concavity of the likelihood function once the vector of exponential parameters of the time perception functions α α α is known. Therefore, this equates to conducting a grid search on α α α and then solving a convex optimization for the linear parameters of the utility function.</p><p>As shown in algorithm 1, the Cartesian product given by α α α 1 × . . . × α α α D makes the computational complexity to growth exponentially with the dimension D of the vector of exponential parameters (O(T D )). The level of granularity to search the feasible space is moderated by T and it should be set according to the computational resources.</p><p>To reduce the computational burden in problems with a large number of exponential parameters, it is recommended a random search over an arbitrary range of values for the parameters. Random search has been used extensively in the machine learning community in the context of hyper-parameter optimization and it has been shown to exhibit better performance than a deterministic grid search in high dimensional spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bergstra and Bengio, 2012)</ref>. The choice of bounds α α α min , α α α max for the range of values of the grid search conducted the time perception parameters over should be consistent with the results obtained in prior literature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Appendix E Simulations</head><p>To analyze the consistency of our estimation procedure, we generated synthetic choice data and then attempted to recover the ground truth parameters of the utility function. In line with our experimental design, a total of 576 choice responses were generated from 72 synthetic participants across eight decision scenarios. A random perturbation with extreme value distribution was added to the deterministic component of the utility function with the goal of introducing randomness into the data-generating process and of generating choice probabilities consistent with the logit model. The influence of time perception is modeled with Stevens' power law, namely, an exponential transformation of the time attributes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>E.1 Specification of utility function</head><p>The true preference parameters are assumed to be equal to β w = −1.1, β v = −1.0, which equates to a marginal rate of substitution of waiting for in-vehicle time of 1.1. That is, participants would be willing to increase their in-vehicle time by 1.1 minutes if their waiting time decreases by one minute.</p><p>For the sake of simplicity, the scale parameters of the psychophysical functions for waiting and in-vehicle times are set to κ w = κ v = 1. In addition, the exponential parameters α w , α v of the psychophysical functions are assumed to be equal for both time attributes. This setting is consistent with the assumptions used to formulate the utility function in the numerical choices condition. Mathematically, the specification of the deterministic component of the utility function for the alternative i is the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_64">V i = β nw κ nw w α w i + β v κ v v α v i = −1 • w α i − 1.1 • v α i<label>(51)</label></formula><p>For the simulation, α 1 represents a scenario where perception influences decision-making. To avoid confusion, we do not refer to it as time perception because the assumptions made for simulation are consistent with the numerical condition 14 .</p><p>E.2 Scenarios S 1 : Effect of perception is known. The baseline scenario represents a situation where the shape of the psychophysical function of perception is fully known. For the sake of ease, the true data generating process (DGP) sets the exponential parameter of both time attributes to α = 1. Thus, the utility function becomes linear in parameters. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref> shows the distribution of the parameters' estimates obtained over 200 Monte-Carlo simulations. The density curves are Gaussian distributions with shape parameters corresponding to the mean and standard deviation of the parameter estimates. The dashed vertical line represents the true value of the parameters associated with in-vehicle and waiting times. The plots on the left side illustrate the impact of the scale parameter of the random error λ on the estimates of the parameters of the utility function. As expected, the parameter estimates approach zero, and hence their bias increase with a higher value of λ. However, as shown in the plots on the left side, the estimates become unbiased when they are scaled by λ. With non-synthetic data, there is no access to λ, and thus, the modeler can only identify the weight between the linear parameters and λ (see discussion on identifiability, Section 4.2). λ is inversely proportional to the variance of the random error of the extreme value distribution, that is, the extent of unobservables in the utility function.</p><formula xml:id="formula_65">θ w θ w λ θ v θ v</formula><p>S 2 : The effect of perception is not captured. This scenario studies the impact of ignoring the effect of perception on the specification of the utility function. The influence of perception is induced by setting α = 0.9 in the specification of the utility function of the true DGP 15 . To estimate <ref type="bibr">15</ref> In practice, any value of α close to 1 can be used for the simulation. the ground truth parameters, the utility function is intentionally misspecified by fixing α = 1. This may represent a situation in the transportation literature where a linearin-parameters utility function is wrongly assumed to capture the impact of human perception in travel decisions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> shows the distribution of estimates of the parameters associated with the preferences for waiting and in-vehicle times. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref> shows the marginal rate of substitution of waiting for in-vehicle times. In contrast to Simulation S 1 , the adjustment of the parameter estimates by the scale of the random error λ does not fully correct the bias. Regardless, the bias of the preference parameters is not transferred to the marginal rate of substitution and hence, the latter can be properly recovered. S 3 : The effect of perception is captured. In contrast to the previous scenarios, α is now defined as a free parameter. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows the distribution of estimates of the parameters associated with the preferences for waiting and in-vehicle times when α is jointly estimated. The plots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> show the distribution of estimates of α and of the marginal rate of substitution of waiting for in-vehicle time. Note that the inclusion of α as a free parameter significantly increases the variance of the estimates of the preference parameter <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 13</ref>) compared to scenarios S 1 and S 2 . However, the parameters are now unbiased. The estimator of α has a higher variance than the estimator of the MRS and it is unbiased. Despite the increase in the variance of the parameter estimates, the marginal rate of substitution exhibits the same efficiency observed in the previous scenarios. E.3 Insights I 1 . The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) can be recovered when the influence of time perception is not captured but only if the exponents of the time attributes are the same Simulation S 1 shows that the linear weights of the utility function estimated with a logit model are confounded with the scale of the random error. A direct implication is that only the ratio between two linear weights can be recovered. This result can be proven to hold for the linearin-parameters utility function because the scale of the random error gets canceled out (Eq. 13, Section 4.2). A more interesting finding is observed in Simulation S 2 where the MRS is shown to be recovered even when the utility function is misspecified. Simulation S 3 shows the same finding. This result will not necessarily hold in a model where the exponents of the time attributes are different. I 2 . Low statistical power to capture the effect of perception in the discrete choice model.</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">θ w θ w λ θ v θ v</formula><formula xml:id="formula_67">θ w λ θ v λ θ w θ v<label>−</label></formula><p>The estimators of the time perception parameters indicate an increase in variance when the effect of perception is captured in the discrete choice model. This can lead to confidence intervals with higher coverages and hence a lower rejection of the null hypotheses. Possible remedies to increase statistical power are to increase the sample size or to limit the degrees of freedom of the model by combining choice data from multiple experimental conditions. A different choice of the attributes' values set in the decision scenarios can also contribute to better identification of the exponential parameter of the time attributes. I 3 . Bias-variance trade-off in models that captures the effect of perception.</p><p>Simulation S 3 shows that the joint estimation of the effect of time perception and the preference parameters results in estimators with a high variance but no biased. Simulation S 2 shows that ignoring the effect of time perception results in biased estimators but with low variance. Hence, if the sample size or the effect of time perception is small, hypothesis testing may become more reliable when time perception is not captured. The reason is that the reduction in the variance of the estimators could compensate for a small increase in bias. In contrast, with a larger sample size, it may be convenient to estimate the effect of time perception in the model.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Representation of the network layout shown in the virtual environment.</figDesc></figure>
