				<p>Continuous-outcome decisions, in which responses are made on continuous scales, are increasingly used to study perception and memory for stimulus attributes like color, orientation, and motion. This interest has led to the development of models of continuousoutcome decision processes like the circular diffusion model that predict joint distributions of decision outcomes and response times (RT). We use the circular diffusion model and a new spherical generalization of it to model performance in a continuous-outcome version of the random dot motion task. The task is a benchmark test of decision models because it yields bimodal distributions of decision outcomes: In addition to a peak or mode in the true direction of motion, there is a secondary, antipodal, mode at 180 • to the true direction. Models like the circular diffusion model, in which evidence is accumulated by a single process, are thought to be unable to predict bimodality. We compared diffusion models for the continuous motion task in which evidence is accumulated in either a 2D or a 3D representational space. We found that performance was well-described by a spherical (3D) diffusion model in which the drift rate encodes perceived motion direction and strength and the points on the bounding sphere representing the decision criterion are projected onto a 2D circle to make a response. A model with an antipodal component of drift rate and drift-rate variability successfully predicted bimodal distributions of decision outcomes and the joint distributions of decision outcomes and RT for individual participants.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Continuous-outcome decision tasks, in which responses are made on continuous spatial scales, have come to play an increasingly important role in the study of perceptual and cognitive processes. Historically, the continuous-outcome task has its origins in the method of adjustment of classical psychophysics, in which sensory thresholds were measured by asking observers to adjust the intensity of a test stimulus until it matched that of a standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Woodworth &amp; Schlosberg, 1954)</ref>. Continuous-outcome tasks were reintroduced to contemporary psychology during the 1990s by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Blake et al. (1997)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Prinzmetal et al. (1998)</ref>, who used them to study visual working memory for motion and the effects of attention on perceptual variability, respectively. Subsequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Wilken and Ma (2004)</ref> used the continuous-outcome task to investigate the precision of visual working memory <ref type="bibr">(VWM)</ref> for color, orientation, and spatial frequency. Since their study, the task has become the method of choice for many VWM researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adam et al.;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bays et al.;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Oberauer &amp; Lin, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">van den Berg, et al.;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Zhang &amp; Luck, 2008)</ref> because it provides information about the variability of the cognitive representations that underlie response accuracy. The task has also been used to investigate categorical perception of color and categorical recall of color from short-term and long-term memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bae, et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hardman et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Persaud &amp; Hemmer, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>In the wake of the increasing use of continuous-outcome tasks in perception and memory has come an interest in understanding them as decision tasks and in developing models that can predict distributions of decision outcomes and response times (RT). To date, there have been two such models: the circular diffusion model of Smith and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Smith, 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Smith, , 2019</ref> and the spatially-continuous diffusion model (SCDM) of <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Ratcliff (2018)</ref>. The circular diffusion model represents the decision process as evidence accumulation by a two-dimensional (2D) Wiener, or Brownian motion, diffusion process on the interior of a disk whose bounding circle represents the decision criterion for the task. The SCDM represents the process as evidence accumulation by an infinite array of correlated accumulators, one for each response, which collectively are modeled as a Gaussian random process. The dimensionality of the evidence process in the circular diffusion model is equal to the dimensionality of the stimulus space, which, for isoluminant color and planar orientation and motion, is two dimensional. The dimensionality of the process in the SCDM is equal to the dimensionality of the state vector that determines the number of response alternatives, which is infinite. The relationship between the two models is analogous to the relationship between the two main classes of evidence accumulation models for two-choice decisions: diffusion or random-walk models, on the one hand, and accumulator or counter models, on the other. In diffusion and random walk models <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Laming, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Link &amp; Heath, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Ratcliff, 1978)</ref> evidence accumulation is represented by a single, signed evidence total that represents the instantaneous difference in the evidence for one response versus the other. In accumulator and counter models <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Smith &amp; van Zandt, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Smith &amp; Vickers, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Vickers, 1979)</ref> each alternative is represented by its own evidence total and the response is determined by the first total to reach its criterion. In the circular diffusion model there is, similarly, a single evidence total that represents the evidence in favor of one response versus all of the others, while in the SCDM each alternative is represented by its own total.</p><p>In this article, we apply the circular diffusion model and a spherical generalization of it to decisions about coherent motion in the random dot motion (RDM) task. Unlike the circular model, the spherical model assumes that the representational space of the decision process, in which evidence is accumulated, and the response space, in which the decision is expressed, may be of different dimensions. The idea that there may be a difference in dimension of these two spaces has implications for cognitive phenomena like confidence, uncertainty, urgency, and the effects of stimulus intensity, which we discuss subsequently.</p><p>In the RDM task, participants are presented with arrays of randomly-moving dots, some proportion of which move coherently in a given direction. The two-choice version of this task is one of the most highly-studied decision tasks in psychology and neuroscience <ref type="bibr">(Dutilh et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Palmer, et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Shadlen &amp; Newsome, 2001</ref>) and a few researchers have also studied n-choice versions of it. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Churchland et al. (2008)</ref> compared two and four choice versions and van Maanen et al. (2012) compared three, five, and seven choice versions. More recently, some researchers have begun investigating a continuous-outcome version of this task in which the coherent motion may be in any direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Bae &amp; Luck, 2019</ref>). The continuous-outcome version of the task is of theoretical interest because it leads to a striking and unexpected pattern of findings that represents a challenge to the circular diffusion model -namely, it can result in bimodal distributions of decision outcomes. In addition to a peak or mode in the distribution of decision outcomes centered on the true motion direction (0 • ), some observers show a secondary, or "shadow" mode, centered on the opposite (antipodal) direction (180 • ). This implies that observers can accurately perceive the orientation of the optic flow field induced by the motion but sometimes mistake the direction of the flow within the field. A number of researchers (including us) have been informally aware of this feature of the continuous-outcome RDM task for some time, but the first published report of it we are aware of was by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bae and Luck (2019)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> shows data from <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bae and Luck's (2019)</ref> study. As shown in the upper panels, the task was an RDM task that used the same paradigm as used by Shadlen and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Gold &amp; Shadlen, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Roitman &amp; Shadlen, 2002)</ref>, in which each dot is plotted for one 16.7 ms frame and then replotted three frames later. Each dot has a specified probability of moving in a coherent, as opposed to a random, direction each time it is replotted. Because the coherence of the movement of each dot is determined each time it is replotted it is not possible to extract the direction of motion from the trajectory of individual dots, but only from the ensemble statistics of the display as a whole. In the Bae and Luck study, the probability of coherent motion was either 25.6% or 51.2%. The lower panels show the distributions of response errors for the two conditions. There is a narrow peak, centered on 0 • , whose height varies with coherence, which is flanked, in the low coherence condition, by long, flat tails, with a smaller, secondary mode at 180 • in either case.</p><p>The secondary mode is a phenomenon potentially of interest to vision researchers and decision researchers alike. Visually, it implies the existence of motion mechanisms that can identify the orientation of the optic flow field but for which the direction of motion within the field is ambiguous. Decisionally, the secondary mode is a benchmark finding that a successful model of continuous-outcome decisions should be able to explain. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adelson and Bergen (1985)</ref>, in their influential article on motion-energy models, described a simple mechanism constructed from oriented spatiotemporal filters for which the direction of motion within an optic flow field is ambiguous in precisely the way shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>.</p><p>The existence of the secondary mode can be viewed as evidence that mechanisms of this kind may underlie the motion percept in the RDM task and we describe such mechanisms and the link with Adelson and Bergen's work in the Discussion. However, our primary focus is on the task as a decision task -specifically, on the claim that tasks producing bimodal distributions of outcomes can provide benchmark tests that allow competing classes of decision models to be distinguished. From a decision-making perspective, the visual mechanisms that give rise to ambiguous motion percepts are most usefully approached by studying them through the lens of the decision processes they drive and this is the perspective we take here.</p><p>Cognitive researchers have long understood the value of qualitative tests that allow broad classes of models to be distinguished from one another, either as an adjunct or an alternative to formal model comparison procedures <ref type="bibr">(Oberauer et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Ratcliff (2018)</ref>, in his article on the SCDM, proposed that bimodality is such a qualitative property that might allow the SCDM to be distinguished from models like the circular diffusion model. He reported data from a comparative brightness task using luminance blobs in random noise arrays in which participants moved their eyes, hands, or a computer mouse to the point of maximum brightness in the display, and found bimodal distributions of errors when the displays contained pairs of blobs of similar brightness (e.g., his <ref type="bibr">Figure 5)</ref>. He argued that this pattern of data represents a theoretical challenge for the circular diffusion model, in which evidence is accumulated by a single process and in which the drift rate, which determines the rate of evidence accumulation, is a vector. The model naturally predicts unimodal distributions of responses as a result. In contrast, in the SCDM, evidence is accumulated by an infinite array of accumulators and the drift rate is a continuous function, which describes the rate of accumulation in every member of the array simultaneously. In displays with pairs of competing stimuli it is natural to assume that the drift rate function in the SCDM is bimodal rather than unimodal, which allows it to predict bimodal response distributions.</p><p>Apart from its interest as a perceptual and decision task, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bae and Luck's (2019)</ref> results suggest that the continuous-outcome RDM task can serve as a test bed in which to evaluate <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Ratcliff's (2018)</ref> claim. The form of bimodality shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> is more restricted than the one discussed by him, but it recommends itself as a critical instance of the phenomenon for two reasons. First, the secondary mode occurs on the opposite side of the response space to the true motion direction, which leads to joint distributions of decision outcomes and RTs that are particularly challenging to characterize mathematically, as we discuss subsequently. Second, it arises in response to exactly the same motion direction as the one that produced the primary mode. It is therefore most plausibly characterized as reflecting some form of trial-to-trial variability in the mechanisms that determine the drift rate of the evidence accumulation process, which constrains the way in which it should be viewed theoretically and modeled mathematically. Our article should be viewed, in part, as an existence proof of the claim that a diffusion model with a single evidence accumulation process can produce bimodal distributions of outcomes and can account for the entire pattern of RTs and accuracy associated with those outcomes. Our larger contribution is to show that a higher-dimensional generalization of the circular diffusion model can account for a richer and more complex pattern of RT and decision outcome data than has previously been shown empirically or predicted theoretically. We consider the relationship with Ratcliff's results in the Discussion. A partial response to Ratcliff's claims about bimodality was made by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kvam and Turner (2021)</ref> and our preferred model is an explicit mathematical formalization of ideas related to those in their article, as we discuss subsequently.</p><p>When we first completed a manuscript for this article, little was known about the shadow mode beyond the basic finding in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> and our own results. Since then, two new studies have investigated the conditions under which it occurs and established its generality and robustness across a variety of experimental manipulations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bae and Luck (2022)</ref> studied it in four experiments in which they varied the coherence and the duration of the stimuli, the contrast polarity, and whether or not participants received feedback. They found antipodal responses with both short (300 ms) and long (1000 ms) presentations and low (25%) and high (50%) coherence, with a higher proportion of them when coherence was low, in agreement with <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. They excluded visual persistence as a determining factor of the effect, as might have been hypothesized from a "motion streaks" account <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Geisler, 1999</ref>) by comparing dark-on-light to light-on-dark stimulus displays, and also showed the effect was not eliminated by provision of trial-to-trial feedback. They also showed that confidence was higher for responses in the antipodal (±π) direction than in orthogonal (±π/2) directions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Manning et al. (2022)</ref> reviewed a collection of studies, including conference presentations and informal reports of experiments carried out with both adult participants and children, which found that participants in the RDM task sometimes report seeing antipodal motion even when the motion is 100% coherent. They remarked that the phenomenon seems to have been observed much more widely than has been reported in the literature.</p><p>They also commented that antipodal motion is typically only reported by a subset of participants. This observation agrees with our own findings, using small-N psychophysical tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Smith &amp; Little, 2018)</ref>, that there are substantial individual differences in the magnitude of the shadow mode effect. In what follows, we first present our theoretical framework, in which we summarize the core properties of the circular diffusion model. We then present a spherical generalization of it and describe our experimental results and modeling work. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> shows the circular diffusion model and some of its key predictions. Evidence accumulation is modeled as a 2D Wiener diffusion process, X t = (X 1 t , X 2 t ) ′ , on the interior of a disk of radius a. In this notation the prime denotes matrix transposition and the superscripts index the coordinates of the process. The growth of X t is characterized by a vector-valued stochastic differential equation,</p></div>

The quantity dW t describes the horizontal and vertical components of the random change in the process X t during a small interval of length dt. The information in the stimulus is represented by a vector-valued drift rate, µ = (µ 1 , µ 2 ) ′ , shown in the figure as an arrow at 45 • (π/4 rad). The rate at which the process diffuses towards the decision boundary is determined by the infinitesimal standard deviation, σ, which is assumed to be the same in the horizontal and vertical directions. The square of the infinitesimal standard deviation, σ 2 , is the diffusion coefficient. In polar coordinates, the drift rate has a length or norm, µ = µ 2 1 + µ 2 2 , and an angle, or direction, θ µ = arctan(µ 2 /µ 1 ). The angle represents the direction in which evidence tends to accumulate, and the norm represents how rapidly it does so. Psychologically, the direction represents the encoded stimulus identity and the norm represents the quality of the encoded representation. of radius a by a 2D Wiener process, X t . The point at which the process hits the bounding circle is the decision outcome and time taken to reach it is the decision time. The drift rate is vector-valued, µ, with norm µ and direction θ µ , here equal to π/4 rad.

When there is across-trial variability in drift rates responses in the tails of the distribution of decision outcomes are slowed.</p><p>Evidence accumulation begins at the origin at time zero with the onset of the stimulus.</p><p>The process then diffuses randomly until it hits a point on the bounding circle, which represents the decision criterion for the task. As in other evidence accumulation models, the decision criterion is assumed to be under the decision maker's control: Larger values of criterion lead to slower, but more accurate, responses. The irregular line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> represents the evidence trajectory, or sample path, of the process on one experimental trial.</p><p>The hitting point on the boundary is denoted X T and the hitting time is denoted T . (We use uppercase T to distinguish time as a random variable from time as a fixed quantity, t.) The hitting point is the reported decision outcome (where the participant saccades or moves the mouse) and the hitting time is the decision time component of RT. Like the diffusion model for two-choice decisions, RT is assumed to be the sum of the decision time and an independent nondecision time, denoted, following <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Ratcliff (1978)</ref>, as T er .</p><p>An attractive feature of the circular diffusion model is that it is possible to write explicit expressions for its predicted joint distributions of decision times and decision outcomes.</p><p>These predictions provide insights into the properties of the model that would be difficult to arrive at by other means and also simplify the task of fitting it to data. The first and most fundamental property is that the model predicts von Mises distributions of decision outcomes. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, the von Mises distribution has a bell-shaped density function, similar to a normal density, but defined on a circular domain rather than on the real line. Most models of continuous-outcome tasks in the VWM and related literatures model distributions of decision outcomes as mixtures of von Mises components, so the fact that the model predicts von Mises distributions is an important point of contact with experimental data. Rather than just providing an empirical characterization of data, however, the von Mises distribution in the circular diffusion model arises as an analytic consequence of its process assumptions.</p><p>A second property is that the model gives a decomposition of the von Mises precision parameter into psychologically meaningful components. The spread, or dispersion, of the von Mises distribution is characterized by a precision or concentration parameter κ (loosely, precision is the reciprocal of variance). The precision parameter in the circular diffusion model admits the decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Smith, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Equation 29)</ref> </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">κ = a µ σ 2 .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>In words, precision is equal to the drift-rate norm multiplied by the decision criterion divided by the diffusion coefficient. Put otherwise, precision is equal to the quality of evidence in the stimulus multiplied by the amount of evidence needed to make a response divided by the noisiness of the evidence accumulation process. This decomposition shows that predicted performance in the circular diffusion model is determined by the same components of processing that determine performance in the diffusion model for two-choice decisions, namely, evidence quality, evidence quantity, and moment-to-moment noise in evidence accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Pleskac &amp; Busemeyer, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Ratcliff, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Smith, 2016;</ref>.</p><p>A third property is the form of the RT distributions predicted by the model. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref>, the model predicts unimodal, positively-skewed distributions of RT, like those found in most speeded, two-choice decision tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Ratcliff, 2002)</ref>. The functions shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2c</ref> are selected joint densities for responses made at different, equally-spaced, points around the response circle. As is apparent from the figure, the functions all have the same shape, and the corresponding conditional densities, obtained by dividing each of the joint densities by the area beneath it, are identical. This means that mean RTs and distributions of RT will be the same for responses made in any direction; in other words, RTs and decision outcomes are independent of each other. This property is a continuous-outcome analogue of the corresponding property of the two-choice Wiener diffusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Ratcliff, 1978)</ref> and of log-likelihood random-walk models <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Bogacz et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Laming, 1968</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Laming, , 1979</ref>. When the only source of variability is moment-to-moment noise in the evidence accumulation process, these models predict identical distributions of RTs for correct responses and errors. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure   2c</ref> shows that the same property carries over to the circular diffusion model.</p><p>When there is across-trial variability in the drift rate or the decision criterion, the circular diffusion model predicts continuous-outcome analogues of the slow-error and fasterror properties of the two-choice diffusion model. When there is variability in drift rate, the two-choice model predicts errors will be slower than correct responses and when there is variability in the starting point for evidence accumulation the model predicts errors will be faster than correct responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008)</ref>. In the circular diffusion model, when there is across-trial variability in drift rate, the model predicts that accurate responses will be faster than inaccurate responses and when there is variability in the radius of the criterion circle it predicts that accurate responses will be slower than inaccurate responses <ref type="bibr">(Smith, 2016, Figures 8 and 9)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2e</ref> shows that the effects of drift-rate variability on mean RT appear as a dish-shaped function in which the fastest responses are the ones made with the smallest angular error.</p><p>To characterize the joint distributions of decision outcomes and decision times explicitly, we denote by dP t (θ) the joint probability density that a 2D Wiener diffusion process with drift rate µ hits the bounding circle a at the point X T = (a cos θ, a sin θ) ′ at a random time T .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling Distributions of Decision Outcomes</head><p>A two-component, von Mises plus uniform, model is a natural prediction of such models <ref type="bibr" target="#b138">(Zhang &amp; Luck, 2008)</ref>. Other models, such as the intrusions model of Bays and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Bays et al., 2009)</ref>  distributions had heavy, uniform tails. <ref type="bibr">Smith et al.</ref> proposed an extension of the circular diffusion model, which they called an encoding failure model, to characterize these distributions. The model assumes that on most trials the identity of the stimulus is encoded accurately, leading to a von Mises error distribution centered on the true stimulus color, but on the remaining trials, encoding fails, leading to a uniform error distribution. They characterized the second process as an encoding failure process rather than a guessing process because, unlike a guessing process, the drift rate on encoding-failure trials was nonzero. A true guessing process would be one in which the decision process is driven by noise alone, which would result in long decision times. Although their data did show slow errors, they were not as slow as predicted by a zero-drift guessing process. The encoding failure model instead assumes that some stimulus information is encoded on every trial, but on encoding failure trials its identity is random, leading to a drift rate with a uniformly distributed polar angle, µ θ . This model, and a second model loosely inspired by Schurgin et al.'s (2020) exponential similarity model, successfully predicted the joint distributions of errors and RT from the task. The second model represented the distribution of µ θ across trials using a Jones-Pewsey distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Jones &amp; Pewsey, 2005)</ref>, which is a leptokurtic distribution that can predict heavier tailed error distributions than the normal distributions of drift rates of Equation 8.</p><p>Neither the encoding failure model nor the Jones-Pewsey drift-rate model naturally predict bimodal distributions of decision outcomes like those in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. Conceptually, the simplest model for bimodality is the one assumed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bae and Luck (2019)</ref>, which models the error distribution as a mixture of a pair of antipodally-centered von Mises distributions (the solid lines in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). Bae and Luck were at pains to stress the ad hoc nature of this model, but it is nevertheless a plausible one. It would be appropriate if, for example, the direction of motion depends on the sign of the difference in the aggregated outputs of two populations of noisy local motion detectors in an opponent-process configuration that signal motion in opposite directions. The circular diffusion counterpart of such a model would be one consisting of a mixture of two antipodal drift rates.</p><p>A second, related, possibility, shown in Figures 2d and 2e is that bimodality arises because of drift rate variability. If the component of drift rate variability in the direction of the mean drift rate, ν, is large, then some proportion of drift rates across trials will have the opposite orientation to ν. If that proportion is large, then a secondary mode can result. Although this is a simple way to a obtain secondary mode, a potential limitation of it is that it requires drift rate variability to be large in order to do so. Large drift rate variability leads to a large slow-error effect, which, like the guessing process discussed above, may be greater that found in data. We evaluate the drift-rate variability model later in the article, but emphasize that these alternatives can only be distinguished using RT data and a model that predicts both accuracy and RT.</p><p>A third, more intriguing, possibility is that bimodality may arise because the dimensionality of the evidence accumulation space is greater than that of the response space.</p><p>That this might be so was first suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Smith and Corbett (2019)</ref> who used a hyperspherical (4D) diffusion model to model two-choice decisions about visual search for double targets in four-item arrays. They modeled evidence accumulation using a 4D diffusion process and the decision criterion as a 3-sphere in 4D space. The 16 orthants (the higher dimensional counterparts of quadrants and octants) of the 3-sphere were identified with the 16 different decision outcomes for the 4D process, which were then mapped to the response alternatives according to the response rules for the task.</p><p>A related idea, in the context of continuous-outcome decisions, was suggested by <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kvam and Turner (2021)</ref>, who proposed that evidence is accumulated in a similarity space whose dimensionality is higher than that of the response space. The dimensionality of the similarity space for any given task can be determined empirically by multidimensional scaling.</p><p>They showed that if the distribution of hitting points in similarity space is projected down onto the first two components of the space, which they assumed correspond to the axes of the response circle in a 2D continuous-outcome task, then bimodal distributions of outcomes could be obtained. The intuition behind this property is that points that are close together in similarity space may become widely separated by the action of projecting them down to a lower dimensional response space. Kvam and Turner showed that bimodal distributions could be obtained if evidence accumulation occurs in a 3D space -represented by diffusion on the interior of a 2-sphere (i.e., an ordinary sphere) -and the points on the surface of the sphere are projected onto the response circle to make a decision. They used this idea to characterize the relationship between the circular diffusion model and Ratcliff's SCDM. We implement and evaluate a related idea here. The focus of <ref type="bibr">Kvam and</ref> Turner's work was on how stimuli occupying nearby points in similarity space could be mapped to widely-separated locations in the response space, whereas our focus is instead on how stimuli that occupy exactly the same location in similarity space can be mapped to widely-separated locations on different trials through the action of across-trial variability in drift rate. We evaluate the predictions of this model at the level of joint distributions of decision times and decision outcomes. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3a</ref> shows a spherical generalization of the circular diffusion model, described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Smith and Corbett (2019)</ref>, in which evidence accumulation is represented by a 3D Wiener</p></div>

Evidence accumulation begins at the center of the sphere and continues until the process hits a point on its surface, that is, until 3 i=1 (X i t ) 2 = a.

Characterizing the locus of hitting points on the sphere requires two polar angles, θ and φ, rather than one. The first angle is the azimuth, −π &lt; θ ≤ π, which gives the polar angle of a point in the (X 1 t , X 2 t ) (equatorial) plane containing the response circle. The second angle is the elevation, 0 ≤ φ ≤ π, which gives the height above the equatorial plane. In standard spherical coordinates φ measures the deviation from the north pole. The locus of hitting points on the sphere at a random time T can be written of radius a by a 3D Wiener diffusion process, X t , with drift rate µ = (µ 1 , µ 2 , µ 3 ) ′ . To make a response, the hitting point, X T , on the surface of the sphere at time T is projected down the meridian of constant azimuth (the dashed line), to a point on the response circle, θ, which determines the decision outcome.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Properties of the Spherical Diffusion Model</head><p>The extra dimension of the spherical diffusion model endows it with some properties not possessed by the circular diffusion model, although, like the circular model, it remains highly constrained in its predictions. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> tries to give a sense of these properties.</p><p>One property is that the model provides an alternative way to represent encoding failures, as described by . They modeled encoding failures using the circular diffusion model with a uniformly-distributed drift-rate angle, θ µ . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3b</ref> shows that another way to represent encoding failures in a spherical model is with a drift rate aligned with the X 3 t axis, which points towards the north (or south) pole. Such a drift rate represents an uninformative stimulus encoding. In the standard spherical coordinates of Equation 9, a vector pointing towards the north pole has angle of φ = 0, but here we use reparameterized coordinates, −π/2 ≤ φ ≤ π/2, in which φ denotes the elevation of the drift-rate vector above (or below) the equatorial plane, as they are more intuitive in this setting. In these coordinates, φ = 0 describes a vector in the equatorial plane and φ = π/2 describes a vector that points towards the north pole. The contours of equal likelihood of the distribution of hitting points for a process with a drift-rate vector aligned with the X 3 t axis will be circular and centered on the north pole. When projected down the meridians of equal azimuth, θ, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3b</ref>, the responses will be uniformly distributed on the response circle. A mixture of the two drift rates will predict peaked high-tailed distributions of errors, like those predicted by the encoding failure model of . However, it does not predict bimodality, which is our primary focus here and, if the two components are of equal magnitude and there is no drift rate variability, then it also predicts that decision outcomes and decision times will be independent of each other.</p><p>Figures 3c and 3d show the combined effects of drift rate variability and of varying the elevation of the drift rate vector above the equatorial plane. As in the circular diffusion model, the primary mechanism for predicting bimodality in the spherical model is drift rate variability, either in the form of a single-component drift rate distribution with a single mean vector or a two-component distribution, one component of which has a mean in the antipodal direction. At moderate levels of drift rate variability the spherical model predicts peaked high-tailed distributions of errors and a slow-error pattern of decision times, like the one shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2e</ref>. At higher levels of drift rate variability the distributions of errors become bimodal and the RTs begin to show a "double-bowed" form, in which the slow-error pattern begins to reverse at the extremes (−π and π rad). This is because the probability mass in the drift-rate distribution is concentrated along the θ = 0 line in the (X 1 t , X 2 t ) equatorial plane. On some trials the sign of the drift rate will be the opposite to its nominal value, leading the process to drift towards the antipodal boundary point. The antipodal component of drift rate allows the model to predict bimodality and also tends to predict faster responses in the antipodal direction, which results in the double-bowing effect. These effects are most evident in the joint distributions of decision outcomes and decision times shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3d</ref>. The two panels in the figure plot the .1, .3, .5, .7, and .9 quantiles of the distributions of decision times on the y-axis as a function of the decision outcomes on the x-axis. The double-bowed pattern is especially apparent in the .9 quantile functions, which characterize the slowest responses in the joint distribution.</p><p>The theoretical interest of the spherical model is that it allows some degree of decoupling or independence between the amount of bimodality and the magnitude of the slow errors and/or double-bowing in the distributions of decision times. The decoupling arises because the elevation of the drift rate vector in the spherical model can vary and controls the relationship between bimodality and slow errors. This contrasts with the circular diffusion model in which the radial component of drift rate variability prescribes a fixed relationship between bimodality and slow errors. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3</ref> contrasts two sets of predictions for the spherical model, one for a drift rate vector with elevation of φ = 0 rad, which lies in the equatorial plane, and another for a drift rate vector with elevation φ = 1 rad (57 deg), which lies above it. For the first set of predictions the drift rate norm was µ = 2.0; for the second it was µ = 3.0, which meant it had a component of µ cos(φ) = 1.63 in the equatorial plane. For both sets of predictions the decision criterion was a = 2.5 with infinitesimal standard deviation of σ = 1.0, and both sets had a component of drift rate variability of η = 2.0 in the radial and the vertical directions. Although the two sets of predictions look similar, the critical difference between them is that the relationship between slow errors and bimodality is reversed. In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3c</ref> (top), φ = 0 leads to a small bimodal effect in accuracy and a large slow error effect in RT <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">(Figure 3c</ref> (bottom) and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3d</ref>). In contrast, φ = 1.0 leads to a larger bimodal effect in accuracy but a smaller slow error effect in RT. This decoupling of the degree of bimodality from the magnitude of the slow error effect turns out to be critical to the model's ability to fit data. As we discuss in the following section, the drift rate norm, which controls the overall speed of responding, can be interpreted as encoding both the information in the stimulus and expressing the decision maker's overall propensity to respond, independent of the criterion setting. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>: Vector field of perceived motion strengths corresponding to µ 1 and µ 2 , the first two components of the drift rate, µ, of the spherical diffusion model. Weak motion strength is associated with short vectors near the center of the circle and strong motion strength with long vectors near its circumference. The norm of the drift rate vector, µ , encodes both the perceived strength of motion and the overall pressure or propensity to respond. The third component of drift rate, µ 3 , decouples the propensity to respond from the information in the stimulus, which is encoded in the projection of the drift rate vector onto the (X 1 t , X 2 t ) plane.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive Content of the Third Dimension</head><p>The third dimension of the spherical model endows it with some properties not shared with the circular model, but raises the question of what, if any, psychological meaning can be attached to it. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kvam and Turner (2021)</ref> identified the third dimension with a multidimensional scaling representation of similarity space and proposed that evidence is accumulated in this space rather than response space. In the case of the RDM task, however, in which the motion is planar, there is no corresponding identification with the structure of similarity space. Rather, as suggested in the previous section, we view the third dimension as expressing the decision maker's uncertainty about the direction of the motion. (We are using "uncertainty" here in <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Pelli's (1985)</ref> sense of intrinsic uncertainty, which characterizes the decision maker's uncertainty about the identity of the stimulus after experiencing it, as distinct from extrinsic or structural uncertainty, which is manipulated by the experimenter, through prior probabilities or some other manipulation.) The substantive part of this idea is that in the spherical model, unlike the circular model, the rate of evidence accumulation can be decoupled from the information in the stimulus. In both models, the norm of the drift rate, µ , determines the rate at which evidence accumulates towards the decision boundary. In the circular model, the drift rate norm represents stimulus information: For a pure noise stimulus, the norm will be zero and the process will be driven by diffusion noise alone and responses will be slow. In the spherical model, the norm represents the decision maker's propensity to respond, irrespective of the quality of the encoded stimulus information. When the stimulus is uninformative, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3b</ref>, the drift-rate vector will be aligned with the X 3 t axis. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, which shows a vector field of motion strengths and directions, elaborates this idea: Weaker motion is represented by shorter vectors associated with points closer to the center of the circle and stronger motion is represented by longer vectors closer to the circumference. The vectors in the figure are a graphical representation of µ 1 and µ 2 , the first two components of the drift rate, µ. The third component, µ 3 , in the X 3 t direction, may vary independently of the other two components and of stimulus information.</p><p>What evidence is there for this kind of decoupling of stimulus information from the decision maker's overall propensity to respond? There are two bodies of the literature that support this idea. One involves the effects of urgency; the other involves the effects of stimulus intensity or value. Urgency has been linked theoretically to the idea that there may be a time cost to sampling evidence and it may be advantageous for decision makers to limit the time they spend on any decision in order not to lose the opportunity to consider other, potentially rewarding, alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Drugowitsch et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Malhotra et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>This idea is especially plausible in situations in which the decision maker is confronted with a sequence of similar decision problems of varying difficulty that must be completed in a fixed time <ref type="bibr" target="#b121">(Starns &amp; Ratcliff, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">2012)</ref>. Biologically, urgency has been linked to a component of neural activity that increases progressively from stimulus onset until the response, even in the absence of stimulus information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Churchland et al. (2008)</ref> identified a component of decision-related neural activity in lateral interparietal area of monkeys performing an RDM task that increased in this way even when the motion was incoherent, which they interpreted as a neural "urgency signal." Several authors have proposed models in which an urgency signal is combined either additively <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Ditterich, 2006)</ref> or multiplicatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cisek et al., 2009)</ref> with the accumulating evidence. Additive representations are more consistent with the finding that urgency can be recorded in the absence of coherent motion; multiplicative representations combine more naturally with a model of the decision process as diffusion between absorbing boundaries.</p><p>Recent theoretical and empirical treatments of these kinds of models can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">Trueblood et al. (2021)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Smith and Ratcliff (2021)</ref>. An alternative to neural urgency is the idea that accumulating evidence races against a (stochastic) internal clock that sets a random internal deadline <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hawkins &amp; Heathcote, 2021)</ref>. The critical idea behind urgency models, however they are formulated, is that the propensity to respond can be decoupled from stimulus information. In the spherical diffusion model, this propensity is represented by the drift rate norm, µ , which can be nonzero, irrespective of the values of its first two components. As in other urgency models, the propensity to respond can be weak or strong, independent of the quality of the evidence in the stimulus. When formulated in this way the model has the attractive feature that there will be an identifiable component of urgency in the evidence entering decision process that is independent of stimulus information, as the neural findings of Churchland et al. suggest it should be.</p><p>The second, related, area concerns the effects of stimulus intensity or value. In both perceptual and value-based decision tasks in which pairs of alternatives are presented, RTs become shorter as the intensity or value of the alternatives is increased while the information, or relative value difference between them, is held constant. The effect has been found in perceptual tasks by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bose et al. (2020)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Polanía et al. (2014)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Ratcliff, Voskuilen and Teodorescu (2018)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Teodorescu et al. (2016)</ref> and in value-based decision tasks by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Fontanesi et al. (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr">Hunt et al. (2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Pirrone et al. (2018)</ref> found monkeys made faster choices between two juice rewards when the alternatives had higher value than when they had lower value, even when the value difference between them was zero. Like urgency, various explanations have been proposed for the intensity/value effect and it is not our aim to try to distinguish between them. One explanation is that the intensity effect implies an independent accumulators model architecture, in which the absolute rather than the relative values of the evidence for the alternatives are accumulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Teodorescu et al., 2016)</ref>. Another is it reflects the effects of selective attention, which boosts the perceived value difference between attended and unattended items <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Shevlin &amp; Krajbich, 2021)</ref>. A third is that an increase in intensity or value is accompanied by an increase in variability, either in drift rate or diffusion rate, which leads to shorter RTs in either instance . Like urgency, the effects of value/intensity imply a decoupling of stimulus information from the overall rate at which evidence accumulates. One way to implement this is in a model like the spherical diffusion model, in which the evidence space is of higher dimension than the response space and in which the drift rate encodes both overall value and value difference and where the overall value determines the propensity to respond.</p><p>Another attractive feature of the spherical diffusion model is that both it and the circular diffusion model may provide a characterization of subjective confidence. There is a rich literature on confidence that is beyond the scope of this article to review and, moreover, confidence judgments can be elicited in different ways, which seem to require different models. We focus on one narrow, but important, part of confidence. In two-choice decision tasks, a question of long standing has been how to characterize subjective confidence using random-walk or diffusion models, in which the decision variable is the relative evidence for the two alternatives. If evidence is accumulated by an independent-increments random-walk or diffusion process, as occurs in the Wiener diffusion process or in a log-likelihoodratio random walk <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Laming, 1968</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Laming, , 1979</ref><ref type="bibr">Bogacz et al. 2016)</ref>, then the posterior probability of a response made at a particular boundary being correct will be constant, regardless of whether the response is fast or slow. Consequently, the accumulated evidence at the time of the response cannot provide a basis for confidence judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Pleskac &amp; Busemeyer, 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Vickers (1979)</ref> argued that the inability of random-walk models to account for confidence made them unattractive as models for decision making for this reason. As an alternative, he proposed a balance of evidence account of confidence, in which evidence for competing alternatives accumulates in separate totals, and confidence is a function of the difference between the winning and losing totals at the time of the response <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Smith &amp; Vickers, 1988)</ref>.</p><p>Subsequent authors have argued that racing accumulator models like that of Vickers may be preferable to the standard diffusion model as models of the decision process because they provide a natural way to characterize confidence via the balance-of-evidence account (Van Zandt, 2015).</p><p>A possible way out of this dilemma is to assume, like the spherical diffusion model, that the dimensionality of the evidence accumulation space is greater than that of the response space and carries more information about the stimulus than just its categorical identity.</p><p>The benefits of this representation are easiest to see in relation to two-choice decisions.</p><p>Lilburn et al. (2019) studied two-choice decisions about grating patches in a visual workingmemory task in which observers judged whether the patches were rotated clockwise or anticlockwise from the vertical. They found that RT and accuracy could be well-described by the standard diffusion model but they also discussed a model in which decisions are made using a circular diffusion process applied to orientation space, in which the response circle is partitioned by decision bounds into regions associated with clockwise and anticlockwise responses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Smith (2019)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Smith and Corbett (2019)</ref> similarly proposed that categorical decisions can be modeled using continuous-outcome processes by partitioning the outcome space -2D in the former case and 4D in the latter -into discrete categories with decision bounds. These kinds of model might be appropriate, for example, for the n-choice RDM tasks studied by van Maanen et el. (2012). An assumption of all of these models is that the decision outcome, as represented by the hitting point of the diffusion process on the response circle, sphere, or hypersphere, represents the decision maker's best information about the identity of the stimulus. This is mapped via an appropriate response rule to a categorical response. Indeed, as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Smith (2016)</ref>, the hitting point on the decision boundary is the maximum-likelihood estimate of the orientation of the drift rate vector and an observer who responds based on the hitting point is a maximum-likelihood observer.</p><p>In Lilburn et al.'s task, the hitting point on the response circle is the observer's best estimate of the orientation of the stimulus relative to the vertical. Unlike the standard 1D diffusion model, in which vertical or horizontal responses are all made with a fixed posterior probability, the circular diffusion model with categorical bounds provides information about the strength of the evidence for a clockwise or anticlockwise response. Hitting points near the clockwise/anticlockwise boundary provide weak evidence for the chosen response;</p><p>hitting points far from it provide strong evidence. The richer representation of decision outcomes in the circular diffusion model potentially provides a way to characterize confidence -namely, as a function of the distance between the hitting point of the process on the decision boundary and the classification bounds that partition the outcome space into response categories. The same idea carries over to the spherical model: The azimuth of the hitting point represents the observer's estimate of the identity of the stimulus; the elevation of the hitting point represents the intrinsic uncertainty about it. The latter may plausibly be related to subjective confidence. Specifically, confidence will be a decreasing function of the distance of the hitting point from the equator: It will be maximal at the equator and minimal at the poles.</p><p>As noted earlier, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bae and Luck (2022)</ref> reported that confidence in the RDM task is higher for responses made in antipodal than orthogonal directions. The spherical diffusion model predicts such a relationship if the azimuthal (µ 1 , µ 2 ) component of drift rate is greater on antipodal than orthogonal response trials. For a given µ , if the azimuthal component of drift rate is large then the polar elevation of the drift rate vector will be small, which increases the probability that the process will hit the response sphere near the equator, which, by hypothesis, is associated with higher confidence. Drift-rate variability along the axis of motion forms part of all of the models we consider here: Large drift rates along the axis of motion increase the probability of responding in both the true and antipodal directions. Consequently, the models naturally predict the confidence relationship reported by Bae and Luck.</p><p>One of the most important empirical relationships that a model of confidence needs to satisfy is that higher confidence is associated with shorter decision times, under conditions of constant stimulus difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Pleskac &amp; Busemeyer, 2010)</ref>. Circular or spherical diffusion models with drift-rate variability naturally predict this relationship. Larger drift rates increase the precision of responding (Equation 3) and also result in shorter decision times. In the Lilburn et al. circular diffusion account of two-choice decisions, increased precision results in fewer responses made near the clockwise/anticlockwise classification boundary and consequently made with low confidence. The model thus predicts an inverse relationship between confidence and decision times. The spherical diffusion model predicts a similar relationship when there is across-trial variability in the azimuthal component of drift rate. If this component is large then the drift-rate norm will also be large. The hitting point on the response sphere will then be near the equator and responses will be made with high confidence. Decision times will also be short, so the model again predicts an inverse relationship between confidence and decision times.</p><p>It is not our aim here to try to evaluate either the circular or the spherical diffusion models as models of confidence. Rather, it is simply to articulate some of the theoretical implications of the idea that the dimensionality of the evidence accumulation and response spaces may be different and to suggest that the third dimension in the spherical model is a theoretically principled construct. We have argued, specifically, that it is not just an ad hoc device that allows the model to fit data but is related to a cluster of constructs that have proven useful in understanding other cognitive phenomena, namely, urgency, overall intensity or value, and confidence, and potentially provides testable predictions in these domains. The existence of these connections means the model is not narrowly paradigm-specific but connects productively with the broader cognitive literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drift-Rate Bias</head><p>Many applications of continuous-outcome tasks, particularly in the VWM literature, have treated the stimulus space as isotropic or homogeneous and have assumed the pattern of responding is the same for stimuli in all parts of the space. More recently, several studies of continuous-outcome color judgments have shown that, rather than being isotropic, responses in some parts of the space -specifically, those associated with nameable colorsare more probable or more precise. These kinds of color category effects have been found in long-term memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Persaud &amp; Hemmer, 2016)</ref>, visual working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bae et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hardman et al., 2017)</ref>, and in perceptual decisions with no delay <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bae et al., 2015)</ref>. Ratcliff <ref type="formula">2018</ref>and  found that responses to preferred colors, as well as being more probable, were also faster. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Blake et al. (1997)</ref> studied memory for dot motion and found strong biases for particular directions of motion. They considered several models to explain such biases, including that people are biased towards the cardinal axes, and concluded there was no common mechanism that could explain the patterns of bias in all participants. Instead, the biases they found were idiosyncratic and person-specific. Smith et al. <ref type="formula">2020</ref>reported similarly idiosyncratic biases in hue judgments in an isoluminant color space (CIELUV space).</p><p>Categorical effects are not our primary focus here, but they occur in all continuousoutcome tasks we have so far studied and need to be incorporated into any model that aspires to completeness. The model for categorical effects we consider here is a variant of the model of Smith et al. (2020), which we have adapted to the spherical diffusion setting. The model assumes that categorical effects in continuous-outcome decisions reflect differences in the rate of evidence accumulation for stimuli in different parts of the 2D space, which are modeled as drift rate biases.</p><p>In the two-choice RT literature, biases in stimulus and response processes have both been studied. Response biases arise when one response is made with less evidence than the other, causing it to be made more rapidly and more frequently, and also more often in error. These kinds of biases are often found when the prior probabilities of the response alternatives are unequal <ref type="bibr">(Dutilh et al., 2019)</ref> and are modeled in the two-choice diffusion model as an offset in the starting point for evidence accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008)</ref>. Stimulus biases arise when evidence for one response accumulates more rapidly than the other, causing it to be made more rapidly and more frequently <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ashby, 1983)</ref>, but not necessarily more often in error. In the two-choice diffusion model, stimulus biases are often implemented using a drift criterion, which determines the relative rates at which evidence for the two alternatives accumulates <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Ratcliff &amp; Smith, 2004)</ref>. The model we consider here, which can be viewed as a continuous-outcome counterpart of a drift-criterion model, assumes that biases reflect differences in the drift rates for evidence accumulation for motion in particular directions. As discussed by , the model was motivated by both pragmatic and theoretical considerations. Pragmatically, it was motivated by the desire to develop a bias model that was compatible with the geometric and mathematical structure of the circular diffusion model. Theoretically, it was motivated by our belief that the dominant kinds of biases in tasks in which accuracy is stressed over speed are stimulus biases rather than response biases. Indeed, Bae (2021) reported a neural decoding study of categorical biases in location and orientation in visual working memory and concluded that they were encoded in the stimulus representations themselves rather than in the way judgments about stimuli are made. The stimulus-bias account of Smith et al. described below is consistent with the kind of biased representation view proposed by Bae. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref> shows the drift-rate bias model of , as implemented in the spherical diffusion model. A stimulus with mean drift rate ν and polar angles θ and φ has a component ν = ν cos(φ) (in reparameterized coordinates) when projected onto the equatorial plane. The drift-rate biases are represented by a set of bias vectors, b i , i = 1, 2, . . ., in this plane. The number, locations, and norms of the bias vectors are assumed to be participant-specific. The component of drift rate in the equatorial plane is the sum of the stimulus-dependent component of drift rate, ν , and its nearest neighboring bias vector, b ' . The vectors add nose to tail in the usual manner of vector addition as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5b</ref>. This relationship has two consequences. First, it means that the evidence accumulation process will be biased in either a clockwise or anticlockwise direction towards the nearest bias vector. Second, when the azimuths of the stimulus and a bias vector coincide, the θ-components of the vectors will be collinear and the norm of their sum will be maximized. Evidence will accumulate more rapidly for such stimuli than would otherwise be the case and the associated RTs will be shorter and response precision will be greater.  reported evidence for effects of this kind.</p><p>The model assumes that the effect of a bias vector located at ϕ on a stimulus located at θ is given by Proj(ν |b ' ), the projection of the stimulus on the bias vector exponentially attenuated by the difference in their azimuths as measured in the 1 − cos(•) circular distance metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Mardia &amp; Jupp, 1999)</ref>.

Responses were made using a Thrustmaster T16000M FCS Joystick.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>In Experiment 1, a 1,000 ms fixation cross appeared after a 1,000 ms intertrial interval, which was followed by a variable-duration stimulus display. After stimulus offset, there was a further 505 ms delay before the appearance of a cursor (a bold "X"), which was the cue to respond. To make a decision, participants moved the cursor in the direction of the perceived motion to a point on a surrounding 5 deg annulus (measured from its inner edge). They were encouraged to make this movement as rapidly and ballistically as possible. The response time was taken to be the time of the midpoint of the movement from the home position to the entry into the response annulus. In Experiment 2, stimuli were presented following an 800 ms period of random noise, using the "seamless onset" manipulation of O'Connell and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kelly, Corbett, &amp; O'Connell, 2021)</ref>. The purpose of this manipulation is to minimize artifacts associated with the stimulus onset in the evoked potential response in order to facilitate identification of a component associated with evidence accumulation. Participants were informed about the timing of the seamless onset manipulation but there were no external cues to indicate when the coherent motion began. The joystick used to record responses in Experiment 2 automatically returned to the neutral position when the participant released it. Pressure on the joystick caused the dots to disappear and a small, square cursor to appear, which showed the chosen direction of movement and remained visible until it had crossed the response circle. RT was taken as the time to initiate the movement (the disappearance of the dots and the appearance of the cursor). RT in Experiment 1 was measured from the occurrence of the response cue, while in Experiment 2 it was measured from the onset of coherent motion. These timing conventions have implications for the estimation and interpretation of nondecision times in the models, as discussed subsequently. To minimize anticipations in Experiment 1, on trials on which the participant moved the mouse within 150 ms after the response cue were flagged with a "too fast" error message and the trial was discarded. In Experiment 2, trials on which the participant moved the joystick during the first 150 ms after the onset of coherent motion were similarly flagged.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mathematical Models</head><p>For both Experiment 1 and 2, we compared four main models: two versions of the circular diffusion model and two versions of the spherical diffusion model. Both versions of each model had across-trial variability in drift rate but one of them also had a mixture of stimulus-centered and antipodal drift rates, like the model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bae and Luck (2019)</ref>. In the models with antipodal drift rates, the mean drift rates were ν and −ν, with probabilities</p><p>(1 − π a ) and π a , respectively. We denote these four models as CIRC(η), CIRC(−ν, η), SPHR(η), and SPHR(−ν, η), respectively. In this nomenclature, the prefix CIRC or SPHR identifies the decision model as circular or spherical, while the arguments identify -in a purely symbolic way -the parameters used to explain bimodality. The η-models seek to explain bimodality through across-trial variability in drift rate alone; the (−ν, η)-models</p><p>seek to explain it through a combination of across-trial variability in drift rate and an antipodal component of mean drift rate. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref> lists the parameters used to fit the models to data.</p><p>To facilitate comparison of the circular and spherical models we parameterized drift rates in both models using the drift rate norm, ν , and also, in the case of the spherical model, the elevation (vertical component), φ, of the drift-rate vector above the equatorial plane. When the circular model is in canonical orientation, the drift rate norm is simply equal to its radial component ν 1 = ν . For the spherical model, ν 1 = ν cos(φ) and ν 3 = ν sin(φ), are the radial and vertical components of drift rate, respectively. The tangential component of drift rate for both models, ν 2 , was not a free parameter but was determined by the drift-rate bias model in Equation 12 and varied with location in the stimulus space. We allowed across-trial variability in the radial component of drift rate, η rad = η 1 , and also, in the spherical model, in the vertical component, η ver = η 3 . We considered the effects of variability in the tangential component of drift rate, η 2 , but, like Smith et al. (2020), we found it did not improve model fit and when it was allowed to </p><formula xml:id="formula_12">µ ∼ (1 − π a )N(µ; ν, η) + π a N(µ; −ν, η),<label>(13)</label></formula><p>where N(µ; ν, η) is a multivariate normal distribution with mean ν and covariance matrix These biases, like those reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Blake et al. (1997)</ref> and , appeared to be idiosyncratic rather than systematic. Our aim here was not to provide a detailed characterization of bias, so we adopted a minimal form of the drift-rate bias model of Equation 12 that was the same for all participants and models, in which there were four bias vectors, b ' , located at angles A ϕ , −π &lt; A ϕ ≤ π, with a common amplitude b ϕ . We The manner in which stimuli were presented in both experiments leads to ambiguity about when evidence accumulation begins and the point from which RT should most appropriately be measured. In Experiment 1, stimuli were presented from 681 ms to 1,281 ms before the clock was started (the sum of the exposure duration and the responsecue interval) but there was a fixed trap for fast errors 150 ms after stimulus offset in all conditions. In Experiment 2, there was 800 ms of random noise prior to the onset of coherent motion. The upshot of these manipulations was that the estimates of nondecision times in the fitted models tended to be shorter than is typically found in diffusion models, which can range from a little under 180 ms to more than 650 ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Kvam, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Matzke &amp; Wagenmakers, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Ratcliff, 2018;</ref>. Our estimates of nondecision times were at or below the bottom of this range of estimates and in many instances were negative, likely because of the way stimuli were presented and RTs were recorded, which meant that some of the nondecision times may have fallen outside the measured response interval.</p><p>Although the interval between stimulus onset and response cue in Experiment 1 varied as a function of exposure duration, the minimum RTs, as indexed by the 0.1 RT distribution quantiles, were largely invariant across exposure conditions. If we interpret these quantiles as the times at which the fastest evidence accumulation processes finish then the invariance of the 0.1 quantile RTs can be interpreted as showing that the onset of evidence accumulation was delayed until presentation of the response cue. There was no evidence of truncation of the leading edges of the RT distributions due to responses made before the 150 ms fast-error trap, even at the longest exposures, suggesting that participants learned to withhold their responses until the response cue. 3 That they can do so has implications for how evidence accumulation is initiated and controlled. <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Smith et al. (2014)</ref> presented a release-from-inhibition model -which they modeled using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with a time-varying decay term that controlled response inhibition -in which the onset of evidence accumulation can be time-locked to an external event like a response cue, which can predict behavior of this kind.</p><p>For Experiment 2, the seamless-onset manipulation means the point at which evidence accumulation began was inherently ambiguous, but may have been as early as 800 ms before the stimulus. The idea that noise may be sampled from the prestimulus field prior to stimulus onset is a well-established one that was proposed to explain fast errors by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Laming (1968)</ref>. This kind of prestimulus sampling can be linked theoretically to the starting-point variability account of fast errors in the two-choice diffusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008</ref>). In the case of the RDM task, a further complication arises from the fact that the processes that extract a perceptual representation of the motion may be slow-acting. Smith and Lilburn (2020) argued, based on the classical visual temporal sensitivity literature and a refit of the data from the blinded collaborative model recovery study of <ref type="bibr">Dutilh et al. (2019)</ref>, that computations of drift and diffusion rates in the RDM task may take place on a time scale of around 400-450 ms. In two-choice decision tasks, these time-varying processes can be modeled using integral equation methods , but drift and diffusion rates in the circular and spherical diffusion models are constant during a trial, as they are in the standard two-choice model. Consequently, these models are</p><p>3 The use of a fast error trap is critical to obtaining delayed evidence accumulation.

Because of these considerations, we elected to model the distributions of RT exactly as they were measured and we denote the estimated nondecision time in the model as T ′ er and refer to it as the residual nondecision time. The terminology is intended to highlight the fact that in both experiments it is probable that some of the nondecision time fell outside the measurement interval and our use of a special symbol to denote the remaining, measured part serves to emphasize this fact. We consider the implications of time-varying stimulus processing in the Discussion.</p><p>In many studies of diffusion models, nondecision time is assumed to vary randomly across trials <ref type="bibr">(Matzke &amp; Wagenmakers, 2009, Appendix A)</ref>. In our initial implementation of the models we also made this assumption, but we found it did not systematically improve fits, so we omitted it from the final models. Typically, the effects of nondecision time variability are most pronounced and the benefits of including it are most evident in speedstress tasks where responding is fast. In two-choice psychophysical tasks in which accuracy is stressed, we have often found that nondecision time variability makes, at most, a marginal contribution to model fit.  omitted it from their study of continuousoutcome color decisions for the same reason we omitted it here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Individual differences There were large individual differences in RT and accuracy in both experiments and in whether or not bimodal error distributions were obtained. Three participants in Experiment 1 showed pronounced secondary modes; the remaining two provided some, equivocal, evidence for secondary modes. Three participants in Experiment 2 showed some evidence of secondary modes, although they were not as pronounced as in Experiment 1. A fourth had heavy-tailed error distributions with no evidence of a secondary mode. The remaining participants were very accurate and did not have heavytailed error distributions. The participants who showed secondary modes are the interesting ones for our purposes and are the ones whom we expected to be most diagnostic in testing between models.</p><p>Fitting the models to data We fit the models to data by maximum likelihood, where the likelihood, L(θ, T ), associated with decision outcome θ and response time T , is L(θ, T ) = dP t (θ T ), where dP t (θ T ) is given by Equation 4, for specified values of the model parameters. To do so, we minimized minus the sum of the log-likelihoods (−LL), where</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">LL = i j log L(θ ij , T ij ),<label>(14)</label></formula><p>for each participant individually using the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm in Matlab (fminsearch). In this expression, θ ij and T ij are the decision outcome and RT for the jth trial in the ith condition, respectively. As discussed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Ratcliff and Tuerlinckx (2002)</ref>, a problem with maximum-likelihood fitting of RT data is the presence of outlier observations to which the model assigns zero likelihood, which can create convergence problems and distort the fit. We dealt with this problem using the procedure of , which assigned a value of L = 0.05 to any observation to which the model assigned zero likelihood (dP t (θ T ) = 0). The effect of this procedure was to downweight the effect of any observation that fell too far from the rest of the data. This stabilized the fitting procedure and avoided the convergence problems to which maximum likelihood is otherwise prone. We compared models using the Akaike information criterion (AIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Akaike, 1974)</ref> and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Schwarz, 1978)</ref>, which penalize models for their numbers of free parameters,</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">AIC = −2LL max + 2m BIC = −2LL max + m log N,<label>(15)</label></formula><p>where m is the number of free parameters in the model and N is the total number of trials on which the likelihood is based. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows the fits statistics for the four models to the data from the individual participants in Experiment 1. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figures 6 to 8</ref> show the fits of the model SPHR(−ν, η) to the data from four of the five participants, which is the best-fitting model in each case.

Selected conditions for the remaining participant are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, which compares the fits of SPHR(−ν, η) and CIRC(−ν, η). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure   6</ref> shows the marginal distributions of decision outcomes and RT for the four exposure  In interpreting the fit statistics in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, the reader is reminded that log-likelihoods can only be compared across models for an individual participant but they cannot be compared across participants. Differences in the log-likelihoods for different participants cannot be used to infer whether a model fits one participant better than another because the summed log-likelihood depends both on the fit and on the variance of the fitted distributions. The latter determines which observations make positive contributions and which make negative contributions to the log-likelihood. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> shows a very consistent pattern of performance of the models across all participants. The spherical models performed better than the circular models and the two-    given azimuth, θ, by varying φ, which allows them to predict a wider range of decision outcomes than do their circular counterparts. When combined with across-trial variability in drift rates, the models predict Q × Q plots that better correspond to those found in data. predicts the slow-error pattern in all conditions, to an increasing degree as the task gets harder.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>The predicted Q × Q functions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref> are not determined solely by the drift-rate variability parameter, η rad , but also depend on the drift-rate bias model, which predicts  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 8</ref>, but the log-likelihood of the resulting model was poorer. We also found that the distribution of decision outcomes for this participant could be better captured qualitatively by a generalization of the model that allowed the elevation of the drift-rate vector, φ, to differ for the veridical and antipodal components of the drift rate. If we view the elevation of the drift-rate vector as being a reflection of the decision-maker's uncertainty about the encoded representation of the stimulus, then the psychological interpretation of this generalization of the model is that people are more likely to mistake the direction of motion within the optic flow field on trials when they are uncertain about the encoded stimulus. This generalization of the model seems plausible to us, but we have restricted ourselves to reporting only the simplest versions of the spherical models, in which there is a single elevation parameter. <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> shows the estimated parameters for the best-fitting model, SPHR(−ν, η). There is substantial heterogeneity in the estimated parameters that reflects the substantial individual differences in the performance on the task, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 6</ref>. For all participants, however, the mean drift-rate norms, ν 1 through ν 4 , varied over a fairly narrow range, consistent with the fact there were only fairly small differences in performance as a function of stimulus duration, despite the large range of durations that we used. For most participants (with the exception of MP5), variability in the radial component of drift rate, η rad , was larger than variability in the vertical component, η ver , which is a reflection of the role played by the radial component in predicting slow errors and double-bowing. The radial component of drift-rate variability and the drift-rate bias model of Equation 12 together determine the shapes of the predicted joint distributions.</p><p>The question of how much of the across-trial variability in drift rates is attributable to stimulus-specific factors like those in the drift-bias model and how much is attributable to endogenous factors like fluctuations in attention and alertness has been debated in both psychology and neuroscience. <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Ratcliff, Voskuilen, and McKoon (2018)</ref> used a double-pass procedure to investigate this question in several different two-choice decision tasks. For most of their tasks, stimulus factors and endogenous factors both appeared to contribute to the estimated drift-rate variance, but for the RDM task, most of the variability was due to differences among stimuli. In the RDM task, the agreement in double-pass performance closely matched the agreement predicted from the estimated drift-rate variance in the diffusion model, but in the other tasks the estimated variance exceeded what would have been predicted if it had arisen from stimulus factors alone. Our results similarly suggest that a substantial part of the across-trial variability in drift rate, as reflected in the shapes of the Q × Q plots, can be attributed to differences in the drift rate for stimuli in different parts of the stimulus space, as indicated by the stimulus-specific error and RT effects in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 8</ref>, which the model attributes to drift-rate biases. However, they do not allow us</p><p>to identify exactly what proportion of drift-rate variability is due to stimulus factors and what proportion is due to endogenous factors in the cognitive system, which would have required a double-pass procedure like the one used by ).</p><p>Because of the uncertainty about when evidence accumulation began relative to when the clock was started in Experiment 1, we allowed the residual nondecision time parameter, T ′ er , to vary freely in the fits and did not impose an a priori constraint that it should be positive. As can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, most of the estimates of T ′ er were small and in all but one instance they were negative. Taken at face value, these estimates imply that evidence accumulation for these participants began before presentation of the cue to respond. As the cue always occurred at a predictable time after stimulus offset and the participants were all highly practiced, this kind of strategic adaptation to the temporal characteristics of the task seems plausible. It is also the case, however, that the criterion estimates, a, in the best-fitting spherical models tended to be larger than those in the circular models, and larger criteria are associated with a rightward shift of the predicted RT distributions, so the associated estimates of nondecision time will then be shorter. Consistent with this, estimates of T ′ er in the circular models tended to be longer than in the spherical models and most were positive, ranging from -0.02 s to 0.09 s. We regard the estimates of T ′ er in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> as reasonable ones given the nature of the paradigm, but to ensure the rankordering of the models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> was not an artifact of compensatory differences in the nondecision times for circular and spherical models we refit the spherical models with T ′ er fixed equal to the estimated T ′ er for the corresponding circular models. The fits worsened a little quantitatively when constrained in this way but the overall qualitative properties of the fits were the same and the picture in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> was unchanged. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> shows the fit statistics for the four models to the individual participant data for Experiment 2. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 10 to 12</ref> show fits of the best model to the marginal and joint distributions of decision outcomes and RT, and the stimulus-dependent signed error and median RT, respectively. In comparison to Experiment 1, RTs in Experiment 2 were longer and the secondary modes, in those cases in which they were found, were less pronounced.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>Two participants (DP1 and DP2) show clear secondary modes; two others (DP4 and DP6)</p><p>show heavy tails, with a hint of a secondary mode in DP6, and the remaining two (DP3 and DP6) were very accurate with no probability mass outside the central region. The long RTs in Experiment 2 were likely due to the seamless onset manipulation, which introduces uncertainty into when the stimulus begins. We suspect that the larger secondary modes in Experiment 1 were due to its greater reliance on visual working memory: The stimuli in Experiment 2 remained present until a decision was made whereas in Experiment 1 decisions were based on memory representations formed during the prior exposure period.</p><p>Apart from the differences in RT, another feature of Experiment 2 that differs from Experiment 1 is the shifts in the leading edges (the .1 quantiles) of the RT distributions in the Q × Q plots in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>. In Experiment 1, the leading edges of the joint distributions showed little change as a function of response accuracy, in agreement with other continuousoutcome data we have analyzed (e.g. . In contrast, for three of the participants in Experiment 2 (DP1, DP2, and DP6) the .1 quantile RTs are shortest for the most accurate responses and become longer as accuracy decreases. Participant DP4</p><p>shows the opposite pattern: The longest .1 quantile RTs are associated with the most accurate responses. The remaining participants do not have a sufficient range of accuracy to allow inferences about the shapes of the .1 quantile functions. We think the shapes of the Q × Q functions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> are likely the result of uncertainty associated with the seamless-onset manipulation. All six participants show a slow error pattern in the upper (.5 to .9) quantiles of the Q×Q plots, but for DP4 in the .1 quantile this pattern is reversed.</p><p>The reversal for DP4 likely reflects premature sampling of the kind proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Laming (1968)</ref>, in which evidence accumulation is driven by noise from the prestimulus display, leading to fast, inaccurate responses on some trials.    Note. m=number of free parameters, bold face denotes the best-fitting model.</p><p>The reasons for the slow errors in the .1 quantiles of DP1, DP2, and DP6 are less clear but we think they reflect the lack of an onset transient in the display to initiate evidence  <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Yantis and Jonides (1984)</ref>, in which discriminative information is carried by the removal of stimulus features rather than their addition, lead to long RTs and reduced accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Sewell &amp; Smith, 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Sewell and</ref> Smith argued that the lack of onset transients leads to inefficiency or imprecision in the allocation of attention, which results in longer RTs -including a shift in the leading edge of the RT distributions -and lower accuracy, and proposed a time-varying diffusion model based on the integrated system model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Smith and Ratcliff (2009)</ref> to account for them.</p><p>We think it likely that the seamless-onset manipulation produces similar imprecision in the allocation of attention, which affects the initiation of evidence accumulation.</p><p>In comparison to Experiment 1, in which the best-fitting model for all participants was the spherical model, SPHR(−ν, η), the results for Experiment 2 were more equivocal.</p><p>Again, the spherical models performed uniformly better than the circular models, but for half of the participants the best model was SPHR(−ν, η), which has an antipodal drift-rate component, and for the other half it was SPHR(η), which has drift-rate variability only.</p><p>This difference corresponds to the patterns of decision outcomes in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>: Participants with a secondary mode were best-fit by a model with an antipodal drift-rate component and those no secondary mode were best-fit by a model without it. Overall, the models do a fairly good job of capturing the diverse and challenging pattern of data represented by the marginal distributions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 10</ref>, the joint distributions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref>, and the stimulus-dependent error and RT effects in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 12</ref>. Like Experiment 1, the best-fitting model with drift bias (either SPHR(−ν, η) or SPHR(η), depending on the participant), provided a better account of the data for all participants according to both the AIC and the BIC.</p><p>Despite the comparatively good fit, the seamless-onset manipulation may have introduced time dependencies into the stimulus encoding process that are not represented in our models. Such dependencies may be particularly pronounced in the RDM task in which there is evidence that temporal integration of the motion signal leads to time-varying drift and diffusion rates . Some of the misfits in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 11</ref> -such as the overprediction of the slow-error pattern for DP6 and the pronounced double-bowing pattern for DP1 -may be a reflection of the limited ability of our models to capture these sorts of time dependencies. Nevertheless, the ability of the models to capture the complex patterns of accuracy and RTs in the individual data is fairly impressive.</p><p>Like Experiment 1, there was a tendency for the best-fitting residual nondecision times to go negative, as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>. As in Experiment 1, negative residual times are not implausible: Psychologically, they characterize an evidence accumulation process that begins before the clock is started and, indeed, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Devine et al. (2019)</ref> found electrophysiological evidence that this occurs with the seamless-onset manipulation. But, as we discussed in relation to Experiment 1, short nondecision times can also be a consequence of fitting a family of RT distributions with models with large decision criteria and, as <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> shows, the decision criteria in the best-fitting spherical models were uniformly large. To ensure that the rank-ordering of the models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> was not an artifact of compensatory differences in the nondecision times for circular and spherical models, we again refit the spherical models with T ′ er fixed equal to the estimates for the corresponding circular models. For five of the six participants the comparative performance of the T ′ er -constrained models was unchanged: In each instance, the spherical models were preferred to the circular models.</p><p>The exception was DP5, for whom T ′ er for CIRC(η) was fairly long (0.148 s). For DP5, the negative log-likelihood for SPHR(η) with T ′ er = 0.148 was worse than the corresponding statistic for CIRC(η) in <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref> (−LL = 66.3), but when we refit it with T ′ er set equal to the mean of the estimates for the circular model, the fit was better than the fit of that model (−LL = 20.3). We conclude that the better fits of the spherical models in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> do not depend on nondecision times being allowed to become negative, because when they are constrained to have the same nondecision times as those in the circular models they continue to do better than them. Those nondecision times are themselves short, but, as we have emphasized, they are plausible in the context of the seamless-onset paradigm in which there is uncertainty about when evidence accumulation begins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Parameter recovery and model identification</head><p>Given the complexity of our models, there is a question of whether, and how well, their parameters can be identified in data. On the one hand, the joint distributions provide a rich and and detailed empirical structure to constrain the estimates; on the other hand, the number of free parameters is large and they enter into the models in a highly nonlinear way.</p><p>To investigate the parameter recovery properties of the model we carried out a simulation study, in which we simulated multiple realizations of the experimental design of Experiment 1 using the Euler method <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Brown et al., 2006</ref>) with a step size of 0.001 s, using the same number of trials as used in the experiment, and using parameters loosely based on those used to fit the data. We focus on the model SPHR(−ν, η), which was the most complex model structurally and had the greatest number of free parameters. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> summarizes the results of this study. The parameters used in the simulation, shown in the caption of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>, resulted in a moderate-sized secondary mode, slightly larger than that in the low coherence condition in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bae and Luck's (2019)</ref> data in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, a dished Q × Q plot with some evidence of double bowing, as shown in the lower panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3d</ref>, and a pronounced category structure. We used a greater range of drift rate norms than we found empirically in order to investigate whether drift rates could be accurately recovered across a range of values, and a positive rather than negative value of T er to investigate whether the negative values in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> were an artifact of the model. The distributions of parameter estimates in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> were based on 25 complete simulations of Experiment 1, which were fit by independently and randomly perturbing each of the generating parameters by ±75% to use as starting parameters in fminsearch. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> As <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref> shows, the parameters were well recovered in the fits to the simulated data, including T er , which did not show any evidence of estimation bias. In all instances, the range of estimated values is narrow, with few outliers, and the medians of the estimates are close to the generating values. There is a slight but systematic tendency for the drift rate norms to underestimate their generating values and a corresponding tendency for the decision criterion also to be slightly underestimated. These estimation biases may be a reflection of the approximation of a continuous diffusion process by a discrete-time random walk, which, on average, must travel further before stopping than the corresponding continuous process <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Smith, 1990)</ref>. In general, however, the parameters of the model were well recovered and there is no evidence of nonidentifiability, which would result in long ridges of equal likelihood in the likelihood surface, in which parameters could be traded off against each other. These kinds of tradeoffs would manifest themselves as large variances in the associated estimates. The only place in which there evidence tradeoffs may have occurred was in the identification of the drift-rate bias vectors A 1 and A 2 . <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure   13</ref> shows the location of the first of these vectors was underestimated and the second was overestimated. As these vectors were only 0.5 rad (29 deg) apart and the effect of the difference between them was smeared by the exponential similarity gradient (α = 2.5), it is unsurprising that these parameters were individually difficult to identify. The marginal and joint distributions and the stimulus-dependent angular error, corresponding to <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure   7</ref>, 8, and 9 (which we have not reproduced), showed there was a close agreement between the simulated data and predictions for the model for all 25 data sets. We carried out a similar parameter recovery study for the model CIRC(−ν, η), which we have not reproduced, using the best-fitting parameters of the circular model to the simulated data from the spherical model as generating parameters, the results of which were at least as good as those in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 13</ref>.</p><p>We also carried out a model identification study to ascertain how well the circular and spherical models were able to reproduce each other's data. We focused on the twocomponent models CIRC(−ν, η) and SPHR(−ν, η) as the better-performing models of each class. To this end, we cross-fit the two models to the two sets of simulated data used in algorithm that parallelized the model across stimulus angles.</p><p>the parameter recovery study. The simulated data for the circular model had marginal distributions of errors and RT and category effects that were virtually indistinguishable from those of the spherical model, but had more deeply-dished and double-bowed Q × Q functions, like those shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>, for the reasons discussed there. When the models were fitted to their own data, the average log-likelihood for CIRC(−ν, η) was −LL = 7, 293 and for SPHR(−ν, η) was −LL = 4, 804. (Readers are again reminded that the relative magnitudes of the log-likelihoods does not show the relative performance of the models because the maximum likelihoods achievable for different data depend on their variances.)</p><p>For the cross-fit models, the average log-likelihood for CIRC(−ν, η) fit to the spherical data was −LL = 5, 586 and for SPHR(−ν, η) fit to the circular data was −LL = 7, 272. At the level of the individual simulations, for all 25 sets of simulated spherical data the model was better fit by the spherical than the circular model according to the log-likelihood, the AIC, and the BIC. For the 25 sets of simulated circular data, the majority were better fit by the spherical model: Eighteen were better fit by the log-likelihood and the AIC; seventeen were better fit by the BIC. The spherical model can predict deeply-dished Q × Q plots like those in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> with small values of the drift rate elevation parameter, φ, that is, with drift rate vectors that are in or close to the equatorial plane. The model identification study confirms the picture obtained from the fits to the data of Experiments 1 and 2. The circular diffusion model cannot easily capture the typical pattern of empirical data in our experiments, which involves a secondary mode, category effects, and a moderately dished or double-bowed joint distribution. The spherical model can capture this pattern, as well as the more extreme Q × Q functions predicted by the circular model. The model identification study shows that the spherical model is appreciably more flexible than the circular model, but this flexibility appears to be necessary and, as we argued previously, it is theoretically principled.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this article we have provided a characterization of the decision processes involved in the continuous-outcome RDM task and a comparison of alternative models of the secondary, "shadow" mode that many participants in this task display. This is not the only setting in which bimodal outcome distributions have been found in continuous-outcome tasks, but it is a theoretically interesting one and provides an important test-bed for models like the circular and spherical diffusion models that do not naturally predict bimodalility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kvam and Turner (2021)</ref>, in their analysis of the relationship between the circular diffusion model and Ratcliff's SDCM, suggested that bimodality could arise if evidence is accumulated in a space that is of higher dimensionality than the response space. Our development of the spherical diffusion model was inspired, in part, by their analysis and by the earlier development of the hyperspherical diffusion model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Smith and Corbett (2019)</ref>. Although <ref type="bibr">Kvam and</ref> Turner showed that a spherical diffusion model could predict bimodal outcome distributions and plausible-looking marginal distributions of RT, they did not consider the joint outcome-RT distributions predicted by their model. As highlighted in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref> here, a model can predict plausible-looking marginal distributions but nevertheless fail badly to account for the joint distributions. We have emphasized the qualitative properties of the joint distributions, as characterized by Q × Q plots, as a primary benchmark that any credible model must account for.</p><p>As well as needing to account for the joint distributions of decision outcomes and RT, we emphasized the importance of accounting for stimulus anisotropies in accuracy and RT -that is, for variations in performance in different parts of the stimulus space. We have shown that a fairly minimal implementation of the drift-bias model of  was able to account for much of the systematic variation in decision outcomes and RT as a function of motion direction, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figures 8 and 12</ref>. The effects of drift-rate bias augment those of drift-rate variability, as represented by the η rad and η ver parameters, and increase the slow-error or double-bowed pattern predicted by the models. Like the standard diffusion model for two-choice decisions, the circular and spherical diffusion models clearly distinguish between within-trial and across-trial variability. Within-trial The need for across-trial variability in evidence-accumulation models has been a subject of ongoing debate in psychology and neuroscience, but the existence of the kinds of stimulus anisotropies that we and others have identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bae et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Blake et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hardman et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Persaud &amp; Hemmer, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Ratcliff, 2018)</ref> clearly shows that this kind of variability will be present whenever data are marginalized or aggregated across stimuli and that its effects need to represented in a complete model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Circular versus spherical diffusion models</head><p>Our primary theoretical contribution in this article has been to provide a formal, mathematical characterization of the spherical diffusion model and to show that the addition of the extra dimension endows it with some properties that may be useful in applications like the one we have considered here. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Kvam and Turner (2021)</ref> conceptualized the extra dimension as being one coordinate of a multidimensional evidence accumulation space, which they related to the multidimensional scaling representation of the stimulus domain, but here, where we are studying planar motion, the stimulus domain is inherently two-dimensional. As we discussed earlier, we consider the extra dimension in the continuous-outcome motion task to be a representation of the decision maker's uncertainty about the encoded stimulus, which could conceivably be related to subjective confidence.</p><p>A number of continuous-outcome tasks, including visual working memory and decisions about noise-perturbed color patches produce peaked, high-tailed distributions of decision outcomes, which are often characterized as a mixture of stimulus-driven and guessing processes.  characterized the heavy tails as reflecting an encoding-failure process, in which the identity of the encoded stimulus is random, and uniformly distributed around the circle. The spherical diffusion model provides another way to represent such processes: The drift-rate vector on encoding-failure trials points towards the north pole, leading to responses that are uniformly distributed around the circle.</p><p>We found that the relative performance of the four models, CIRC(η), CIRC(−ν, η), SPHR(η), and SPHR(−ν, η) depended both on the experimental task and on the individual participant. In Experiment 2, in which the secondary modes were small or absent, the data for five of the six participants could be accounted for satisfactorily by the simplest of the four models, CIRC(η), the circular diffusion model with across-trial variability in drift rate only. The exception was DP1, who showed the largest secondary modes of the six. For DP1, the level of drift-rate variability needed to predict the secondary mode produced a double-bowed pattern that substantially exceeded that in the data. For moderate levels of drift-rate variability, which produce Q × Q plots that resemble the data, the model predicted heavy-tailed distributions of decision outcomes but no secondary modes. These kinds of effects were much more apparent in Experiment 1, where larger secondary modes were found. The simpler circular diffusion models had difficulty in accounting for the data from Experiment 1.</p><p>One of the -to us -unexpected findings was that the circular diffusion model with an antipodal drift-rate component, CIRC(−ν, η), should have difficulty in accounting for these data. As commented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bae and Luck (2019)</ref>, decision-outcome data like those in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref> are readily fit by a mixture of von Mises distributions. However, the need to account for RT data, especially at the level of the joint distributions, greatly increases the theoretical challenge. For these data, the spherical diffusion model with an antipodal driftrate component, SPHR(−ν, η), tended to be the best model. The success of this model is attributable to the additional component of drift-rate elevation, φ, which leads to predicted Q × Q plots that are less obviously double-bowed and more closely resemble those found in the data. Versions of this model provided a fairly good account of all aspects of the data from all of the participants in the two experiments considered here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time inhomogeneous evidence accumulation</head><p>A limitation of our mathematical models were that they assumed that the process of evidence accumulation is time-homogeneous or time-invariant, that is, the drift and diffusion rates remain constant throughout an experimental trial. Like the standard diffusion model for two-choice decisions, the assumption of time-homogeneity is needed to derive the expressions for the joint densities in Equation 4 to 6. In two-choice decision tasks, time-inhomogeneous stimulus representations can be modeled mathematically using  models, there is some evidence that the RDM task may be an exception and may be better characterized using time-inhomogeneous models.  found that the selective influence violations (violations of assumed parameter invariance across experimental conditions) in the two-choice diffusion model in the blinded validity study of the RDM task by Dulith et al. (2019) were reduced when they used a model with time-inhomogeneous drift and diffusion rates with an integration time of around 400 ms. They attributed the time inhomogeneity to perceptual integration by the motion system, which determines the strength of evidence entering the decision process, as distinct from the integration of evidence in the decision process itself.</p><p>Their estimated 400 ms integration time is consistent with estimates reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Holmes et al. (2016)</ref> who modeled decisions about changing stimulus information in the RDM task using a piecewise linear ballistic accumulator model and found that the change in the evidence entering the decision process lagged the stimulus by around 400 ms. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Ratcliff and McKoon (2008)</ref> found that the standard diffusion model provided a good fit to data from the RDM task with appropriately chosen values of nondecision time and nondecision time variability. This is consistent with the analysis of <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Smith et al. (2014)</ref>, who showed that a time-inhomogeneous two-choice diffusion model in which the drift and diffusion rates are proportional to one another behaves like a time-homogeneous model shifted to the right on the time axis.</p><p>These considerations are particularly relevant to the seamless onset manipulation in Experiment 2, in which stimuli were preceded by several hundred milliseconds of incoherent motion. If, as the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Holmes et al. (2016)</ref> and the analysis of  suggest, the drift and diffusion rates in the RDM task depend on the output of a slow perceptual integration process, then the drift rate in the task is likely to be a timevarying function whose initial segment is a mixture of incoherent and coherent motion.</p><p>To evaluate the effects of these kinds of time-inhomogeneities, we simulated the spherical diffusion model with a seamless onset manipulation. A psychophysically realistic model of drift rate would represent it as the output of a linear filter with a long integration time <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Smith, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Smith &amp; Ratcliff, 2009</ref>, but as our concern was simply to evaluate the qualitative effect of time-inhomogeneity on the predictions of the model, we implemented it in a simple way, by assuming that the drift rate norm ramped up linearly from zero to a maximum of µ at time t = 0.4 s. Because there is a seamless transition from incoherent to coherent motion in the experimental manipulation, we assumed that the diffusion rate remained constant throughout a trial. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> shows the results of fitting the spherical diffusion model SPHR(−ν, η) to data simulated from a process with a ramped-on drift rate. We used the same experimental design as we used in the parameter recovery study (i.e., a version of the design of Experiment 1), but with 5,000 simulated trials per condition to provide a finer-grained characteriza-tion of the relationship between the simulated and fitted distributions. The figure shows only the easiest and hardest conditions for compactness because the other two conditions showed the same features. The figure shows that, in agreement with the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Smith et al. (2014)</ref> and the fits of <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Ratcliff and McKoon (2008)</ref>, a time-homogeneous model fits the data generated by a time-inhomogeneous process well. Numerically, the fit is a bit worse than fits of the model to data generated by a time-homogeneous process <ref type="bibr">197</ref> vs. −LL = 1, 686, with the usual caveat about comparing likelihoods across different data sets), but qualitatively there is little to distinguish them. The figure shows that the time-inhomogeneous model does an excellent job of accounting for the marginal and the joint distributions. Because the drift rate in the simulated process was ramped on while the diffusion rate was constant, we expected the early part of the process to be dominated by noise and that there would be discrepancies between the simulated and predicted 0.1 distribution quantiles as a result, but, surprisingly, this was not the case. Rather, all of the quantiles in the Q × Q plot are well-captured by the model. The reason for this counterintuitive behavior is presumably because the model becomes time-homogeneous after 400 ms, and the fastest responses are all slower than this (the empirical 0.1 quantiles are around 500 ms). Consequently, the hitting-time dynamics of the process are essentially those of a time-homogeneous process.</p><p>The most obvious difference between the simulated and fitted models are the estimated parameters. We allowed the nondecision time in the fitted model to be uniformly distributed with range, s t . The nondecision time parameters in the generating model were T er = 0.07 s and s t = 0 s; the estimated parameters in the fitted model were T er = 0.166 s and s t = 0.124 s. Consistent with our earlier observation, unmodeled time-inhomogeneity increases estimated nondecision time mean and variability. These effects are noteworthy, because our nondecision time estimates were uniformly short, which we attributed to evidence accumulation starting before the clock. Any inhomogeneity in the underlying process not represented in the model would tend to act in the opposite direction to this effect and increase the estimated nondecision times. If so, then our model fits might have underestimated the extent to which evidence accumulation began before the clock. Apart from nondecision times, the other aspect of the simulation that merits comment is that the drift rate norms and decision criteria in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> all underestimated their generating values.</p><p>This was also the case in the parameter recovery study, but, at least in the case of the drift rates, the underestimate is greater, suggesting that the model underestimates the rate of evidence accumulation when the early part of the process is time-inhomogeneous. In general, however, the results of the simulation in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 14</ref> are reassuring. Even when the process is time-inhomogeneous in its initial segment, the time-homogeneous model captures its essential structure with a high degree of fidelity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Visual mechanisms of ambiguous motion perception</head><p>We remarked earlier that the success of a model with a mixture of antipodal drift rates suggests the input to the decision process is an opponent-process motion percept of some kind. There are several different models for motion perception in the vision literature that might plausibly produce antipodal motion percepts. Anstis proposed that the perceived dot motion in Julesz stereograms could be mediated by edge detectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Anstis &amp; Mackay, 1980)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Geisler (1999)</ref> proposed they may be mediated by motion streaks on the retina.</p><p>However, one of the most influential is the class of motion energy models, which can be implemented neurally with oriented visual filters <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Adelson and Bergen, 1985)</ref>. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15</ref> shows how a motion energy mechanism, which senses the presence and direction of motion, can be built up from low-level visual filters in this way. As a building block of such a model, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15a</ref> shows a separable spatiotemporal filter, which has a center-surround spatial response function, consisting of an excitatory center and inhibitory flanks, and a biphasic temporal impulse response function. At short times, the center response of the filter is excitatory; at longer times it becomes inhibitory. The temporal response of the surround is the opposite of this. The spatiotemporal response of the filter as a whole is the product of its spatial and temporal response functions, which is summarized by the pattern of plus and minus signs in the rectangle on the left.</p><p>The separable impulse response function in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15a</ref> implements an oriented spatiotemporal filter, that is, a filter whose response has a particular direction in space and time. The pattern of pluses and minuses can be viewed as weights that characterize the kinds of stimuli to which the filter responds. The filter in the figure responds maximally to a patch of positive contrast that moves from left to right at a speed commensurate with the temporal impulse response of the filter. Importantly, however, it also responds to a patch that moves from right to left at the same speed. This problem of "direction blindness" was identified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adelson and Bergen (1985)</ref> and caused them to reject the simple separable filter as a model for motion perception. To rectify the direction blindness of the separable filter, and the related problem that it cannot distinguish a dark patch moving left from a light patch moving right, they proposed that filters be combined in quadrature pairs.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15b</ref>, in a quadrature pair filter, one of the components has an evensymmetric spatial response and the other has an odd-symmetric response. The outputs of the even-symmetric and odd-symmetric components of the filter are squared and summed.</p><p>The resultant sum is a measure of the motion energy in the stimulus and, unlike the sim-ple separable filter of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 15a</ref>, it is sensitive to the presence and direction of motion.</p><p>The appeal of these kinds of models is that they can be synthesized mathematically from simple components that have the same kinds of spatiotemporal response characteristics as cortical cells. Although there are other kinds of motion model, such as Reichardt detectors, which respond to spatiotemporal correlations <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(van Santen, &amp; Sperling, 1984)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Adelson and</ref> Bergen showed that such detectors are formally equivalent to motion energy models.</p><p>For our purposes, Adelson and Bergen's rejected separable spatiotemporal filter is of theoretical interest because its properties are reminisicent of the behavior of the participants in our experiments. The filter is sensitive to the orientation of the optic flow field that characterizes the motion, but is blind to the direction of motion within the field. A plausible model for the visual mechanisms that drive the decision process in our task is a motion energy model in which the individual components of quadrature pairs are noiseperturbed and vary randomly and independently in strength from trial to trial. On some trials only one member of a pair, but not both, respond with sufficient strength to elicit a percept of motion. On these trials, the percept will be ambiguous in precisely the way the data show.</p><p>A related theoretical question addressed by our modeling results concerns how such ambiguous percepts are distributed across trials. We compared models with unimodal and bimodal distributions of drift rates: CIRC(η) and SPHR(η) versus CIRC(−ν, η) and SPHR(−ν, η). The first two models assume that the radial component of drift rate has a unimodal distribution with mean ν rad and standard deviation η rad . On some trials the sign of the drift rate sampled from the distribution will be the opposite to ν rad and the process will drift towards the antipodal point on the response boundary. The other two models assume that on some trials the drift rate is sampled from a distribution with mean ν rad and on others the mean is −ν rad . There was a general preference across experiments and participants for models with bimodal distributions of drift rate. As we remarked earlier, this kind of bimodality suggests that drift rates depend on the outputs of a perceptually opponent-process motion system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Adelson and Bergen (1985)</ref> argued that motion mechanisms are perceptually opponent in precisely this way. They pointed out that it is generally not possible to see leftward and rightward motion in the same place within the same frequency band. In the case of grating stimuli, for example, a pair of sine wave gratings traveling in opposite directions are perceived as flickering in counterphase, suggesting the motion signals cancel each other out. They argued that a plausible general model for motion perception is one in which quadrature-pair filters sensitive to opposite direction of motion are wired together in opponency. When the outputs of these kinds of filters are noise-perturbed, as occurs in the RDM task, for example, the most strongly responding member of such an opponent pair will determine the percept of motion. Our modeling results, which favor models with bimodal distributions of drift rates, are consistent with this kind of opponency. Potentially, then, the shadow mode in continuous outcome RDM decisions may reflect either trial-to-trial variability in the strengths of the responses in the individual components of quadrature pair filters or differences in the outputs of members of mutually-inhibitory quadrature pairs acting in opponency. Consistent with this observation, Bae and Luck (2022) reported a simulation study using an implementation of a motion energy model by <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kiani et al. (2008)</ref> which those authors used to represent neural activity in area MT. Bae and Luck put their stimuli through the model and found the outputs agreed with the empirical data: The highest output was in the true motion direction; the next highest output was in the antipodal direction, and the lowest output was in the orthogonal direction. These results are consistent with the idea that a motion-energy mechanism determines the drift rate in a diffusion decision process.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other kinds of bimodality</head><p>We have considered bimodality in continuous-outcome decisions in the specific and restricted context of the RDM task. However, the issue of bimodality in continuous-outcome decisions is more general than this. It was first raised by <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Ratcliff (2018)</ref> in relation to a comparative-brightness task requiring decisions about which of several Gaussian luminance blobs in an array of random pixel noise was brightest. Ratcliff argued that the SCDM, which involves a race among an infinite array of accumulators, provides a natural way to represent decisions of this kind. While we agree that the SCDM provides a plausible way to model these kinds of decisions, we do not believe they require a race model to explain them as a matter of necessity, any more than do the diverse variety of two-choice decision tasks that have been studied in the cognitive literature. Many two-choice decisions involve a comparison of two stimuli that are both present in a display: Which of two stimuli is the target, or which of them is longer, brighter, or more numerous? Race models, like the leaky competing accumulator model, the dual diffusion model, and other similar models conceive of the decision process in these tasks as a race between separate evidence totals, each representing a response. In contrast, in the standard diffusion model, the evidence entering the decision process is the result of a comparison of the alternatives made prior to evidence accumulation, with the sign of the result determining the direction in which evidence accumulates. Whether there is a single stimulus in the display and the alternatives being compared are cognitive representations in the decision maker's head or the alternatives are both physically present in the display is immaterial to the logical and mathematical structure of the model. We think exactly the same considerations apply in relation to continuous outcome tasks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Ratcliff (2018)</ref> suggested that the drift rate for the circular diffusion model in the comparative brightness task may depend on the vector sum, or average, of the drift rates for the competing stimuli. If so, then the model would predict unimodal distributions of decision outcomes centered on a point somewhere between the two alternatives. However, these predictions rely tacitly on the assumption that the processes that compute drift rates are linear: Even when the decision maker is trying to pick the strongest of two stimuli the linearity of the process will lead to compulsory averaging, resulting in a drift-rate vector that lies between them. In contrast, our theoretical inclination is to view the processes that compute drift rates as inherently nonlinear -plausibly, as following a MAX, or maximum-of-outputs, rule (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Eckstein et al., 2000)</ref> in which the response depends on the largest or the strongest of a set of competing alternatives. MAX-rule dynamics arise naturally in competitive interaction neural architectures, like the competitive interaction model of attention and decision-making of <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Smith and Sewell (2013)</ref> and the related neural model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Cox et al. (2022)</ref>, in which the excitation or activation in one process inhibits all of the other processes in its neighborhood. When these kinds of competitive interactions are controlled by nonlinear dynamics like those analyzed by Grossberg and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Grossberg, 1980)</ref>, then MAX-rule behavior occurs: The most strongly activated unit saturates and the activity of its competitors is suppressed. We think of drift rates in tasks like the comparative brightness task as being governed by these kinds of competitive interaction dynamics. Compulsory averaging is not a feature of systems of this kind and they would not predict drift rates that lie between the alternatives. The two-component drift-rate distribution that we have used to fit our RDM data would most naturally be viewed as arising from winner-take-all competitive interaction dynamics implemented at the neural level. These kinds of nonlinear dynamics are needed theoretically to obtain a single vector-valued drift rate from a population of units that individually signal evidence for a continuous range of response alternatives. In contrast, Ratcliff's SCDM is linear up until the point of response.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this article, we have developed the spherical diffusion model as a model for continuousoutcome RDM tasks and compared it to versions of the circular diffusion model, with and without an antipodal component of drift rate. Mathematically, the spherical diffusion model belongs to the same class of models as the circular and hyperspherical diffusion models and can be analyzed using the same methods that are used to analyze them. In the RDM task, the additional dimension of evidence accumulation in the spherical model can be related theoretically to the decision-maker's uncertainty about the identity of the encoded stimulus. As the elevation of the drift-rate vector increases, the predicted distribution of decision outcomes becomes less concentrated and, in the limit, when the drift-rate vector is perpendicular to the response plane, it is uniformly distributed around the response circle.</p><p>We showed that a version of the spherical model with an antipodal component of drift rate successfully predicted distributions of decision outcomes in the RDM task, including the bimodal distributions found for some participants, and accounted for the shapes of the joint distributions of decision outcomes and RT, as represented by Q × Q plots. When augmented with a drift-rate bias model, which assumes that drift rates vary with the polar angle of the motion stimulus, the model successfully predicted the biases in the signed angular errors of decision outcomes and RT. The additional flexibility of the spherical model endows it with properties that may be useful in other settings beyond the RDM task.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Continuous-outcome random-dot motion task showing secondary mode in the distribution of response errors.

All models could successfully predict the distributions of decision outcomes, including the secondary modes, and the marginal distributions of RT without difficulty. The main challenge for the models, and the principal constraint on them, was also to predict the joint distributions of outcomes and RTs. As discussed previously in relation inFigure 3, all four models tend to predict double-bowed Q×Q functions, to a greater or lesser extent, although, as shown inFigures 7 and 9, the spherical models can also predict a simpler, dished, slow-error pattern in some parts of the parameter space,similar to that predicted by the single-component circular diffusion model with drift-rate variability. Many of the individual Q × Q plots in Figure 7 show evidence of the doublebowed pattern, although the most diagnostic parts of the distribution for identifying these effects are in the tail quantiles of the RT distributions at intermediate decision outcomes, where the data are sparsest, so the effects are unavoidably noisy. The main point of differentiation between the four models is in the magnitude of the double-bow or slow-error pattern they predict.

Single-component models predict large doublebow patterns because their only mechanism for predicting the secondary mode is through variability in the radial component of drift rate, η rad . In order to predict the large secondary modes inFigure 6, η rad must be large, which results in a large slow-error pattern. If there is variability in the radial component of drift rate but not in the tangential component, then a double-bow pattern results. Even when the model has an antipodal component of drift rate, as was the case of the model CIRC(−ν, η), the double-bow pattern typically exceeded that found in the data.In comparison, the spherical diffusion models fared better, because the elevation of the drift-rate vector above the equatorial plane, represented by the parameter φ, gives them an additional degree of freedom. As discussed previously in relation toFigure 3, the center of the distribution of hitting points increases as φ increases and, in the limit, when φ = π/2, the distribution is centered on the north pole. When the hitting points of this distribution are projected down the meridians of equal azimuth to the response circle, a uniform distribution of decision outcomes results. As a result, spherical models can smoothly transition between a uniform distribution and a distribution centered on a</figDesc></figure>

The functions inFigure 6are joint distributions marginalized across stimuli presented at different polar angles with different drift rates. The amount of variation in mean drift rate due to differences in stimuli is controlled by the bias amplitude parameter b ϕ . As shown inFigure 8, a four-vector bias model was able to predict a wide range of different patterns of signed response errors for the different participants. Although the bias model does not capture all of the fine detail of the pattern of response errors as a function of stimulus location, it appears to capture much of the essential structure. Quantitatively, the model SPHR(−ν, η) with drift bias (a bias amplitude parameter b, and four location parameters, A i , i = 1, . . . 4) provided a better account of the data for all participants according to both the AIC and the BIC.Participant MP3 was the least accurate of the participants and the one who showed the largest drift-rate bias effects. The model SPHR(−ν, η) underpredicts the peak of the distribution of decision outcomes inFigure 6, in part because of the large bias effects in These biases contribute a large component of drift rate that varies as a function of the true direction of motion. The distributions of decision outcomes inFigure 6are marginal distributions across a range of drift rates that vary unpredictably in relation to both the true direction and the antipodal direction; consequently, the predicted marginal directions have small peaks.

The quadrature pair filter is sensitive to the presence and direction of motion. Redrawn after E. H. Adelson &amp; J. R. Bergen (1985), Spatiotemporal energy models for the perception of motion.

Software was written in PsychToolbox. The stimuli consisted of moving 10 × 10 pixel white dots, presented within a circular aperture of 4 deg radius, surrounded by a narrow (one pixel wide) 5 deg radius response circle. The dots were generated within an 8 × 8 deg square patch centered on</figDesc><table /><note>, in which each dot is presented for three frames (∼ 35 ms) and then replotted at a new location and the coherence of the motion is determined probabilistically for each dot each time it is replotted. To avoid global perceptual transients when dots are replotted the lifetimes of the individual dots are uncorrelated with each other. The probability that a dot moved coherently was 0.30 in all four exposure duration conditions. There were a total of 50 dots presented within a 5 degree circular aperture and dots that exited the aperture were replotted at random locations at the beginning of the next lifetime to keep the mean dot density constant. Stimuli in Experiment 2 were presented on a 20"2 The ViSage framestore has two modes: native ViSaGe mode and BITS# mode. In native mode the ViSaGe runs asynchronously from the host computer and all aspects of stimulus timing and response recording are handled by the ViSaGe's onboard clock. In BITS# mode, display timing and response recording are handled by the host computer. Experiment 1 was run in BITS# mode because it allows responses to be made using a mouse.</note></figure>
