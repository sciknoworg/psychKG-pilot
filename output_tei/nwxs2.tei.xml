			<abstract>
				<p>Information stored in memory influences the formation of preferences and beliefs in most everyday decision tasks. The richness of this information, and the complexity inherent in interacting memory and decision processes, makes the quantitative model-driven analysis of such decisions very difficult. In this paper we present a general framework that can address the theoretical and methodological barriers to building formal models of naturalistic memory-based decision making. Our framework implements established theories of memory search and decision making within a single integrated cognitive system, and uses computational language models to quantify the thoughts over which memory and decision processes operate. It can thus describe both the content of the information that is sampled from memory, as well as the processes involved in retrieving and evaluating this information in order to make a decision. Furthermore, our framework is tractable, and the parameters that characterize memory-based decisions can be recovered using thought-listing and choice data from existing experimental tasks, and in turn be used to make quantitative predictions regarding choice probability, length of deliberation, retrieved thoughts, and the effects of decision context. We showcase the power and generality of our framework by applying it to naturalistic binary choices from domains such as risk perception, consumer behavior, financial decision making, ethical decision making, legal decision making, food choice, and social judgment.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Memory is widely considered to be one of the fundamental psychological processes at play in decision making, and a large body of work has attempted to characterize the ways in which memory and decision processes interact with each other to influence behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alba et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dougherty et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Goldstein &amp; Gigerenzer, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Johnson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marewski &amp; Mehlhorn, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Schooler &amp; Hertwig, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1973)</ref>. This work spans numerous disciplines, and forms one of the main avenues through which research on human cognition guides practical applications in the social and behavioral sciences. Of course, the study of memory-based decision making is not only important for its practical applications. Memory and decision making form two of the major areas of research on the human mind (see recent reviews in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Busemeyer et al., 2019 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kahana, 2020)</ref>, and integrating models from these two areas within a tractable framework is one of the major theoretical challenges in cognitive psychology today.</p><p>Addressing this challenge has been difficult. Both memory and decision making are highly complex. Each involves dynamic and stochastic processes that operate over the contents of the mind. Combining these processes within a single model whose parameters can be fit to experimental data and be used to make quantitative predictions is non-trivial. Moreover, naturalistic memory-based decisions involve the retrieval and evaluation of complex thoughts that reflect learnt knowledge, past experience, emotion and intuition, as well as sophisticated reasons. In order to model naturalistic memory and decision processes researchers need to first observe and quantify the informational content of these thoughts. This too poses significant challenges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 4</head><p>Consider, for example, the decision prompt "is nuclear power safe?". In order to provide a response, decision makers must retrieve, from memory, information supporting each of the two response options ("yes" or "no"), typically in the form of natural language thoughts (e.g., "it is difficult to dispose of nuclear waste", "nuclear power is a substitute for harmful energy sources like fossil fuels", and "disasters like Chernobyl are always possible"). Decision processes must evaluate and aggregate these thoughts in order to make a decision. Of course, the retrieval of one thought may cue the retrieval of another, and thus memory involves nuanced dynamics that guide and constrain the eventual decision. The goal of the theorist is to model this complex process, but is it not currently clear how this can be done. How can we observe and quantify the content of people's thoughts, formalize the mechanisms that people use to retrieve, evaluate, and aggregate these thoughts, and predict response probabilities, deliberation length, thought content, and other decision variables?</p><p>Fortunately, there have been numerous advances in psychology that can help us solve this problem. One such advance is query theory, which proposes that thought retrieval is sequential and susceptible to feedback effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Johnson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Weber et al., 2007)</ref>. Query theory also offers a powerful experimental paradigm for jointly eliciting memory data (in the form of retrieved thoughts) and decision data, in naturalistic decision settings. In this paper we use the conceptual structure and empirical paradigm offered by query theory as the basis for a quantitative framework for modeling memory-based decisions, such as those discussed in the preceding paragraph.</p><p>Another insight is provided by memory models like search of associative memory (SAM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Raaijmakers &amp; Shiffrin, 1981)</ref>, context maintenance and retrieval <ref type="bibr">(CMR;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Polyn et al., 2009)</ref>, and DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 5 more general cognitive architectures like adaptive control of thoughtrational (ACT-R; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al., 2004</ref>; for ACT-R models of decision-making, see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dimov et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marewski &amp; Mehlhorn, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Fechner et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gonzalez et al., 2003)</ref>. These theories propose that the items retrieved from memory are used to update a dynamic context representation (or alternatively a short term memory store, declarative memory or imaginal buffer, or working memory representation), which guides subsequent retrieval and interacts with other processes in the cognitive system. We assume that this type of context also encodes all decision-relevant information, which allows us to tractably represent the interactions between memory and decision making processes and predict the eventual decision.</p><p>A third key insight for our framework involves the use of sentence vectors, obtained from recent deep-learning-based language models trained on large scale language data <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cer et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Devlin et al., 2018)</ref>. Sentence vectors provide a powerful contemporary extension to wordbased semantic models (see reviews in <ref type="bibr">Bhatia et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lenci, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mandera et al., 2017)</ref> by accommodating nuances in meaning in natural language sentences. We illustrate the value of these vectors by using them to quantify and cluster semantically related thoughts, and subsequently model sequences of retrieved thoughts.</p><p>By combining the above insights, we are able to build a tractable computational framework for studying naturalistic memory-based decisions. Our framework integrates numerous existing models of memory and decision making, and can be used to quantitatively predict how people think and decide, as well as how various contextual factors alter these thoughts and decisions. We illustrate the power, generality, and tractability of our approach, by using it to fit 576 distinct memory and decision models to data from multiple experiments DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 6 involving eight different psychological domains. Our fits reveal the precise set of memory and decision mechanisms at play in our experiments, and we illustrate the importance of these mechanisms with a wide range of qualitative and quantitative tests. In doing so we provide a useful computational approach for formally specifying and testing the psychological substrates of everyday judgment and decision making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Background</head><p>Judgment and decision making involves the subjective evaluation and integration of information to generate a discrete (e.g., choice) or continuous (e.g., rating) response. Models in this field try to characterize mental processes at play in the evaluation and integration of information <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Busemeyer et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Oppenheimer &amp; Kelso, 2015)</ref>. Heuristic models, for example, are algorithmic rules which simplify the evaluation and integration process (relative to rational models that use all available information 1 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gigerenzer &amp; Gaissmaier, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Payne et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Simon, 1956)</ref>; sequential sampling models are stochastic processes that aggregate information over time, typically until a decision threshold is reached (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bhatia, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Busemeyer &amp; Townsend, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lee &amp; Cummins, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Roe et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Turner et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2004)</ref>; and connectionist models are dynamical systems that describe decision making as the outcome of spreading activation processes in units of interconnected neurons <ref type="bibr">(Glöckner &amp; Betsch, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Holyoak &amp; Simon, 1999)</ref>. Many of these models also make predictions about the specific information that is sampled and used in the decision, which can be <ref type="bibr">1</ref> Although of course using all available information might not be adaptive or resource-rational <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Payne et al., 1988)</ref>.</p><p>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 7 tested using eye-tracking, mouse-tracking, or thought-listing "process-level" data <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Schulte-Mecklenbeck et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>There is also a rich body of research in psychology that formally models the complexities inherent in memory search (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kahana, 2020</ref> for a recent review). For example, models of free recall, such as the search of associative memory (SAM) and the context maintenance and retrieval models (CMR) specify the processes at play in the retrieval of previously presented information, and can describe whether or not certain items are retrieved from memory, as well as the order in which they are retrieved and how previously retrieved items cue subsequent recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin, 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Hintzman, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Murdock., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Polyn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Raaijmakers &amp; Shiffrin, 1981)</ref>. Related research on semantic memory search describes retrieval dynamics when information is not presented explicitly prior to recall (but rather is stored in memory after years of past experience) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Abbott et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hills et al., 2012)</ref>. Most of the above memory models characterize representations for items in memory using semantic spaces built on word cooccurrence statistics in large-scale language data <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jones &amp; Mewhort, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997)</ref>. Such spaces specify words and concepts as high-dimensional vectors, and quantify the semantic relatedness or association between pairs of words or concepts using distances between words in the semantic space (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jones et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lenci, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mandera et</ref> al., 2017 for reviews).</p><p>Our goal in this paper is to build a framework that can combine models of memory search (which specify the dynamics of information retrieval) with models of decision making (which specify the dynamics of information integration) in order to quantitatively model the cognitive processes and information content involved in memory-based decision making. Although there DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 8 have been many insightful models of memory and decision making proposed previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bhatia, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dougherty et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Goldstein &amp; Gigerenzer, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hertwig et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Juslin &amp; Persson, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Thomas et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">von Helversen &amp; Rieskamp, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Stewart et al., 2006)</ref>, most of these do not specify the nuances of the retrieval dynamics involved in this process (as pure memory models do for free recall and memory search), and do not attempt to explain how retrieved information is dynamically aggregated by decision makers to determine choice (as pure decision models do in preferential choice). In addition, these models are typically applied to abstract decision tasks, and are unable to specify the content of the information that is retrieved from memory in more naturalistic decisions.</p><p>One exception involves models within the ACT-R framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al., 2004)</ref>. ACT-R provides a powerful approach to (1) modeling retrieval processes that operate on declarative memory, and (2) specifying their interactions with control processes that determine subsequent actions. Such actions include memory probes to obtain further information, logical rules for reasoning, and motor actions to indicate responses. In the domain of decision making, ACT-R based models have been used to implement a variety of decision strategies and evaluative processes that aggregate information in different ways, addressing different paradigms and settings that require high-level judgment and decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dimov et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fechner et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Link &amp; Marewski, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Link et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marewski &amp; Mehlhorn, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Marewski &amp; Schooler, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Schooler &amp; Hertwig, 2005)</ref>. At the core of these models is the use of intermediary cognitive buffers (either the retrieval buffer for the declarative memory module or the imaginal module) to represent dynamically evolving task-relevant information. Information that is retrieved from declarative memory is placed into these buffers, DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 9 and various production rules operate on the content of these buffers to guide deliberation. With this approach it is possible to describe multiattribute decision heuristics like take-the-best, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dimov et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marewski &amp; Mehlhorn, 2011)</ref> and also specify their relationship with the decision environment and other task-relevant variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Marewski &amp; Schooler, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Schooler &amp; Hertwig, 2005)</ref>. This work is also important in its use of ecological data (e.g., natural language statistics) to model the accessibility of items in memorythis allows for the application of the models to certain types of naturalistic decision problems involving real-world concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Marewski &amp; Schooler, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Link &amp; Marewski, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Link et al., 2016</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anderson &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schooler 1991 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Goldstein, 2002)</ref> Another important theoretical framework relevant to this paper is query theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Johnson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Weber et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hardisty et al., 2010)</ref>. Query theory attempts to describe the role of memory search in naturalistic judgment and decision tasks. It proposes that responses in these tasks are generated by sequentially querying memory for knowledge, experience, emotions, or reasons relevant to the decision. These queries yield a sequence of thoughts, which determine the decision maker's final response. Crucially, thoughts that are retrieved earlier on influence the retrieval of subsequent thoughts, and contextual cues (such as primes, emotions, or endowments) can bias the decision by altering the thoughts that are the first to be retrieved. The thoughts that lead up to a decision can be observed through query theory's experimental paradigm, which asks decision makers to list the thoughts that come to their mind as they deliberate, and to stop listing thoughts as soon as they have made a decision. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Johnson et al. (2007)</ref> showed that, in a standard endowment effect paradigm, sellers (as opposed to buyers) tended to (a) list more thoughts supporting high valuation of their endowment, and (b) list such thoughts earlier in the DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 10 sequence, and (c) these tendencies predicted higher valuations of the endowment. Similar studies have been conducted to explain asymmetric discounting in intertemporal choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Weber et al., 2007)</ref>, and the effects of attribute framing on consumer choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hardisty et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>This list of retrieved thoughts in the query theory paradigm is analogous to the list of words or concepts retrieved in standard free recall and memory search tasks 2 . Thus, in this paper, we use memory models of recall dynamics to describe the cognitive processes at play in thought retrieval. We likewise apply extensions of semantic space models that are commonly used to describe memory search, to quantify the content of the thoughts over which memory processes operate. We combine these memory mechanisms with established decision models, that describe the cognitive processes involved in integrating information provided by retrieved thoughts into a response. We do this using a dynamically evolving context representation of the type used in the CMR and SAM memory models <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Polyn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Raaijmakers &amp; Shiffrin, 1981)</ref>. As with ACT-R models of decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dimov et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marewski &amp; Mehlhorn, 2011)</ref> we assume that context holds both memory and decision-relevant informationretrieved thoughts enter context, and influence both the retrieval of subsequent thoughts and the formation of decision variables used in evaluation and response generation.</p><p>An important assumption of ours is that memory and decision making not only interact through context, but that they interact only through context. This allows us to model memory and decision processes as being conditionally independent on context, and specify these processes using distinct modeling components that can be separately fit to data. We demonstrate the value of this assumption, and the resulting tractability of our framework, by fitting 576 distinct memory-based decision models to thought listing and decision data obtained from the query theory experimental paradigm. Our switchboard analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Turner et al., 2018)</ref> sheds light on the best combination of memory and decision mechanisms for characterizing naturalistic memorybased decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Framework Decision Task</head><p>We examine decision prompts involving eight different naturalistic decision domains:</p><p>risk perception, consumer behavior, financial decision making, ethical decision making, legal decision making, food choice, decisions about well-being, and decisions about society and culture. We deliberately selected questions that were not likely to elicit homogeneous responses across participants and questions for which individuals would not display a strong pre-potent bias (as with ideologically and politically charged questions), both of which would drastically reduce the role of online memory search and decision dynamics.</p><p>Following query theory's experimental paradigm (illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), each trial presented participants with a decision prompt (e.g., "Is nuclear power safe?"), and then asked them to list the thoughts that came to their minds as they deliberated. Participants were asked to use separate text boxes for separate thoughts and to list the thoughts in the order in which they occurred. They were asked to stop listing thoughts once they had made a decision, and proceed to a subsequent screen in which they recorded their decision. This decision involved selecting one of two response options (e.g., "yes" or "no") based on their subjective preference or belief.</p><p>Finally, after the decision had been made, participants were asked to rate each of their thoughts, DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 12 on a 7-point scale, based on how strongly the thought supported one of the response options over the other.</p><p>Experiments 1a-h elicited decisions in each of these eight domains, without attempting to manipulate participant responses. Experiments 2a and 2b used explicit primes to bias participant thoughts and eventual decisions. Here, half the participants were first asked to list a reason supporting the "yes" response (e.g., why nuclear power is safe) and the other half were first asked to list a reason supporting the "no" response (e.g., why nuclear power is not safe). After listing these reasons, participants were allowed to deliberate freely, and, as in the first eight experiments, were asked to list their thoughts in the order in which they occurred, and select their preferred response once they had made a decision. The decision prompts, associated response options, number of analyzable participants, and basic descriptive statistics of thoughts and choices in these ten experiments are displayed in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Overall, these ten experiments involved 2,433 participants listing a total of 13,101 thoughts. The upcoming methods section has additional details about experimental methods and procedures for these experiments. The supplemental materials also present the results of an additional experiment (Experiment 3), in which each participant was given all eight questions from Experiments 1a-h. This experiment was conducted to test whether the results of Experiments 1a-h persist on the individual-level. We do not discuss this experiment and its results in detail in the main text.</p><p>In addition to a final decision, these experiments give us, in each trial, a sequence of unique natural language thoughts and quantified supports for each listed thought. We can write a thought sequence as [q1, q2, … qT], where qt is the t th listed thought and T is the total number of thoughts listed by the participant. The supports for these thoughts can similarly be represented in DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 13 a T length vector <ref type="bibr">[s1, s2, … sT]</ref>. We have st in the set {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}, with larger st indicating that the t th thought has higher support for the first response option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thought Clusters</head><p>Memory processes influence decisions by determining the content of decision-relevant thoughts and the sequence in which they are listed. Thus, in order to model memory search in memory-based decision making, we need to be able to apply memory models to predict the thought sequences, [q1, q2, … qT], generated by participants in our experiments. However, unlike recall sequences in established memory paradigms (e.g., list recall of words or semantic memory search of concepts in a given category), the set of listed thoughts in our experiment is large and unconstrained, with each thought being a unique draw from a seemingly infinite thought space.</p><p>In order to build tractable memory models of thought sampling, we (1) use pre-trained computational language models that take string representations of sentences and compute fixedlength real-valued vectors, and (2) apply k-means clustering to these vector representations to group thoughts into a smaller, finite number of discrete clusters. As a simplifying assumption, we treat the memory process as operations over the discrete thought clusters, and use the thought cluster recall sequences to fit different memory models to our data. We make this simplifying assumption because it is hard to describe and fit stochastic processes over a high dimensional continuous space. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> In the discussion we return to this issue and related issues concerning the representation of our thoughts, and the processes operating on these representations.</p><p>3 It may theoretically be possible to model memory processes as operating over the finite set of distinct thoughts listed in our experiments. Practically, however, this is intractable, and also has various additional limitations. The vast majority of listed thoughts are unique, and therefore we cannot estimate base rates for each individual thought given the frequency of the thought in our dataset. It is also worth noting that our clustering solutions help us pool semantically identical thoughts that nonetheless have slightly different wording (e.g., "nuclear</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 14</head><p>To obtain vector representations of our thoughts, our primary analysis relies on the transformer version of Google's Universal Sentence Encoder <ref type="bibr">(USE;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cer et al., 2018)</ref>, which is a deep neural network which learns to produce sentence vector representations so as to perform multiple natural language processing tasks, from predicting arbitrary running text to question answering. We use this model instead of alternatives, like the Deep Averaging Network version of USE or recent models like ELMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Peters et al., 2018)</ref> and BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Devlin et al., 2018)</ref>, as the transformer-version of USE achieved state-of-the-art performance on sentence similarity benchmarks without additional fine tuning of the USE network (at the time of writing the manuscript). We optimize for performance on sentence similarity so that clustering groups sentences that a human would find similar in meaning.</p><p>Models like USE that deliver sentence vectors can be seen as an evolution of earlier models that compute vectors for words, like LSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Landauer &amp; Dumais, 1997)</ref>, BEAGLE <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Jones &amp; Mewhort, 2007)</ref>, Word2Vec <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Mikolov et al., 2013)</ref>, or GloVe <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref>, based on the patterns of co-occurrence among words in large corpora. The advantage of using models like USE to obtain sentence vectors, over simply, say, averaging word vectors in a sentence, is that models like USE will take into account the order and identity of all words within a sentence when computing a vector. Obviously, the order of words within a sentence, and not just their identity, is a critical component of the meaning of the sentence (cf. "Nuclear power is better than fossil fuel" vs "Fossil fuel is better than nuclear power").</p><p>waste is hard to dispose" and "it is hard to dispose of nuclear waste"). It will be hard to avoid this kind of issue if we consider thoughts individually without clusters. The use of clustering also allows us to model the behavior of new participants whose listed thoughts are not in the set of thoughts listed by prior participants (as is the case for Experiments 2 and 3). These new thoughts can essentially be categorized into the preexisting clusters, and base rates and other parameters for these preexisting clusters can be used to predict new participants' responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 15</head><p>Note that our use of thought vectors and, more generally, spatial representations of semantic content, is purely practical. Such vectors do not (yet) offer a complete cognitive theory of language learning, linguistic compositionality, or semantic representation. Rather, these vectors are merely methodological tools for quantifying the rich and unconstrained set of thoughts that are sampled from memory in naturalistic decision tasks.</p><p>Our use of such models is also partially inspired by how semantic space models have been used in past research in memory and decision-making. Besides modeling word similarity and relatedness judgments, word vectors can model semantic memory search, list recall, free association, and more (for review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Jones et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lenci, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Mandera et al., 2017)</ref>. Though the details of these tasks vary, generally the distance between two word vectors in the semantic space predicts the probability that one word will cue the recall of a second. In much the same way, we will use distance between clusters of thoughts derived from sentence vectors in the thought space to model the probability of one cluster cuing the recall of another during thought listing.</p><p>Once we have obtained vectors for each thought via the USE, we use thought support ratingsthe ratings participants give to indicate which answer (if any) each thought supportedto separate thoughts into three sets, one for the first response option, one for the second, and one for neutral thoughts that support neither response. We then apply k-means clustering to the thoughts belonging to each set so that we obtain separate clustering solutions for first-response indicates the specific cluster that the t th thought is drawn from. In our analysis we consider k = 2, k = 3, and k = 4 k-means clustering solutions for thoughts in the first and second-response sets (we do not cluster thoughts in the neutral set because relatively few sentences are rated as being neutral). This yields a total of 5, 7, or 9 thought clusters over which we assume memory processes can operate. In the main text we will present analysis with the k = 3 cluster solution (corresponding to 7 thought clusters), and in the supplemental materials we repeat our analysis with the k = 2 and k = 4 cluster solutions. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context</head><p>By clustering thoughts into mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups we transform the unconstrained thought listing data obtained from the query theory experimental paradigm into a form that can be described using standard memory models (which are typically applied to the recall of a small number of items). Note that there are important quantitative relationships between thought clusters, such as semantic congruence (the degree to which two thought clusters DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 17 have similar semantic content) and decision congruence (whether or not two thought clusters support the same response). Memory models are able to describe the effect of semantic similarity, temporal contiguity, and source congruence on the dynamics of word recall, and can, for this reason, also be used to characterize the effect of semantic congruence and decision congruence on thought cluster sampling. Likewise, decision models are commonly used to describe discrete choice data, which is identical to the type of binary response data we obtained in our experiments. Additionally, our experiments also elicit lists of support ratings for the thought sequences generated by participants. Support lists quantify the sequence of information that is integrated by the decision maker, and can be used to flexibly model the dynamic properties of the decision process (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Busemeyer &amp; Rapoport, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lee &amp; Cummins, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lee et al., 2019)</ref>. Now, different memory and decision models can be built and applied separately to thought listing or decision data, but how can we combine these models within a single cohesive framework that simultaneously describes memory sampling and decision making? Our solution to this problem relies on the idea of context, taken from the context maintenance and retrieval family of memory models <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Howard &amp; Kahana, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Polyn et al., 2009)</ref>. Particularly, we assume that all decision-relevant information known by the decision maker at time t is stored in a dynamic context variable Ct. Ct evolves with each memory sample, and determines both memory sampling and decision making. Note that we are using the term "time" to refer to the discrete memory sampling steps that lead up to the decision, and not the continuous response time data that memory and decision models are sometimes fit on. Due to the complexity inherent in the DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 18 thought sampling and thought listing process, we will not be modeling continuous response time data in this paper.</p><p>The crucial feature of our data is that we are able to observe the set of sampled thoughts and supports, and are thus able to specify Ct for any point in time during deliberation. As Ct is the cognitive intermediary between memory sampling and decision making, we can use Ct to derive the probabilities of the observed memory sample or decision at t, using existing memory or decision models. Additionally, as the memory samples and decisions do not interact through any other cognitive variables, the probabilities of the observed memory sample and the observed decision at t are conditionally independent given Ct . Conditional independence allows us to separate the probabilities predicted by the memory and decision models, and thus fit memory and decision processes to our data individually, facilitating a tractable modeling solution.</p><p>Context is not only a practical assumption. It also offers a theoretically principled approach to describing the effect of situational variables, such as primes, cues, emotions, choice sets, and reference points. Such variables have been shown to bias judgments and decisions by altering memory (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Weber &amp; Johnson, 2009</ref> for a review), and are easily understood through the lens of memory context. In Experiment 2 of this paper, we explicitly prime participants with thoughts supporting or opposing a decision (as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Johnson et al., 2007 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Weber et al., 2007)</ref>. That is, we ask subjects to first list a thought supporting one choice option, and then allow them to list thoughts and choose of their own volition. By assuming that these thought primes influence memory context at the start of the decision, we can quantitatively model their effect on thought recall, and subsequently characterize their downstream influence on the decision.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 19</head><p>Note again that although our implementation of this idea involves the CMR model, and the use of the term context, a nearly identical implementation could involve the SAM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Raaijmakers &amp; Shiffrin, 1981)</ref>, in which memory and decision-relevant information would be stored in a short-term memory store. Closely related proposals have also been made within the ACT-R framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dimov et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fechner et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Link &amp; Marewski, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Link et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marewski &amp; Mehlhorn, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Marewski &amp; Schooler, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Schooler &amp; Hertwig, 2005)</ref>. In such models, memory and decision relevant information are stored in the buffers of different modules (e.g., declarative memory or imaginal), and such an architecture could also be used to mimic our framework. Context, more generally, can be seen as a type of short-term storage or working memory buffer, widely used in models of memory and related cognitive processes (see, Oberauer, 2009 for a discussion). To keep things simple, and to ensure maximum compatibility between our approach and leading models of memory dynamics, we use the terminology and modeling architecture of the CMR rather than the more elaborate architecture of approaches such as ACT-R.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Illustration</head><p>Our framework uses memory models to study how participants generate thought cluster sequences [r1, r2, …, rT], and how this depends on previously sampled thought clusters and the semantic and decision congruence relationships between them. It also uses decision models to predict the final responses, and how they depend on the sequence of supports, [s1, s2, …, sT],</p><p>emitted by the sampled thought clusters. choosing the first response option, choosing the second response option, or continuing deliberation by sampling another item from memory. The third layer ("Context") contains all decision-relevant information stored in context. This information is divided into two separate parts, with the first representing previously sampled thought clusters, and the second representing the aggregated supports (i.e., preferences or beliefs) generated through these samples. In the illustration shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>, decision makers are asked "is nuclear power is safe?". We assume that they have a total of K = 5 thought clusters and that the two response options are "yes" and "no".</p><p>The decision begins, at t = 1, with some context C1 and the (implicit) decision to sample memory based on this context. This results in the second thought cluster being sampled. The thought sampled from this cluster has support s1 = -2 (indicating moderate support in favor of the second response, "no"), and generates a context representation C2 that encodes this cluster and the degree of support offered by this thought sample. At t = 2, the decision maker uses C2 to make a decision: choose one of the two response options or keep deliberating. In our example, the decision maker decides to continue deliberating. Thus, at t = 2, C2 determines the next memory sample, cluster 3, which offers support of s2 = +2 (indicating moderate support in favor of the first response, "yes"). Once again, context updates, forming a new representation, C3. C3</p><p>encodes a (potentially decayed, as they are in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>) representation of the two previously sampled clusters and their supports, and determines the decision, at t = 3, to continue deliberating. C3 subsequently generates the memory sample at t = 3. In our illustration, the first DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 21 thought cluster is sampled, which offers s3 = -3, and context is updated to C4 to encode this sample and the aggregated supports. These supports then cause the decision maker to choose the second response option, "no", at t = 4, ending deliberation.</p></div>

In the settings modeled in this paper, this information takes the form of aggregated supports. Below, we will allow for the representation of separate aggregated supports for each of the two response options, or for the representation of a single relative aggregated support favoring the first option over the second. We will also allow for the aggregation of continuous supports or discrete supports (which indicate whether or not a response is supported by a thought, but not the magnitude of this support). Decisions will also be allowed to depend on internal decision thresholds or exogenous time limits. Finally, as with the DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 22 memory models, we will allow for different assumptions regarding the decay of support information in context, including full decay, no decay, and partial decay.</p><p>Together the above assumptions will help us explain patterns in our experimental data, such as the finding that retrieved thought clusters cue the retrieval of other semantically related thought clusters as well as other thought clusters that support the same response (findings that, to preview, are visualized in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). They will also help us model how and when aggregated support is used to make a decision (Figures 7 and 8; to preview, time limit models, for example, cannot account for the clear observed dependence of stopping on aggregate decision support).</p><p>With the correct combination of modeling assumptions (revealed through fits of our memory and decision models to participant data) we will be able to quantitatively predict response probabilities, deliberation length (i.e., number of thoughts sampled), thought content (i.e., the specific thought clusters sampled) and other key memory and decision variables. Crucially, bestfit models would also allow for the prediction of priming effectsthat is, how the manipulation of starting thoughts alters the dynamics of retrieval and the eventual decision.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Structure</head><p>At each point in time t the decision maker has the choice of selecting one of the two response options and terminating deliberation, or of sampling memory and continuing deliberation. These decisions are made based on context Ct and we write the probability that the decision made at time t is xt, given context Ct, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">[ | ].</formula><p>If memory is sampled, the decision maker can sample one of K thought clusters. This again depends on context, and we write the probability that the thought cluster sampled at t is rt, given context Ct, as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[ | ]. Note that [ | ]</formula><p>is itself conditional on the decision maker deciding to sample memory at t, though we omit this conditional from our notation for expositional convenience.</p><p>Now, for each subject we observe a sequence of memory samples [r1, r2, … rT]. We also observe a final decision. The final decision can equivalently be seen as a sequence of T decisions to keep sampling memory, each of which yields a thought cluster sample, followed by a decision to end deliberation at T + 1. This sequence can be written as <ref type="bibr">[x1, x2, … xT+1]</ref> where xt is the decision to keep sampling if t &lt; T + 1, and xT+1 is the response option eventually chosen by the participant. With this structure, ∏ (</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">[ | ] • [ | ]) =1</formula><p>captures the probability of observing the T thought clusters that are sampled during deliberation, each of which follows a decision to keep sampling memory. Likewise,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[ +1 | +1 ]</formula><p>captures the probability of ending deliberation and selecting the chosen response after the T th thought cluster sample. Thus together, we can write the probability of our observation as</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">∏( [ | ] • [ | ]) =1 • [ +1 | +1 ]<label>(1)</label></formula><p>This, in turn, can be rewritten as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">∏ [ | ] =1 • ∏ [ | ] +1 =1<label>(2)</label></formula><p>Equation 2 describes the probability of our observation as a function of separate memory and decision components, which are predicted by separate memory and decision models.</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Specifically, ∏ [ | ] =1</formula><p>is the probability of observing [r1, r2, … rT], predicted by a given memory model.

In other words, once we know about the value of context at a given time t (Ct), knowledge about recall at that time (rt) provides no further information about the decision at that time (xt) and vice versa. For this reason, memory and decision models can be fit to our memory and decision data separately, as long as they appropriately specify how context influences memory or decision making. As these assumptions pertain to the elements of the sampled thoughts and support that are retained in context, our empirical paradigm allows us to observe the context specified by a given decision model. Thus, despite Ct being a random variable (that depends on the sampled thoughts and supports prior to t), we ultimately know the realization of Ct that guides recall, rt, and decision,</p><p>xt, at time t. This is why we omit Pr[Ct] from the above equations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Memory Mechanisms</head><p>We assume that context encodes a representation of previously sampled thought clusters, and that this representation determines subsequent memory samples. The most general way of quantifying this representation at time t is with a K x t-1 matrix Mt of indicator variables, with K specifying the total number of thought clusters, and cell (k, l) of Mt specifying whether or not the k th thought cluster was sampled at time l (1 if it was, 0 otherwise). As time progresses, columns can be added to Mt, with values based on the sampled thought clusters. As only one thought cluster can be sampled at any given time, the values in each column must sum to 1.</p><p>Although such a general representation may be useful for implementing complex memory search rules, we assume, for simplicity, that the Mt can be replaced with a K length </p><formula xml:id="formula_10">vector mt = Mt • αt.

If ωS is negative and ωD is positive, then decision makers are likely to sample thought clusters that are semantically related or support the same responses as the thought clusters sampled previously (note that S captures semantic distances between thought clusters). specifies an additional weight that can be directly placed on the activations captured by mt. Intuitively indicates the degree to which clusters stored in context are likely to be resampled (controlling for the high degree of semantic and decision congruence that a cluster has with itself). If &lt; 0, then cluster resampling is less likely, reflecting a type of recall inhibition or repetition suppression. Although we do observe recall inhibition and repetition suppression in simple memory (and attention) tasks, our more complex DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 27 tasks may also reveal &gt; 0, reflecting a tendency to fixate on a thought once it has been recalled. Thus, we use a more general term, cluster resampling, to refer to .</p><p>Finally, the probability of sampling a given thought cluster is obtained by passing At through a softmax function, which is a link function used in multinomial logistic regressions and neural networks.

This probability depends only on the memory decay weight parameter, δM, the semantic and decision congruence parameters, ωS and ωD, the cluster resampling parameter, ωR, and the K baseline cluster sampling parameters γ = [γ1, γ2, …, γK].</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision Mechanisms</head><p>We assume that context encodes a representation of previously sampled thought cluster supports, and that this representation determines the decision made at a given point in time. The most general way of quantifying this representation at time t is with a t-1 length row vector of support Ut, whose l th entry specifies the support emitted by the thought cluster sampled at time l.</p><p>These supports are in the set {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}, with positive values indicating support for the first response. As time progresses, cells are added to Ut, with values based on the sampled thought clusters.</p><p>Although such a general representation may be useful for implementing complex decision rules, we consider a number of different ways of simplifying the information stored in Ut. One way is to assume that decision makers do not encode continuous supports, but rather DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 28 encode discrete supports Vt = sign(Ut). This corresponds to a heuristic decision strategy that ignores the magnitudes of supports offered by each sampled thought.</p><p>Another way of simplifying contextual representations involves aggregating the components of Ut or Vt into a single measure of the support for a given response option.</p><p>Particularly, we can assume that decisions are made based on a scalar ut = Ut • βt or a scalar vt =</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Vt • βt. Here βt is a t-1 length vector [(1-δD) t-2 , (1-δD) t-3 , (1-δD) t-4 , …, (1-δD) 0 ] of decay weights,</formula><p>with δD in range [0,1]. ut and vt are representations of the relative support for the first response option compared to the second response option, that additively combine the supports emitted by all sampled thoughts, with higher weights for recently sampled thoughts. ut and vt evolve dynamically as thought clusters are sampled. If the support of the thought cluster sampled at t is st then ut and vt can equivalently be written as ut = (1-δD)•ut-1 + st and vt = (1-δD)•vt-1 + sign(st).</p><p>A variant of the above assumption involves using separate representations for each of the response options that only aggregate sampled supports that are in favor of the corresponding response option. In order to implement this assumption, we first generate U 1 t = max(Ut,0), U 2 t = max(-Ut,0), V 1 t = max(Vt,0), and V 2 t = max(-Vt,0). Here each maximum operator is applied to each element of Ut, Vt, -Ut, or -Vt, and places a floor of 0 on that element's value. We then define</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">u 1 t = U 1 t •βt, u 2 t = U 1 t •βt, v 1 t = V 1 t •βt and v 2 t = V 2 t •βt</formula><p>to specify the aggregated supports in favor of each response option. u 1 t, for example, corresponds to the (time-weighted) sum of all sampled supports that favor response 1. If the support of the thought cluster sampled at t is st then u 1 t can equivalently be written as u 1 t = (1-δD)•u 1 t-1 + max(st,0).</p><p>Finally, we need to make assumptions regarding the rules used to make a decision at each point in time. There are two types of rules that we consider. The first uses a threshold mechanism DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 29 to select one of the two response options if the aggregated supports (plus an additive error) exceed a threshold value. We write this threshold value as τ, and the normally distributed error at time t as εt ~ N(0,σ). Thus, the decision maker selects the first response option at time t if ut + εt &gt; τ (or vt + εt &gt; τ) and selects the second option at time t if ut + εt &lt; -τ (or vt + εt &lt; -τ). If neither of these two conditions are satisfied, the decision maker decides to continue deliberation and sample another thought cluster from memory. This threshold mechanism can also be applied to u 1 t and u 2 t, with εt ~ N(0,σ) specifying the additive noise applied to these two variables. Here the first response option is selected if u 1 t + εt &gt; τ and u 2 t + εt &lt; τ, and the second response option is selected if u 1 t + εt &lt; τ and u 2 t + εt &gt; τ. If neither of these conditions is satisfied the decision maker continues deliberation and samples another item from memory. An analogous decision rule can</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">be used for v 1 t and v 2 t.</formula><p>Another type of decision rule involves sampling for a fixed number of time steps, T, i.e., sampling until a time limit T is reached. We implement this time limit assumption by assuming that there is a fixed probability of continuing deliberation, λ, after each thought sample. With this assumption, T follows a Geometric distribution. At T, the decision maker selects the first response option if uT + εT &gt; 0 or vT + εT &gt; 0, and selects the second response option if uT + εT &lt; 0 or vT + εT &lt; 0. In the case of separate support representations, the decision maker selects the first response option if both u 1 T + εT &gt; 0 and u 2 T + εT &lt; 0 (or both v 1 T + εT &gt; 0 and v 2 T + εT &lt; 0). It selects the second response option if both u 1 T + εT &lt; 0 and u 2 T + εT &gt; 0 (or both v 1 T + εT &lt; 0 and v 2 T + εT &gt; 0). If these two conditions are not satisfied (i.e., if the accumulators are both positive or both negative) then the decision maker selects each option with a 50% probability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 30</head><p>Note that the assumptions regarding the noise terms above resemble those used in standard accumulator models, like drift diffusion processes or leaky accumulators. However, unlike these models, we do not aggregate the errors over time in ut, vt, and the other decision variables. Thus ut+1 does not depend on εt (and is instead a deterministic function of the supports sampled prior to t), and εt can be interpreted as the noise in retrieving aggregate supports (or equivalently, the noise in setting a decision threshold). This greatly simplifies our modeling task without restricting the explanatory scope of our model. Overall, this and the other assumptions discussed above allow us to analytically derive the probability of the decision maker choosing one of the two response options, or deciding to sample an additional thought cluster, at each point in time. For example, if we assume decision makers aggregate continuous relative supports, ut, to a threshold τ, then decision probabilities are simply given by the probability of ut + εt exceeding τ or -τ. Specifically, if the decision maker selects the first response option at time t, we</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">obtain [ | ] = 1 − ( − ),</formula><p>where F is the cumulative distribution function for a normal distribution with standard deviation σ. In contrast, if the decision maker selects the second response option at t, we obtain [ | ] = (− − ), and if the decision maker selects neither response option (and instead continues sampling thoughts), we obtain</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">[ | ] = ( − ) − (− − ).</formula><p>In the case of the accumulation of discrete relative supports to a threshold, the above equations simply replace ut with vt. When we have the accumulation of absolute supports, these equations are modified to calculate the probability that one accumulator surpasses the threshold while the other doesn't. Finally, in the case that decision makers use a time limit instead of a threshold, the decision probabilities are given by the probability that the time limit has or has not been reached by a particular point in time (which depends on the probability of continuing DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 31 deliberation at each time point, λ), and the probability of the accumulators being in favor of the first or second response option when the time limit is reached (which again is given by the CDF of the normal distribution, with threshold 0).</p><p>By using the above steps to calculate each of probabilities that enter ∏</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">[ | ] +1 =1</formula><p>, the decision component of Equation 2, we can analytically derive the probability of observing a sequence of T decisions to keep sampling memory followed by a decision to end deliberation at T + 1 and select the response option chosen by the participant, given the support ratings associated with each sampled thought. This probability depends only on (1) the decision decay weight parameter, δD, (2) whether or not the decision maker accumulates continuous supports or discrete supports, (3) whether or not the decision maker uses a relative accumulator or a discrete accumulator, (4) on the threshold (τ) or time limit (λ) parameters describing the decision rule, and (5) the standard deviation of the noise (σ) at each point in the decision.</p><p>Note that the reason why we allow different decay rates for memory and decision making is for computational tractability. If we constrained these decay parameters to be the same, then the conditional independence assumption would no longer hold. Of course, by separately fitting the two decay rates we are also permitting the special case in which they are identical. Our bestfit parameters (shown below), however, reveal that these decay rates are not identical, implying that our assumption is not only useful for computational tractability, but also facilitates superior model fits.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relationship with Existing Models</head><p>The model mechanisms summarized in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> are inspired by existing theories, and appropriate combinations of model mechanisms are capable of perfectly instantiating or closely approximating these theories. As discussed earlier, our assumption of context as the key cognitive intermediary guiding memory and decision making is taken from established memory models, such as CMR, SAM, and ACT-R <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Polyn et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Raaijmakers &amp; Shiffrin, 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al., 2004)</ref>. Subsequently allowing for semantic congruence (ωS &lt; 0) and partial context decay (0 &lt; δM &lt; 1) allows our framework to mimic the semantic contiguity properties of these models. Such models also often allow for some decay in context (CMR), baseline or baselevel activation of items in memory (SAM and ACT-R), as well as the possibility of noisy retrieval (CMR, SAM, and ACT-R), as is the case above. Conversely, assuming full context decay (δM = 1) restricts the memory process so that only thought clusters sampled at t -1 influence cluster sampling probabilities at t. This is capable of mimicking the behavior generated by a random walk in a semantic network (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Abbott et al., 2015)</ref>. 4 Decision congruence is a key component of query theory, and thus ωD &gt; 0 allows our framework to capture the essential memory mechanisms underlying this theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Johnson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Weber et al., 2003)</ref> 5 . Of course, turning all the mechanisms off and setting (ωS = ωD = ωR = δM = 0) generates independent sampling over time, which is the implicit assumption in many memory-based decision making models such as the associative accumulation model <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bhatia, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>On the decision side, we assume that supports are aggregated in either relative (ut or vt) or absolute (u 1 t and u 2 t or v 1 t and v 2 t) accumulators. When combined with the threshold decision rule and no context decay (δD = 0), the relative accumulation assumption yields a standard discrete relative evidence accumulator (one of the baseline models in <ref type="bibr">Busemeyer &amp; Rapoport, 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lee &amp; Cummins, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gluth et al., 2012)</ref> and with some modifications, a discrete version of the popular drift diffusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998</ref>). In the case in which we use discrete supports, vt, our framework mimics the core assumptions of the dynamic decision-by-sampling model <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Noguchi &amp; Stewart, 2018</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Stewart et al., 2006)</ref>. Conversely, threshold decision making and partial context decay (0 &lt; δD &lt; 1), combined with the absolute accumulation assumption, generate a discrete leaky accumulator (such as that used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Usher &amp; McClelland, 2001</ref>; also see <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bhatia, 2013 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Roe et al., 2001)</ref>. Note that many practical tests of these models have used an exogenous time limit mechanism (instead of threshold decision making).</p><p>These tests can be captured by replacing the threshold decision rule with the time limit decision rule in our framework.</p><p>If we assume full context decay (δD =1) our models no longer accumulate supports.</p><p>Rather, at each point in time, decisions are made based only on the support sampled in the previous time period. This is a feature of a number of heuristic models of decision making. Thus, for example, we obtain decision processes similar to the lexicographic heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fishburn, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gigerenzer &amp; Goldstein, 1996)</ref> with discrete support, relative accumulation, and a very small threshold, as long as we have full context decay. Continuous support with a slightly larger threshold in the presence of full context decay gives us decisions resembling the lexicographic semiorder heuristic <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Tversky, 1969</ref>) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Lee &amp; Cummins, 2004</ref> for an early application of this idea). Of course, both the lexicographic and lexicographic semiorder heuristics assume that attributes are sampled in a particular order, and thus a perfect implementation of these heuristics within our framework would require appropriate restrictions to the thought-generating process as well (this could be accomplished with appropriate baseline sampling biases and strong negative cluster resampling effects, combined with no context decay and no semantic/decision congruence effects).</p><p>Finally, permitting a long enough exogenous time limit or a large enough threshold, along with no context decay, allows us to model the weighed additive decision rule, in which the decision maker has enough time to sample every thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Keeney &amp; Raiffa, 1993)</ref>. Here, using discrete supports instead of continuous support allow us to capture simplifications of this rule, such as the tallying heuristic (which only considers which option is better or worse on the sampled attribute, without taking into account the strength of each piece of evidence; Gigerenzer <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">&amp; Goldstein, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Russo &amp; Dosher, 1983</ref> Our framework is related to theories that integrate retrieval dynamics with response dynamics in domains such as categorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cox &amp; Shiffrin, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Hockley &amp; Murdock, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Nosofsky &amp; Palmeri, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Ratcliff, 1978)</ref>, as well as ACT-R-based models of memory and decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dimov et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fechner et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Link &amp; Marewski, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Link et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marewski &amp; Mehlhorn, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Marewski &amp; Schooler, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Schooler &amp; Hertwig, 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Theoretically, many of the high-level architectural details are shared with these other models, though of course we do not implement evaluation mechanisms that are more relevant to categorization than decision making (e.g. exemplar-based rules in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Nosofsky &amp; Palmeri, 1997)</ref> or mechanisms that would be necessary to relate our processes to other cognitive systems (e.g. production rules that use visual data to update working memory, or use working memory to output motor responses, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dimov et al., 2019)</ref>.

Unlike all prior work we attempt to characterize the retrieval and evaluation of complex thoughts in high-level judgments and decisions, and are able to observe (and fit) the sequence of retrieved thoughts using participant data observed with the query theory experimental paradigm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited a total of 2,433 participants (Age: M = 32 years SD = 12, range = 18 -76; 47% female) from Prolific Academic for Experiments 1a-h and Experiment 2. We limited our data collection to participants who were from the U.S. and fluent in English, and had an approval rate above 80%. Participants were only allowed to participate once, and earned a base payment of $1.35. 50% of participants were given a bonus worth 50% of the base payment for listing clear thoughts. Participants received the bonus if they were in the top half of participants listing the most thoughts, although, critically, participants were not explicitly told that this was the criterion for bonus payment (subjects were instead incentivized to provide clear thoughts).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 38</head><p>For Experiments 1a-h, participants were randomly assigned to two of the eight questions 6 such that an approximately equal number of participants completed each question. For Experiments 2a and b, participants were assigned to only one question ("Can money buy happiness?" or "Is nuclear power safe?"), and were randomly assigned to first list a thought supporting choice 1 or a thought supporting choice 2. See <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> for all eight questions and possible responses. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates the order of tasks in our survey. Participants first engaged in the thought listing task. They were told to list all thoughts that came to mind as they considered a particular question, regardless of their eventual answer. They were also told that they should list thoughts in the order that they come to mind, and that their thoughts be complete</p><p>English sentences understandable to a third party. We required participants to list at least one thought consisting of at least two words (two strings of characters separated by a space). After this, participants made their response, and then rated each of their listed thoughts in terms of support for the two response options, on a 7-point Likert scale from "Supported {choice 1} a great deal" to "Supported {choice 2} a great deal". Finally, participants indicated their age and gender.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data Pre-processing</head><p>Due to an error in programming the survey for Experiments 1c and 1h, 13 and 10 subjects, respectively, did not record thought supports for one or more of their thoughts in these two experiments. We excluded all such participants (in alternative analyses we do not report; we simply deleted such thoughts but retained the participants; this does not qualitatively alter our results). We also excluded all participants in Experiments 2a and 2b who did not follow the priming instructions (e.g., first listed a thought supporting choice 1 even though they were told to first list a thought supporting choice 2), which led to 37 participants (of 252) and 37 (of 253)</p><p>being dropped from Experiments 2a and 2b, respectively.</p><p>As is standard when using USE and other sentence encoders, we did not remove stop words, nor did we lemmatize or case-standardize the words in our thoughts. Raw thoughts were thus passed through the transformer version of the Universal Sentence Encoder to extract 512dimensional, real-valued vectors for each thought. For each of the eight questions in Experiment 1, we then separated thoughts into three groups, one each for those supporting the first choice, the second choice, and neither choice. We performed separate k-means clustering on thoughts supporting the first choice, and thoughts supporting the second choice, using Scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Pedregosa et al., 2011)</ref>. Thus, if k=2, we have five clusters (two for thoughts supporting the first choice 1, two for the second choice, and one for neutral thoughts) 7 . These clustering solutions obtained from Experiment 1 were reused in Experiment 2 (and Experiment 3; see supplemental materials). Additionally, to enable us to quantify the effect of semantic congruence in memory sampling, for a given question and value of k, we calculated the Euclidean distance between every pair of cluster centroids. The centroids were extracted through functionality provided by Scikit-learn. In general, the centroid of a cluster should of course simply be the mean of all the thought vectors assigned to that cluster (with minor differences between the mean and the centroid if the clustering algorithm stops before fully converging).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative Analysis</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Data</head><p>The choice probabilities of the first option are summarized in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. Participant responses were evenly distributed across the two responses options (the most uneven distribution is in Experiment 1e, in which 67% of participants chose a burger over salad). Note that in Experiments 2a and 2b participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In condition 1, participants were asked to begin by listing a thought supporting the first option, whereas in condition 2, participants were asked to start with a thought supporting the second option. We combined participants of both priming conditions for most of the following analyses, except for the last result section, where we report results regarding priming effects.</p><p>Each participant listed as many thoughts as they wished before a decision was made (although participants were forced to list at least one thought). Distributions of the total number of thoughts sampled by a participant are illustrated in the top row of <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Each panel corresponds to an experiment. The median participant listed between 4 and 6 thoughts, and the modal number of thoughts ranged from 3 to 6, depending on the experiment. We elaborate on the model results visualized in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> in the section Describing Data. For now, we just point out that the primary model assumes absolute accumulation towards a threshold with partial context decay, the relative model assumes relative accumulation towards a threshold with partial context decay, the time limit model assumes a time limit mechanism instead of threshold accumulation, the full decay model assumes absolute accumulation with full context decay, and the no decay model assumes absolute accumulation with no context decay</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 41</head><p>Thoughts generated by all participants in an experiment were clustered based on their semantic similarity and supporting response type. Here we report the results of the k = 3 clustering solution (in the supplemental materials we repeat our analysis with the k = 2 and k = 4 cluster solutions). With three clusters for thoughts in the first-option set, three clusters for thoughts in the second-option set, and one cluster for all neutral thoughts in an experiment, this solution leads to seven clusters in total for each experiment. The top row of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> illustrates the proportion of each thought cluster, with panels corresponding to different experiments. There was some variability in the shares of the seven thought clusters. Some clusters were highly infrequent, making up less than 10% of the data, whereas other clusters described more than 25%</p><p>of participant thoughts (if each cluster was equally likely to be sampled, we would observe cluster frequencies of 1/7 = 14.3% in our data). Again, we save greater discussion of the model results in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> for the section Describing Data, and for now just point out that the primary model is one with semantic and decision congruence and partial context decay but no cluster resampling, and the others are the same but with one or both of semantic and decision congruence turned off.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Memory Patterns</head><p>The memory models described above predict a number of different qualitative patterns in thought cluster recall. For example, non-zero values of ωS, ωD (and ωR) yield thought sampling that is non-IID (independent and identically distributed) over time; thought clusters that are congruent with the previously sampled thought, semantically or decision-wise, are more/less likely to be recalled. If ωS = ωD = 0 (and ωR = 0) then we would not observe the memory dynamics predicted by these models. Note that semantic congruence is a feature of many DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 42 previous memory models, such as CMR, SAM, and ACT-R, as well as models that describe memory search as a random walk in a semantic network. Likewise, decision congruence is a feature of query theory. Our experiments test for the magnitude of these effects in a memorybased judgment task. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> illustrates how sampled thought clusters at time t relate to the clusters sampled at t -1. Again, these figures use the k = 3 k-means thought clustering solutions for each experiment. In the left panel, the asterisks describe the mean Euclidean distance between the cluster centroids of two sequentially sampled thought clusters in our observed data, averaged across participants. In the right panel, the asterisks describe the probability of sampling a thought that supported the same response option as the previously sampled thought, averaged across participants. These are our measures of semantic and decision congruence respectively.</p><p>Did participants sample congruent clusters at an above-chance level? To answer this question, we need to control for participant heterogeneity, i.e., the possibility that thoughts generated by a participant may be more congruent with each other, compared to those generated by different participants. Participant heterogeneity can lead to the appearance of semantic and decision congruence on the aggregate level, and it needs to be controlled for using permutation analysis. For our permutation analysis, we randomly reordered the thought clusters retrieved by each participant and computed the average of the mean Euclidean distance between two sequentially sampled clusters among participants. We repeated this 10,000 times to calculate the average semantic congruence measures, and 95% confidence intervals, that would be observed if participant heterogeneity was the sole determinant of semantic congruence. We performed a similar analysis for decision congruence. The solid dots and error bars in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> illustrate these DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 43 statistics. As can be seen, most asterisks lie below the 95% confidence intervals around the average permuted semantic congruence statistic, indicating that on a participant level, thought clusters sampled next to each other were more semantically related (had less semantic distance) than thought clusters sampled with longer time in between. Likewise, most asterisks lie above both the error bars for the average permuted semantic decision congruence statistic, indicating that, with individual heterogeneity controlled for, contiguously sampled thoughts were more likely to support the same option, compared to thoughts sampled further apart.</p><p>Note that the above patterns also emerge with the k = 2 and k = 4 cluster solutions, as shown in the supplemental materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision Patterns</head><p>The decision models discussed in the previous section also predict a number of different qualitative patterns in our support rating and decision data. For example, models that assume that decision makers use threshold decision rules predict that the probability of terminating the decision and choosing a given option increases as the accumulated (absolute or relative) support for that option increases. Conversely, models that assume that decision makers accumulate information until a time limit is reached predict that the probability of terminating the decision is insensitive to the accumulated support (though the response option that is eventually selected does depend on accumulated support). Models that do not assume any accumulation at all (i.e., have full context decay), such as the lexicographic semi-order heuristic, would predict that response probabilities depend only on the support sampled in the previous time period (and not on the supports sampled in earlier time periods).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 44</head><p>Some of the above patterns can be observed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 7 and 8</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the probability of continuing deliberation (upper panel) or selecting the first option (lower panel), as a function of the cumulative support for the first relative to the second option until that point in time. Here we can see that the probability of continuing deliberation decreases in the magnitude of cumulative support, consistent with the predicted patterns of threshold models and contrary to the predicted patterns of time limit models. Likewise, the probability of selecting the first response option also depends on cumulative support, even as cumulative support increases above +3 (which is the maximum support that can be emitted by a single thought sample). This suggests that decision makers are aggregating support over time, contrary to the predicted patterns of models that assume full context decay (these models would predict that cumulative support beyond +3 would not influence response probabilities, as decision makers cannot aggregate the supports emitted by more than a single thought cluster). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows the probabilities of these decisions as a function of the number of thoughts generated. That is, we calculated participants' probability of continuing deliberation (upper panel), or choosing the first option (lower panel), after sampling a certain number of thoughts. Again, we see that the probability of continuing deliberation decreases, and the probability of selecting an option increases, as the number of generated thoughts increases (the bottom panel of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref> shows that the probability of selecting the first option increases, but note that the probability of selecting the second option increases as well, since the probability of continuing deliberation declines). This pattern contradicts the simulated patterns of full context decay models. Without accumulating supports, the probability of making any decision should be independent of the number of thoughts previously sampled.</p></div>

On the memory side, we can see that the best-fit models display both semantic and decision congruence in memory, except in Experiment 1e, whose best-fit model has semantic congruence turned off (ωS = 0) 8 .

This is not surprising, as the effect of cluster resampling overlaps with that of semantic and decision congruence (resampling from a same thought cluster corresponds to sampling from a decision-congruent cluster with zero semantic distance).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Describing Data</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Choice Probability</head><p>Our framework provides quantitative descriptions regarding participant responses in the types of naturalistic memory-based decision tasks in Experiments 1a-h and 2a-2b. We begin by examining choice probability. Here we used the posterior distributions of the decision parameters, as well as the support ratings generated by each participant. Note that we do not have support ratings for the thoughts that would have been generated by participants had they continued deliberating past their decision, and thus cannot model the dynamics of the (hypothetical) decision process past the point of choice. We address this limitation by considering our predicted posterior probability of the participant's choice at the time of choice. If this probability is greater than 0.5, we say that our model predicts that the corresponding option is chosen. If not, then we predict a 50-50 choice of the two options. <ref type="figure">Figure 11</ref> displays the accuracy rates of our model predictions with this assumption. In the upper panel it displays the 10 The inconsistency between estimated decay rates in the memory and decision models requires some justification at the level of cognitive processing. Assuming context decay in both memory and decision making offers a theoretically cohesive perspective on capacity limits in our paper (in addition to integrating the assumptions of CMR memory models and leaky integration decision models), however differences in parameters between the two decays indicate that despite their architectural similarities, memory and decision context may involve separate implementations. This could be due to differences in the types of evidence that these mechanisms store, and the types of computational goals that these mechanisms optimize or adapt to. Relatedly, decay rates may not be the same because activation levels are not identical across clusters and decision accumulators (cluster activations are at most 1, whereas accumulator activations can exceed 1).</p><p>accuracy rate for the first option and in the lower panel it displays the accuracy rate for the second option.</p><p>Across the ten experiments, our primary decision model, which assumes absolute accumulation of discrete supports towards a threshold with partial context decay, achieved an averaged accuracy rate of 84.6% (minimum accuracy of 74.7% and maximum accuracy of 93.4%) when predicting the choices of participants that selected the first option. We compared these accuracy rates to those generated by four model variants. The first variant assumes relative accumulation towards a threshold, the second assumes relative accumulation with time limits (this model variant fits observed data better than a model that assumes absolute accumulation with time limits as shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>), the third assumes full context decay, and the fourth assumes no context decay. The remaining assumptions of these models are identical to those of the primary decision model. The accuracy rates of these models are 84.5%, 84.0%, 79.8%, and 86.1% respectively. Likewise, for participants that selected Option 2, our primary model achieved an accuracy rate of 74.7% (minimum 59.3%, maximum 87.9%), and the four model variants achieved accuracy rates of 75.3%, 75.4%, 72.8%, and 73.1% respectively. Note that accuracy rates are slightly lower for participants that selected the second option, because a small portion of participants selected the second option without listing any thoughts supporting that option. We speculate that this may be due to a combination of order effects that influence thought listing (i.e., by cuing thoughts that support the first option) and decision noise (that subsequently cause the second option to be chosen). <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> displays the posterior predictive distribution of the number of thoughts generated by each participant in each experiment, based on our model fits. Note that to simulate the number of thoughts sampled before a decision, we need parameter values from both the memory model and the decision model. Here we used posterior distributions of the primary memory model parameters to simulate the cluster sampling process. At time 1, the primary memory model samples a thought according to the baseline activation strengths of the seven clusters ( ); at time 2 onwards, it samples a thought cluster according to the baseline activations, as well as decision and semantic congruence parameters ( and ), and context decay parameters ( ). At each time point, we simulate a decision (select one of the two options or continue sampling) based on the primary decision model parameters. This way, our memory model and decision model, when combined together, can simulate human-like memory search and decision. Here we present results based on 12,000 rounds of simulations using posterior distributions of parameters. Like before, we compare the performance of our primary decision model, to four other model variants. Recall that these variants are the same as the primary model, except that they assume relative accumulation towards a threshold, relative accumulation with a time limit decision rule, full context decay, or no context decay, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of Thoughts</head><p>From <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref> we can see that the predicted density plots from the primary model resemble the observed plots rather closely, showing that our primary model is able to capture not only choice probabilities but length of deliberation (analogous to response time measures in cognitive decision research) as well. Across the ten experiments, the primary model makes the most accurate description of modal number of thoughts, as evaluated by mean absolute deviation across experiments (MAD; primary: 0.9; relative: 3; time limit: 3.2; full decay: 3.2; no decay:</p><p>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 53 1.3). Compared to the other variants, the primary model also provides more accurate description of the median, as evaluated by MAD (primary: 0.2; relative: 0.6; time limit: 1.0; full decay: 1.1; no decay: 0.3). Overall, the models with relative accumulation or no decay provide slightly worse descriptions than the primary decision model; whereas the models with time limits or full decay provide substantially worse descriptions (these models are likely to underpredict the total number of thoughts when decision makers sample both positive and negative supports and thus do not accumulate strong enough preferences to make a decision).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thought Clusters</head><p>Using simulated decisions from the combined memory-decision model, we can predict the distribution of thought clusters for each experiment. For this we used the parameter values estimated from the primary decision model, and compared the performance of four memory models, including the primary memory model, a constrained model with semantic congruence turned off, one with decision congruence turned off, and the final one with both turned off.</p><p>Cluster distributions based on 12,000 simulated decisions are presented in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Here we observe that the simulated cluster distributions of the primary memory model closely match observations; the MAD of the proportions of clusters is only 0.002 over our ten experiments.</p><p>However, models without decision congruence, semantic congruence, or any congruence effects also do very well at predicting thought cluster distribution (MAD of 0.004, 0.003, 0.005 respectively). This is likely due to the fact that these models all permit flexible baseline cluster sampling probabilities, = [ 1 , 2 , … , 7 ], which can adjust to capture cluster sampling frequencies even when decision and semantic congruence are turned off. We obtain similar results with the k = 2 and k = 4 cluster solutions, as shown in the supplemental materials.</p></div>

Such a model predicts the probability of sampling a semantic or decision congruent cluster to be higher than that generated by an IID sampling model, a pattern reflected in human data. We simulated 12,000 rounds of the decision process using parameter posterior distributions from the primary decision model and the four memory models mentioned above. Our primary memory model, with both semantic and decision congruence on, achieves a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.004 for predicting the mean semantic distance between contiguous thoughts (upper panel), and a MAD of 0.010 for predicting the probability of sampling a decision-congruent thought (lower panel). In contrast, a model without semantic congruence has a MAD of 0.073 for predicting the semantic congruence pattern and a MAD of 0.010 for predicting the decision congruence pattern. Likewise, a model without decision congruence has a MAD of 0.006 for predicting the semantic congruence pattern but a MAD of 0.116 for predicting the decision congruence pattern. Finally, a model without any congruence effects fails to predict both patterns, with a MAD of 0.095 for semantic congruence and a MAD of 0.177 for decision congruence. We obtain similar results with the k = 2 and k = 4 cluster solutions, as shown in the supplemental materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision Patterns</head><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figures 7 and 8</ref> we show that the assumptions in our primary decision model are also necessary for describing the qualitative patterns in our decision data. Specifically, <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the predicted response probabilities (keep deliberating, top panel, or choosing the first option, bottom panel) as a function of the cumulative support for the first option. Here the predicted response probabilities were computed using the posterior distributions of the decision parameters, as well as observed support ratings generated by participants. We can see that the predicted probabilities from the primary decision model reflect the qualitative patterns in our data, with the probability of continuing deliberation decreasing as the magnitude of cumulative support increases, and the probability of selecting a response increasing as its support increases.</p><p>Here the primary decision model achieves a mean absolute deviation <ref type="formula">(</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predicting Manipulation Effects</head><p>If the parameters of our best-fit model capture underlying memory and decision processes, then these parameters should be able to predict the effects of experimental manipulations that alter participant thoughts at the start of the experiment. Inspired by previous experimental research using such a methodology (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Johnson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Weber et al., 2007)</ref>, we attempted such manipulations in Experiments 2a and 2b. These experiments used the decision prompts from Experiment 1c ("Can money buy happiness?") and Experiment 1d ("Is nuclear power safe?"), but asked half the participants to begin deliberation by listing a thought that supports the first option ("yes") and asked the other half of the participants to begin deliberation by listing a thought that supports the second option ("no"). By using the same decision prompts from Experiments 1c and 1d, we were able to evaluate the generalizability of our model, by testing whether it can make accurate out-of-sample predictions for new datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 57</head><p>As expected, our manipulations did bias choices in favor of the prime, with participants asked to list a "yes"-supporting thought being more likely to respond with "yes", and participants asked to list a "no"-supporting thought being more likely to respond with "no". In Experiment 2a, the choice probability of "yes" is 60.7% in condition 1, and 40.8% in condition 2 ( 2 (1) = 7.65, = 0.006). Similar priming effects can also be observed in Experiment 2b (choice probability for "yes" in condition 1: 72.3%; condition 2: 39.4%; 2 (1) = 22.43, &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Can our memory and decision models make out-of-sample predictions regarding the choice probability change between the two priming conditions? To test this, we used the posterior samples of parameters from Experiments 1c and 1d and predicted choice probabilities for trials in which the first thought cluster supported "yes" (condition 1) and "no" (condition 2).</p><p>The point estimations for choice probability differences were based on 12,000 posterior predictive samples from Experiments 1c and 1d.</p><p>As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref>, the primary memory model, the model with semantic congruence turned off, and the model with decision congruence turned off, predict choice probability differences between the two conditions in a manner that is very similar to the observed differences. In Experiment 2a, where the observed choice probability difference is 19.9%, the three models predict choice probability differences of 24.5%, 26.5% and 22.1% respectively.</p><p>Similarly, in Experiment 2b, where the observed choice probability difference is 32.9%, the predicted choice probability differences are 35.7%, 38.9%, and 24.6% respectively. The model with both decision and semantic congruence turned off underpredicts the differences between conditions, with predictions of 13.7% in Experiment 2a, and predictions of 23.4% in Experiment 2b. Consistent with query theory, our modeling results illustrate two mechanisms responsible for DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 58 the effect of thought priming on decision: 1) the manipulated first thought; 2) congruence effects, which reinforce the manipulation by further activating thoughts congruent with the prime.</p><p>In <ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref> we further illustrate the congruence effects on thought sampling in Experiments 2a and 2b. Here, after excluding the first thoughts (which were exogenously manipulated), we still observe higher sampling proportions for thought clusters supporting the first response option for participants in condition 1, and higher sampling proportions for thought clusters supporting the second response option for participants in condition 2. We then used the parameters estimated from Experiments 1c and 1d to predict this effect. Crucially, our primary models closely capture these thought sampling biases. Overall, there is a mean absolute deviation of 0.027 between the predictions of the primary model and observed thought cluster proportions.</p><p>The predictions of the other memory model variants have larger MADs (decision congruence only: 0.029; semantic congruence only 0.039; no congruence effects: 0.071). Overall, these results show that our memory and decision models predict both the change in choice probabilities and the change in thought sampling probabilities, between the two priming conditions. These conclusions are unchanged if we use the k = 2 and k = 4 cluster solutions, instead of the k = 3 solutions, as shown in the supplemental materials.</p><p>The results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 13</ref> and <ref type="figure">Figure 14</ref> were based on out-of-sample predictions (parameters estimated using Experiments 1c and 1d and predictions made for Experiments 2a and 2b).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A Tractable Framework</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 59</head><p>We have presented a framework for modeling naturalistic memory-based decision making, in the empirical paradigm introduced by query theory. Our approach uses computational language models to preprocess and quantify the content of thoughts retrieved from memory.</p><p>These thoughts are combined into discrete clusters, and a context-dependent memory process specifies the retrieval of thoughts from these clusters. Context-dependent decision processes are similarly used to model how retrieved thoughts guide final responses.</p><p>Overall, our framework is highly general as it subsumes numerous existing memory and decision models within a single computational system. It is also highly tractable, as the parameters of these models can be retrieved from participant data. We illustrate the generality and tractability of our model by fitting 576 memory and decision models to participant thought retrieval and decision data from multiple experiments in domains such as risk perception, consumer behavior, financial decision making, ethical decision making, legal decision making, food choice, and well-being, society, and culture.</p><p>The models fit to data in our switchboard analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Turner et al., 2018)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dynamics of Memory and Decision Making</head><p>Our fits reveal that memory processes typically display semantic and decision congruence, and decision processes typically display the accumulation of absolute evidence to a threshold. Memory displays moderate context decay (rather than full or no decay), and we find mixed evidence for the role of context decay in decision making (our fits to group-level data show moderate decay, whereas our fits to individual-level data show weak or no decay). Overall, retrieved thoughts increase the retrieval probability of other semantically related thoughts and thoughts that support the same response option, with recently retrieved thoughts playing a larger role in thought retrieval. Additionally, as thoughts are retrieved, their supports are aggregated in separate decision variables (one for each response option), which evolve dynamically until one of the variables reaches a threshold value.</p><p>Models equipped with the above mechanisms are able to quantitatively predict the likelihood of listing different thought clusters, observed thought cluster transitions, total length of deliberation (i.e., number of retrieved thoughts), and response probabilities. Such models are also necessary to account for core qualitative patterns in these memory and decision variables, such as the relationship between choice probability and the set of sampled thoughts, as well as the effect of sampled thoughts on subsequent thoughts. Finally, models with the above mechanisms are able to quantitatively predict the effect of experimental manipulations on thought listing and choice behavior. Thus, in line with human data, these models predict that priming a thought that supports one response option increases the likelihood of sampling other DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 61 thoughts supporting that option (due to decision congruence), and in turn, increases the choice probability of that option. Some of the above patterns have been documented in memory research and decision research, but we are the first to quantitatively model the emergence of these patterns in memory-based decisions, and use these patterns to evaluate a large number of distinct models proposed in prior work.</p><p>Note that these successes depend on the joint modeling of both memory and decision making. In particular, by specifying a full memory-based decision model, we are able to use the model to simulate human-like decisions without relying on experimental data like thought support ratings. At each time point, we can use the memory model to generate a thought, and use (discrete/binary) ratings of the thought cluster to update the decision accumulators, allowing us to predict, out of sample, the behavior of participants on the group level (as we do in Experiments 2a and b).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conditional Independence and Thought Vectors as Useful Modeling Tools</head><p>Our approach can accommodate nuanced memory search and decision dynamics, as memory and decision processes are assumed to interact only via context. Thus, these processes are conditionally independent on context, and can be fit separately to thought listing or decision making data. Of course, this assumption can also be applied to other types of process data, such as eye-tracking or mouse-tracking data (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Schulte-Mecklenbeck et al., 2011)</ref>. As with the memory search task modeled here, these kinds of data involve the sequential sampling of discrete pieces of information, which guide the formation of beliefs and preferences. If we assume that the processes governing attentional dynamics in eye-tracking and mouse-tracking tasks interact with decision making through context (and only through context), we can DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 62 formulate and test joint models of attention and decision making for which attention and decision processes are conditionally independent on context. These models could involve complex search dynamics as well as complex decision rules, but would be tractable given the conditional independence property. 11</p><p>Another crucial component of our modeling framework is our ability to quantify thought content using sentence vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Cer et al., 2018)</ref>, and more generally, to model the types of knowledge representations that influence decisions. It is clear that a complete model of decision making needs access to what people know about judgment and decision targets, and thus needs to be equipped with realistic knowledge representations about the world. In recent work, we have argued that such representations can be approximated using vector semantic models trained on large scale natural language data . In this paper we further illustrate the value of semantic vectors by showing how they can be used to model the content of thoughts during naturalistic decision making. We are especially excited about novel technical advances in this area that facilitate the development of more sophisticated models of judgment and decision making, that are equipped with both human-like knowledge representations as well as humanlike cognitive processes for aggregating knowledge representations to form beliefs and preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further Work on Complex Mental Processes</head><p>For the sake of tractability, we have made simplifying assumptions about the representation or content of thoughts, as well as the memory search processes that operate over them. For example, inspired by the context and maintenance retrieval model <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Polyn et al., 2009)</ref> in list recall research, we have assumed that limits in working memory capacity derive from decay in context. Of course, this is not the only way to implement limits in working memory.</p><p>Search of associative memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Raaijmakers &amp; Shiffrin, 1981)</ref>, for example, assumes that working memory is limited due to probabilistic deletion of older items. Interference-based mechanisms are also possible and may actually best explain capacity limits in certain settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Oberauer et al., 2016)</ref>. We expect that our framework can be modified to accommodate such alternative implementations of working memory capacity limits 12 . It may ultimately be that such alternative mechanisms better account for capacity limits in the present kinds of memory-based decision-making.</p><p>Moreover, we have assumed that every thought belonged to one of a handful of discrete clusterseven though this discards some of the power of distributed vector representationsand that thoughts influenced search of other thoughts only through cluster resampling, decision congruence, and semantic congruence. Although thoughts for a given question may tend to revolve around a limited number of themes or topics represented by our clusters, in reality, thoughtsand the sentences we use to communicate themdo not belong to a finite number of clusters. Rather, there is an infinite number of thoughts and sentences we can express, and moreover, there is a discrete, compositional structure to these thoughts and sentences <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Fodor, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Fodor &amp; Pylyshyn, 1988)</ref>, and it is this structure which licenses more complex forms of (logical) reasoning than those modeled here. Finally, thought vectors are likely to vary from subject to subject, something that we cannot address in the paper (even with our fits to individual-level data). This is, of course, a limitation of all distributional semantics models, which are unable to capture heterogeneity in participant representations. Accommodating participant heterogeneity and more complex forms of thinking and reasoning using quantitative representations is an important topic for future work.</p><p>It is also possible that the act of listing thoughts (as in our experiments) alters deliberation processes, so that our models do not capture memory-based decision making without the thought listing protocol. Fortunately, previous work on the query theory paradigm has found that eliciting thoughts does not alter choice frequencies (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Johnson et al., 2007)</ref>, though future work could attempt to rigorously test this using the modeling framework introduced in this paper. It is also possible that decisions rely on information not revealed during thought listing. For example, people may have certain strong (negative) affective associations with nuclear power that they are not entirely aware of and thus do not explicitly list in their thoughts. This is certainly possible and perhaps even likely, and it should be possible for at least some of these sorts of biases to show up in future decision models as a starting point effect, which we did not account for here. Of course, it is possible that participants do explicitly retrieve and evaluate certain decision-relevant thoughts during deliberation, but choose to omit these in their listed thoughts for various reasons, including social desirability. However, we suspect that few, if any, of our questions are so controversial that subjects feel pressure to censor themselves.</p><p>The decision prompt or type of decision being made may also alter certain properties of memory search and decision-making. In particular, our second and fifth questionswhich entail choices between gift certificate purchases and dinner options, respectivelydiffer from the remaining questions on the memory side. These two questions have a more positive cluster resampling parameter than other questions, and have positive semantic congruence parameters where other questions have negative semantic congruence parameters (see <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>).</p><p>Interestingly, when we fit the hierarchical models to the data collected in Experiment 3, we replicated these results (see <ref type="figure">Figure 10S</ref> in the supplemental materials), indicating that these patterns are not spurious, but rather systematic. We suspect that these two questions are different because of the nature of their decision domain, as they are the only two questions on preferential decision-making. We are unsure why preferential decision making would involve these differences, and therefore suggest that this is a topic for future work (which could, for example, systematically compare model parameters across many variants of the questions used in the current paper). More generally, Experiment 3 in the supplemental materials largely replicated the results of Experiment 1, with the exception of decision decay: our group-level fits support moderate decision decay, but decision decay is close to zero in our hierarchical fits. We speculate on the source of this discrepancy in the supplemental materials, but better understanding this difference in the group-level and hierarchical fits could be a direction for future work.</p><p>There are also certain processes of memory search in word recall and semantic fluency tasks that we have not extended to the present setting, which may still be applicable. Perhaps chief among these are optimal foraging processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hills et al., 2012)</ref> which have been shown to DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 66 operate in semantic memory search. A similar process may operate when searching for thoughts relevant to the present kinds of naturalistic decisions, and future work should attempt to model optimal foraging in the context of memory-based decision making. This work could draw upon the insights of existing theories of semantic memory search, such as those put forward by <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Hills et al. (2012)</ref> (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Abbott et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>There may also be additional processes operating on the decision side. For example, decision makers may decrease their decision threshold as they sample more thoughts (often captured by collapsing boundaries in the sequential sampling model literature, e.g., <ref type="bibr">Hawkins, et al., 2015)</ref>. They may adopt a hybrid decision rule that combines threshold-based and time-limit elements (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Reutskaja et al., 2011)</ref>, or make choice with non-normally distributed noise (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Voss et al., 2019)</ref>. Additionally, a fuller understanding of the priming manipulation in Experiment 2 may require including a flexible starting point parameter in the decision model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Mulder et al., 2012)</ref> 13 . Given the complexity of these decision mechanisms, and possible heterogeneity across individuals, we leave it to future studies to design experiments and expand our modeling framework to better capture the nuances in the decision process. We suspect asking subjects to complete multiple primed questions may lead to an unnatural decision setting, and that multiple primes may not have persistent effects.</p><p>We have also assumed that memory and decision processes do not directly interact. Thus, even though retrieved thoughts influence decisions, they do so only via the support ratings (which we are able to observe through our experimental paradigm). Conversely, the state of the decision context variables (e.g., accumulated evidence favoring the two response options) does not influence thought retrieval. By separating memory and decision processes in this manner we have gained considerable tractability, yet evidence in reasoning and decision-making research suggests that accumulated preferences can have a direct influence on thought activation and retrieval. Specifically, decision makers have been shown to reason through coherencemaximizing processes that result in thought activation that is consistent with the evolving decision variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bhatia, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Glöckner &amp; Betsch, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Holyoak &amp; Simon, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Simon et al., 2004)</ref>. Such mechanisms could also be a product of goal-directed deliberation processes.</p><p>Despite these computational concerns, such a specification is worth testing in future work, as coherence-based reasoning and goal-based decision making is a crucial component of naturalistic decision processes.</p><p>Perhaps many of the extensions of our approach, from accounting for additional outcome and process measures like response times or eye-and mouse-tracking data, to adding additional memory and decision processes like logical reasoning, could be implemented by joining our models with mechanisms implemented in ACT-R's modules <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Anderson et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Marewski &amp; Mehlhorn, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Dimov et al., 2019)</ref>. One advantage of this approach would be that additional free parameters might not be necessary, and instead one could use ACT-R's default parameters that have been validated across many paradigms and tasks of varying complexity. Given the architectural similarities between our frameworksfor example, context in our framework is akin to the module buffers in ACT-Rwe believe such a union of approaches would be both natural and fruitful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 68</head><p>Ultimately, memory-based decision making is likely to contain a mix of complex thinking, reasoning, and decision processes. Some will likely be those we have modeled, like similarity-and decision-congruence in memory and absolute accumulation to threshold in decision making, and some we have not, like logical reasoning, optimal search, and coherencebased reasoning in memory, and starting point biases in decision making. Although our framework is by no means complete, we believe it offers a valuable statistical tool for describing the underlying dynamics of many of these more complex thought processes. By vectorizing thoughts to quantify their content, and by placing these thoughts into a context representation that guides decisions, we allow for a model capable of displaying complex transitions between thoughts, as well as predicting choice probabilities and lengths of deliberation. Attempting to integrate more complex forms of memory and decision making into such a model will likely drive our research for many years to come. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. An illustration of the query theory experimental paradigm, in which participants are asked to list the thoughts that come to their mind as they think about the decision (first screen/left panel). When they have made up their minds, they are asked to stop listing thoughts and make a response (second screen/middle panel). After the decision, they are asked to rate each of their listed thoughts in terms of support for the two response options (third screen/right panel). Note that the wording and rating scale illustrated below are simplifications of those used in our experiments (see text for details). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. Word clouds of the words that are more frequent in each cluster relative to all other clusters for our first experiment ("Is nuclear power safe?"), for the k = 3 clustering solution. Here we display only clusters for no-supporting thoughts (left panels) or yes-supporting thoughts (right panels). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>. An illustration of a hypothetical decision in which the individual is asked "is nuclear power safe"? There are five thought clusters that can be sampled sequentially from memory in this example. Each sample updates decision context (which stores previous memory samples and decision variables) and drives decision making and memory sampling in the next time period. Here the decision takes four time periods and ends with the selection of the "no" response. KS = Keep Sampling; TC = Thought Cluster. Response: "No." <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Distributions of the total number of thoughts sampled by participants in the ten experiments. The solid vertical lines represent medians. Across ten experiments, the primary model, assuming absolute accumulation of discrete supports towards a threshold with partial context decay, provides the closest predictions regarding the median and mode of the observed thought lengths. We also display the predictions of a model with relative accumulation, a model with a time limit mechanism instead of threshold accumulation, a model with full decay, and a model with no decay. <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Distributions of thought clusters from the k = 3 clustering solution in the ten experiments. Here O1-C1, O1-C2, O1-C3 represent clusters for thoughts supporting the first option. Neutral-C1 represents the cluster for all neutral thoughts. O2-C1, O2-C2, O2-C3 represent clusters for thoughts supporting the second option. The primary model, with semantic and decision congruence and partial context decay but no cluster resampling, provides almost perfect predictions of the observed cluster proportions. However, so do models that turn decision and semantic congruence off. Note that all models have flexible baseline cluster activation parameters, allowing them to accommodate aggregate thought cluster distributions. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Permutation analyses for semantic congruence and decision congruence effects. The asterisks represent observed mean Euclidean distance between the cluster centroids of contiguously sampled thought clusters (the left panel), and observed probabilities of sampling a thought supporting the same option as the previously sampled thought (the right panel). Solid dots and error bars are means and 95% confidence interval based on 10,000 permutations in which we randomly reordered thought clusters generated by each participant so that individual heterogeneity in cluster base rates was preserved but sequential effects were broken. These figures display significant semantic and decision congruence effects in most experiments. <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. Probability of continuing sampling (i.e., one minus the probability of ending deliberation; upper panel), and probability of selecting the first response (lower panel), as a function of the cumulative support for the first relative to the second option, in the ten experiments. The probability of continuing sampling thoughts decreases in absolute values of relative support, whereas the probability of choosing the first option increases in cumulative support. These patterns are consistent with the predictions of threshold models with partial or no context decay, such as the primary model that assumes absolute accumulation of discrete supports towards a threshold with partial context decay, and a similar variant that assumes relative accumulation towards a threshold. On the contrary, the pattern cannot be captured by the model variant that assumes full decay or a model that assumes an external time limit mechanism instead of threshold accumulation. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 8</ref>. Probability of continue sampling (upper panel), and probability of selecting the first response (lower panel), as a function of the number of thoughts generated, for the ten experiments. The probability of continuing sampling decreases, and the probability of selecting an option increases, as the number of generated thoughts increases. Our primary model, which assumes absolute accumulation of discrete supports towards a threshold with partial decay, predicts the observed pattern better than a similar model with relative accumulation. Model variants assuming a time limit instead of threshold accumulation, or assuming full context decay, do not capture behavioral patterns. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 9</ref>. WAIC changes as we alter the primary model mechanisms in the ten experiments. The primary memory model assumes semantic and decision congruence and partial context decay but no cluster resampling. Turning cluster resampling on does not change WAICs much; turning the other three mechanisms off increases WAICs substantially. The primary decision model assumes absolute accumulation of discrete supports towards thresholds, with partial context decay. Switching to continuous supports does not influence WAICs much; switching the other three mechanisms leads to large WAIC increases. <ref type="figure">Figure 10</ref>.

This vector guides thought cluster sampling at time t by sending feedback into the thought layer, which determines thought cluster activation based on decision and semantic congruence between pairs of thoughts. Our use of this specification for context implies that the effect of a sampled thought on subsequent memory is assumed to increase additively with multiple samples of the same thought cluster and weaken with time at an exponential rate.Decision congruence captures whether or not a given pair of thought clusters support the same response option. For a pair of thought clusters, j and k, we write decision congruence as D(j,k), with D(j,k) = 1 indicating that the two clusters support the same response, or if they are both neutral; otherwise D(j,k) = 0. The set of pairwise decision congruence measures between the DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 26 K thought clusters are represented in the KxK matrix D. Semantic congruence is the degree to which two thoughts clusters have similar semantic content. For a pair of thought clusters, j and k, we write semantic distance as S(j,k) = ||cj -ck||, where cj and ck are the vector centroids of clusters j and k. S(j,k) is the Euclidean distance of the centers of clusters j and k and thus smaller values of S(j,k) indicate higher semantic congruence between j and k. The set of pairwise semantic congruence measures are represented in the KxK matrix S. D and S are deterministically specified by our data and by the clustering solution on our semantic space. We assume that the context vector mt influences thought cluster activation in the memory layer based on a linear combination of D and S. We write the K-length vector of thought cluster activation in memory as:</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_3"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>we display changes in WAICs in the ten experiments as each of the mechanisms in the primary memory and decision models are altered. The top left panel shows that turning cluster resampling on has a negligible effect on WAIC. The remaining panels on the top row show that turning semantic congruence, decision congruence or partial decay off leads to notable increases in WAICs. The bottom left panel shows how WAICs change when we assume discrete support rather than continuous support in the primary model. Depending on different experiments, discrete or continuous support results in better model fits, but overall, the impact of this mechanism is very small. The remaining panels on the bottom row illustrate the effects of switching the accumulation rule (from absolute to relative), the decision rule (from thresholdbased to time limit), and the context decay (from partial or no decay to full decay): These changes all lead to much worse model fits.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head>Figure 9</head><label>9</label><figDesc>also shows that altering the different mechanisms has a different effect on fits across our ten experiments. Thus, for example, turning off decision congruence increases the WAIC by almost 200 in Experiment 1a but increases WAIC by only 16 in Experiment 1c. In DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 49 contrast, replacing absolute accumulation with relative accumulation increases the WAIC by 102 in Experiment 1f, but only 39 in Experiment 1h. Thus, even though all decision settings display semantic and decision congruence in memory, the absolute accumulation of evidence to a threshold in decision making, and partial context decay in both memory and decision making, not all settings require these mechanisms to the same extent.The above results persist with the k = 2 and k = 4 cluster solutions, as shown in the supplemental materials. All the results are replicated using hierarchical model analyses of Experiment 3 data (which are reported in the supplemental materials), except that the best-fit hierarchical decision model exhibits no context decay in decision-making (rather than partial context decay).ParametersFinally,Figure 10displays the best fitting parameter values in our models. The first row shows posterior means and 95% credible intervals of parameters from the best-fit, full memory model. Most of the ten experiments have small negative values of , large negative values of , large positive values of and moderate values of , except for Experiment 1b and 1e, which have positive and positive . These parameters again show that most experiments display small (non-significant amounts of) recall inhibition and repetition suppression, and large (significant) amounts of decision and semantic congruence, as well as partial context decay. The second row shows parameters from the primary decision model. Here we see that the decision decay parameters ( ) are closer to 0 and are smaller than the memory decay parameters ( ).DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 50This suggests that memory and decision making have different degrees of decay in context.10    </figDesc></figure>

Performance for the models that replace absolute accumulation with relative accumulation is almost the same as our primary model (MAD continuation: 0.080; MAD first option choice: 0.050). The models that force context decay to be completely off are comparatively worse (MAD continuation: 0.091; MAD first option choice: 0.057). The models that replace threshold decision making with a time limit, or force context decay to be completely on, are especially bad (MAD continuation: 0.130 and 0.128; MAD first option choice: 0.079 and 0.096), as they are unable to capture the effect of cumulative support on the probability of sampling.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head>Figure 8</head><label>8</label><figDesc>shows the predicted probabilities of choice as a function of the number of thoughts generated. Here our primary model simulations capture the observed data pattern, in which the probabilities of continuing deliberation decrease and the probabilities of selecting an DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 56 option increase, as the number of generated thoughts increase. Across all the models, our primary model achieved the smallest MAD for predicting probabilities of continuing deliberation (0.081) and probabilities of selecting the first option (0.054). The models that switch context decay completely off perform almost equally well (MAD continuation: 0.086; MAD first option chosen: 0.054). Choice simulations of the models with relative accumulation are less sensitive to the number of thoughts (as reflected by flatter slopes inFigure 8) and result in larger MADs (MAD continuation: 0.147; MAD first option chosen: 0.079). Again, the models that replace threshold decision making with a time limit, or force context decay to be completely on, are especially bad (MAD continuation: 0.184 and 0.185; MAD first option chosen: 0.092 and 0.093).</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>the above sections we have introduced a number of different mechanisms for modeling memory and decision processes. For example, memory context can influence thought cluster DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 32 sampling based on semantic congruence or decision congruence, or both. Likewise, decision making can involve a single representation for the relative support of the two options or separate representations for the absolute support for each option, as well as decisions based on a threshold or a time limit mechanism. Both memory and decision context can be susceptible to decay.These and other mechanisms are largely separate from each other and can be individually added to or removed from the models. These mechanisms are summarized inTable 2.The type of analysis we perform here is known as a switchboard analysis and was recently used by<ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Turner et al. (2018)</ref> to analyze the set of decision mechanisms responsible for multiattribute context effects. A switchboard analysis allows researchers to investigate not only existing models but also hybrid models that can be generated by combining various model mechanisms, and thus provides a more nuanced understanding of the psychological properties at play in the task at hand. In our case, the switchboard analysis also allows us to pair different types of memory models with different types of decision models, and subsequently characterize DECISIONS FROM MEMORY 33 the very large set of distinct cognitive models that could be responsible for memory-based decision making.</figDesc><table /><note>Our goal in this paper is to analyze memory and decision models with each different combination of underlying mechanisms. As there are a total of 2x2x2x3 = 24 different memory models generated through the combination of the four memory mechanisms, and a total of 2x2x2x3 = 24 different decision models generated through the combination of the four decision mechanisms, our paper implicitly involves the analysis of 24x24 = 576 memory-based decision models. Each model features unique set of mechanisms, and generates a unique set of predictions for our recall and decision data. By fitting these 576 models to our data we can accurately characterize the set of memory and decision mechanisms necessary to describe memory-based decision making.</note></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Of course, we can also combine various memory and decision mechanisms to generate combinations of existing memory and decision models for describing memory-based decision making. For example, allowing for semantic congruence, threshold decision making, absolute accumulation, as well as partial memory and decision context decay, gives us a CMR-style memory model whose output is integrated by a leaky accumulator. In contrast, allowing for decision congruence with a threshold decision rule, no context decay, and the relative</figDesc><table><row><cell>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY</cell><cell>36</cell></row><row><cell>).</cell><cell></cell></row></table><note>accumulation of discrete supports, gives us a query theory memory model whose output is integrated by a decision-by-sampling style model. Similarly, allowing for only semantic congruence in memory, relative accumulation of discrete supports to a threshold in decision making, and full context decay in both memory and decision making, gives us a Markov random walk through a semantic network whose output is integrated by lexicographic semi-order heuristic. Overall, our framework instantiates these and 573 other combinations of memory and decision models, and is capable of testing which of these combinations best describes memory- based decision making through switchboard analysis.</note></figure>

To rigorously understand these patterns in our data, and to disentangle the above mechanisms from other related mechanisms that could be responsible for the observed patterns, we fit 576 distinct memory-based decision making models (24 memory models × 24 decision models) to the data from each of the ten experiments using Bayesian model fitting. Because of the conditional independence hypothesis, we were able to separately fit the 24 memory models to thought-listing data and the 24 decision models to decision data. As outlined above, these models are obtained by combining different memory and decision mechanisms, and a switchboard analysis comparing each of these models against each other can shed light on the combination of memory and decision mechanisms necessary to describe the data. Note that as in the qualitative analysis above, we pool the data from each of the two conditions in Experiments 2a and b. However, as these experiments asked participants to begin the thought listing task by retrieving a thought that supports either the first or the second response option, our baseline activation strengths of the seven clusters for the first thoughts in</figDesc><table><row><cell>DECISIONS FROM MEMORY</cell><cell>46</cell></row><row><cell>these experiments were set to γ =[γ1,γ2,γ3,0,0,0,0] or γ=[0,0,0,0,γ5,γ6,γ7] depending on the</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>condition (in the next section we analyze the effects of the experimental manipulation in these</cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell>two experiments in detail).

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="2">Of course, while the resulting data in free recall and query theory are structurally similar, the different tasks may lead to different retrieval dynamics and search strategies, due to different underlying goals.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">In general, our specific specification of working memory capacity limits, in terms of context decay, stems from our application of the CMR memory model to memory-based decision making. Decay is also part of leaky integration models, which we consider on the decision side of our analysis. Thus both the memory and decision components of our model share the same capacity limits, which we believe offers some amount of theoretical cohesion. Of course alternate capacity limits, such as limitations to the number of items in working memory as in the ACT-R or SAM frameworks, could be feasible. We revisit this possibility in the discussion section of this paper.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="5">We can also generate, as a special case, a memory model that samples only based on decision congruence and does not consider the semantic content of thoughts, by setting ωS = 0. Intuitively, this would resemble a model with only three thought clusters: one for positively supporting thoughts, one for negatively supporting thoughts, and one for neutral thoughts.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="6">Note that although we obtained two responses per participant in Experiment 1, this is too little data to appropriately model individual heterogeneity. Thus, our analysis of Experiment 1 involves only group-level fits. To examine the issue of individual-level variance we conducted Experiment 3 (which is reported in supplemental materials).</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">Note that in this paper, we use k to represent the number of clusters that support the choice of an option (obtained using k-means clustering). On the other hand, K is the total number of clusters. Because there are k clusters supporting the first choice, k supporting the second choice, and one supporting neither, K = 2k + 1.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="8">The decision prompt for Experiment 1e is "Would you prefer to eat a salad or a burger for dinner?". In our experiments, participants display weaker semantic congruence in questions regarding consumer preferences, compared to other decision domains. For detailed discussions, please refer to the section on Parameters in the Hierarchical Modeling and Participant Heterogeneity section of the supplemental materials.9  Overall, the magnitude of context decay parameters in the decision models are much smaller (closer to 0), compared to those in the memory models in all experiments. We elaborate on this point in the Parameters section below in the main text.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="11">Intuitively, such models would retain the decision components of our approach, but would replace the memory components with assumptions better suited to modeling attentional dynamics. In such implementations, context would keep track of the regions of the display (rather than individual thoughts) that have been previously sampled. Likewise, eye-movement transitions could be sensitive to physical proximity rather than semantic congruence, and baseline activation biases could be due to item positioning on the display.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="12">Although certain implementations of capacity limits, such as probabilistic forgetting, may make the likelihood function no longer analytically tractable, meaning that the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm used to fit our models no longer apply, and other Bayesian computation methods may be necessary (e.g.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Turner et al., 2016)</ref>.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="13">Currently such a starting point effect is hard to empirically distinguish from the decision congruence effect of our memory model, and cannot be parametrically recovered without many repetitions of the same question for an individual.</note>

We generated four chains of 3,500 samples, where the first 500 samples of each chain were burn-ins. The results were based on the combined 12,000 samples for each model.</p><p>Overall, we used weakly informative prior distributions for the parameters. The prior distributions for the baseline activation strengths of the clusters (γ) and the scalar weights in the memory models (ωR, ωS, and ωD) were Normal(0,2 2 ) and Normal(0,5 2 ), respectively. To avoid non-identifiability, we constrained the activation strength of the last cluster to be 0 in all the memory models.</p><p>On the decision side, the prior distribution used for the threshold value (τ) was Half-Normal(0,35 2 ). Instead of fitting the standard deviation parameter (σ) of the normally distributed error at time t (εt) directly, we fit σ/τ in the model. The prior for this parameter is Half-Normal(0,0.5 2 ). In the time limit models, the probability of continuing deliberation (λ) is the same after each thought cluster sample, and thus the deliberation time T follows a Geometric distribution. The prior distribution used for λ was Uniform(0,1). The prior distribution used for the standard deviation parameter (σ) of the normally distributed error at time t (εt) is Half-Normal(0,35 2 ). In both the memory and the decision models, the prior distribution for the decay parameters (δM, δD) was Uniform(0,1).</p><p>To assess model convergence, ^ of parameters were calculated for each model.
