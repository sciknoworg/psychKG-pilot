<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Psychotic experiences such as delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorganization, appear to be continuously distributed and varying in their degree of symptom persistence and severity in the general population <ref type="bibr">(van Os and Reininghaus, 2016)</ref>. The psychosis continuum may be considered to range from subclinical manifestations in the form of schizotypal personality traits and psychotic-like experiences in the general population through attenuated psychotic symptoms in the prodromal phase of psychosis (also referred to as clinical-high-risk state/CHR-state), to full-blown psychotic disorders at the other end. The latter rank among the most disabling disorders worldwide and impose a high economic burden on society linked to costs of caring and productivity losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Vos et al., 2017)</ref>. This burden further increases in individuals that relapse after their first episode of psychosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Hong et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fasseeh et al., 2018)</ref> It is therefore not surprising that the search for potential predictors and moderators of risk for the development of psychosis and its relapse has been a major focus of research over the last decade. This is particularly important to support the development of individualized risk prediction models which may help personalize interventions based on individual risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Sanfelici et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Koutsouleris et al., 2021)</ref> An environmental risk factor, that has often been associated with psychotic disorders, is cannabis use.</p><p>Cannabis is, after alcohol and tobacco, currently the most popular psychoactive substance worldwide (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2022). Particularly, with the growing trend of legalization of cannabis as well as increasing interest in its medicinal use worldwide, one of the pressing concerns is its association with psychotic symptoms and disorders.</p><p>Studies using randomized controlled designs have shown, that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis can induce transient psychotic-like experiences in healthy individuals and worsen existing symptoms in the clinical population <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(D'Souza et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Cross-sectional studies have shown that cannabis use is more frequent in individuals at clinical high-risk of psychosis (CHR) and those with established psychosis than in healthy controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Addington et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pardo et al., 2021)</ref>. Furthermore, several case-control and longitudinal cohort studies have reported that cannabis use is associated with increased odds and risk of onset of psychotic disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Andréasson et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Os et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zammit et al., 2002)</ref>. However, the results of these studies are not always consistent and may even vary across different subpopulations, vulnerability levels, and outcomes of the psychosis continuum. Further factors that might moderate the effects are genetic variables and cannabis use-related variables such as frequency of use (occasional vs chronic use), age of onset of cannabis use and potency/type of cannabis used <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(van der Steur et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kiburi et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>In parallel with the growing evidence base of primary studies, there is also an increasing number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have attempted to summarize the evidence regarding the association of cannabis use with particular psychosis-related outcome of interest such as subclinical expressions of psychosis (psychotic-like-experiences and schizotypal personality traits) as well clinically relevant psychotic symptoms and disorders in the general population, attenuated psychotic symptoms in CHR individuals and psychotic symptoms and relapse in individuals with established psychosis. Summary reports focusing on the association between cannabis use and those outcomes, either qualitative, in the form of systematic reviews or quantitative syntheses in the form of metaanalyses, have adopted slightly differing methodological approaches and decisions that have led to differing conclusions on the same topic. Existing evidence syntheses may also convey either more or less information on a potential causal relationship between cannabis use and psychosis.</p><p>Under such circumstances, umbrella reviews and evidence maps provide a useful bird's-eye view and appraisal of the extant evidence. Assessing existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses against a quality metric allows a more nuanced and robust understanding of the current evidence, and also helps highlight any gaps that remain. Here, we employ this approach to bring together all existing evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses to synthesize and present current best evidence on the effects of cannabis use on psychosis-related outcomes and moderating factors across the psychosis continuum.</p><p>We focused on systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies, as our aim was to investigate the association between recreational cannabis use and persistent rather than transient psychosis-related outcomes. Often it is challenging to disentangle transient psychotomimetic effects of cannabis from acute intoxication under the influence of cannabis. To the best of our knowledge, no studies to date have randomized participants to sustained cannabis exposure to investigate non-transient psychosis-related outcomes. Therefore, despite their well-known limitations in terms of causal inferences, we only included systematic reviews and meta-analyses summarizing data from observational studies, which represent the current best available evidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Method</head><p>We created a systematic evidence map using the umbrella review approach of existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The protocol for this study, including the methodology for the review process was preregistered on the open-access database PROSPERO before starting the review process (registration number: CRD42021257756). Not enough statistical information on the data that authors of existing systematic reviews had extracted from the primary studies was forthcoming. Hence, we did not re-analyse the primary study data included in the reviews quantitatively as originally planned, but instead summarized the statistical data narratively and presented the results in the form of forest plots and evidence maps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Search Method</head><p>We systematically searched the Web of Science (including the databases science citation index expanded, emerging sources citation index, social sciences citation index, Arts &amp; humanities citation index, conference proceedings citation index, and Medline) to identify systematic reviews or metaanalyses published from the inception of these databases to the present time. The first systematic search was performed on the 1 st of July 2021, and this was updated on the 27 th of January 2023, searching article titles and abstracts using the following search terms:</p><p>(AB= (schizo* OR psychotic* OR psychosis OR psychoses )) OR (TI= (schizo* OR psychotic* OR ps ychosis OR psychoses )) AND (AB= (((systematic) AND (review) ) OR meta-analysis) ) OR (TI= (((systematic) AND (review) ) OR meta-analysis)) AND (AB= (marij* OR cannab* OR marih* OR Hashish* OR Hemp*) ) OR (TI= (marij* OR cannab* OR marih* OR Hashish* OR Hemp*) ).</p><p>Further, we manually searched reference lists to identify any additional relevant articles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Selection Criteria</head><p>Systematic reviews or meta-analyses examining cannabis use as a risk factor for any psychosis-related outcome (e.g. psychotic-like experiences, schizotypy, attenuated psychosis symptoms, transition to psychosis, psychotic symptoms, development of psychosis, psychosis relapse) in any population (e.g. healthy or general population, clinical high-risk population, patients with established psychotic disorder)</p><p>were eligible for inclusion.</p><p>We assessed articles written in English, German, French, Spanish or Portuguese for inclusion as those were the languages accessible to the authors.</p><p>Conference abstracts, umbrella reviews, and systematic reviews and meta-analyses of non-observational studies (e.g. those that investigated the effects of THC or Cannabidiol randomized-controlled trials or neuroimaging studies) and those written in another language than those stated above were excluded from consideration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Data extraction and quality assessment</head><p>Two authors (ED and RP) independently screened titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles to exclude irrelevant studies. The full texts of the remaining articles were then checked against the selection criteria.</p><p>After both screening phases, any disagreements were discussed and resolved with the first author JMG and the senior author SB.</p><p>The data extraction was completed in duplicate by pairs of researchers working independently (ED, RP, AV, YS and JMG). Afterwards, the data was cross-checked, and any discrepancies were resolved in discussion with one of the researchers (JMG). From the selected systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we extracted title, authors, country of the primary author, year of publication, number of primary studies included in the review, study design of included primary studies, any statistical data estimated as part of the meta-analyses as well as data from and the risk of bias assessments from primary studies reported in the systematic reviews/ meta-analyses. All data was extracted and stored in excel spreadsheets that were pre-formatted and customized for this study.</p><p>To assess the quality of included systematic reviews and meta-analyses we applied the 16-item AMSTAR-2 tool for systematic reviews of healthcare interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Shea et al., 2017)</ref>. This was also done in duplicate with pairs of researchers (ED, RP, JMG, DB and YS) working independently for every included systematic review with discrepancies resolved through discussion or by consulting the senior researcher (SB). We determined the overall rating of the AMSTAR following the suggestions given in the source publication of AMSTAR 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Shea et al., 2017)</ref> by categorizing the reviews as high, moderate, low or critically low quality based on the extent of critical flaws. The following items were considered as critical flaws when the answer to the Item was "no": Item 4 ("Did the review authors use a comprehensive literature search strategy"); Item 9 ("Did the review authors use a satisfactory technique for assessing the risk of bias (RoB) in individual studies that were included in the review; Item 11 ("If meta-analysis was justified did the review authors use appropriate methods for statistical combination of results?"; Item 13 ("Did the review authors account for RoB in individual studies when interpreting/discussing the results of the review?"; and Item 15 ("If they performed quantitative synthesis did the review authors carry out an adequate investigation of publication bias and discuss its likely impact on the results of the review?). Reviews were classified as "high" quality when they had 0 critical flaws (or with up to 1 non-critical flaw); "moderate" when they had no critical flaw but more than one non-critical flaw; or "low" when they had one critical flaw and "critically low" with more than one critical flaw.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Evidence map and summary</head><p>Using the R-package "DiagrammeR" by Iaonne <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Iaonne, 2018)</ref> we created a visualized overview based on the extracted data from the systematic reviews in the form of a network (JMG). We created an overall evidence map of cannabis use and its association with psychosis related outcomes in different populations (healthy population, CHR population and psychosis population) which summarized the authors of the systematic reviews the outcomes investigated (schizotypy, psychotic-like-experiences, attenuated psychosis symptoms/CHR symptoms, CHR state, psychotic symptoms, clinical diagnosis of psychosis, psychotic symptoms in psychosis, psychosis relapse) the primary studies that were included in these reviews, as well as study design, statistical significance and the risk of bias assessments of the latter. We only used the data that was provided in the published papers and supplementary materials of included systematic reviews and did not additionally extract data from the primary studies to summarize data as reported in the reviews and outline any gaps in reporting. Data was either extracted from tables, manuscript text, forest plots or figures in the main paper of included systematic reviews or their supplementary material. To categorize the data in the different population outcome groups, we oriented based on the categorization and study aims set out by the authors of respective systematic reviews. For example, if the study aim was to summarize the association between cannabis use and subclinical psychotic experiences we had included this review in the respective section and evidence map for "psychotic-like experiences", even if the same primary study papers or same assessment tools had been used to summarize the association between cannabis use and the development of psychotic symptoms or full-blown psychosis in the healthy population in other reviews. For the purposes of the present manuscript, we have used the term "psychotic-like-experiences" only when referring to subclinical psychotic experiences measured in the healthy population but not in the psychosis population. If symptoms had been measured in individuals with established psychosis we have consistently referred to them as "psychotic symptoms". If the review included studies that investigated a range of outcomes and did not summarize the different outcomes in separate sections or analyses on those outcomes, we have summarized those with the term "any psychosis outcome". Similarly, if the aim of the review authors was to investigate whether cannabis use was associated with earlier age of onset of psychosis, we have reported the review under "healthy population", although the studies summarized had included studies that assessed the age of onset of psychosis retrospectively in patients with psychosis.</p><p>For the risk of bias/quality assessment, different tools have been used by the authors of published reviews. We re-coded the ratings done by the systematic reviews to facilitate their inclusion and comparability in our visualized overview using the quality categories of "high" (low risk of bias/high quality), "medium" (medium risk of bias/medium quality) and "low" (high risk of bias/low quality). We recoded the ratings that used the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wells, G. A., Shea, B., O'Connell, D., Peterson, J., Welch, V., Losos, M., &amp; Tugwell, P., 2000)</ref>) as "high" with a NOS rating of 7-9, "medium" with a NOS rating of 4-6 and "low" with a NOS rating of 0-3. We adapted the categories from the ratings carried out using the " Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions" (Robins-I <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Sterne et al., 2016)</ref>) tool or those done using the "A Cochrane Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool: for Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions" (ACROBAT-NRSI(Sterne, J.A.C., Higgins, J.P.T., Reeves, B.C, 2014)) tool such that we re-coded the ratings as "high", "medium" or "low" in quality to correspond to the ratings of "low", "moderate" or "serious" risk of bias based on ROBINS-I or ACROBAT-NRSI as reported in the systematic reviews or meta-analyses. We also re-coded the ratings from reviews that used the "strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology" (STROBE) statement checklist (von Elm, E., Altman, D. G., Egger, M., Pocock, S. J., Gøtzsche, P. C., &amp; Vandenbroucke, J. P., 2007) such that ratings of as 0-3 were coded as "low", 4-5 as "medium" and 6-7 as "high" quality.</p><p>To visualize the information given in the systematic reviews in the evidence map we used different forms and colours for the different study types and outcomes of the evidence synthesis and primary evidence (see Figure1 and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 1</ref>-extended in supplementary material). To facilitate its display, we further divided the overall network map into subnetworks based on the population and outcome that has been investigated.</p><p>Here, for ease of visualization, we report the simpler versions of the evidence maps that depict solely the details of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses rather than the primary studies. The extended maps that include all the details stated above are reported in the supplementary material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results</head><p>For an overview of the systematic review process see PRISMA flow diagram in figure 2. Overall, we identified 32 reviews on cannabis use and its association with psychosis-related outcomes (summarizing data from healthy individuals in 12 systematic reviews; from CHR individuals in seven, from psychosis patients in six systematic reviews and from moderators of risk in nine). For an overview of all the populations and outcomes that have been investigated please see figure 3.</p><p>The key evidence from the included systematic reviews and meta-analyses is summarized below using a two-tiered approach, which is further visualized in the network maps and forest plots. At the first level, they are organized in terms of the population investigated in the systematic reviews and then further grouped under outcomes of interest considered.</p><p>Last, information on risk moderators were grouped in terms of the variable investigated. The results of our AMSTAR-2 evaluation of the included systematic reviews and meta-analyses are reported in table 1. A final overview of the key questions investigated in the included systematic reviews and metaanalyses as well as the summary conclusions based on the strength (as assessed based on consistency of conclusions from multiple independent reviews) and quality (as assessed by their AMSTAR-2 rating) of evidence are summarized in table 2.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Cannabis use and its association with psychotic-like-experiences</head><p>As visualized in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, three systematic reviews (including two meta-analyses) <ref type="bibr">(van Os et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Linscott and van Os, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ragazzi et al., 2018)</ref> investigated the association between cannabis use and the risk of psychotic-like-experiences in healthy individuals with effect sizes ranging from OR 1.75 to OR 1.77 for incidence to OR 2.51 to 2.59 for prevalence (see <ref type="figure">figure 5)</ref>. No pooled effect-size estimate has been computed for the frequency of subclinical psychotic-like experiences in the reviews published to date.</p><p>Overall, the current evidence seems to agree that cannabis use is associated with increased prevalence (two meta-analyses rated as critically low quality showing evidence in support), incidence (two meta-analyses rated as critically low quality showing evidence in support) and severity of psychotic-like experiences (one narrative systematic review rated as critically low quality (see table 2). However, as all three systematic reviews received a "critically low" AMSTAR-2 rating, the evidence synthesis may be biased (see table 1). For example, none of them included a proper risk of bias/study quality assessment of included studies. <ref type="bibr">Ragazzi and colleagues (2018)</ref> attempted to do so using the STROBE guidelines, however, did not report their results (as shown in figure 4).</p><p>None of the reviews investigated the potential causal relationship between cannabis use and PLEs.</p><p>Ragazzi and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Ragazzi et al., 2018)</ref> who mostly summarized the evidence of cross-sectional studies, pointed out that reverse causality may have led to the association as the included studies did not rule out the possibility that people with PLEs may have used cannabis as a form of self-medication for their symptoms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Cannabis use and its association with psychometric schizotypy</head><p>We found only one systematic review and meta-analysis that investigated the link between cannabis use and psychometric schizotypy and this was carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Szoke et al. 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Szoke et al., 2014</ref> (AMSTAR-2 rating: critically low), see <ref type="figure">figure 6</ref>. The authors reported a significant association between lifetime cannabis use and higher schizotypy score across all schizotypy dimensions (total score, positive, negative and disorganization dimensions), and with current cannabis use in all dimensions aside from the negative dimension (see <ref type="figure">figure 6</ref>) with the effect sizes ranging from standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.10 for the negative dimension up to SMD 0.44 for the positive dimension (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">figure 7)</ref>.</p><p>Due to the sparsity of longitudinal studies the authors restricted their inclusion criteria to cross-sectional studies. They discussed that lack of longitudinal studies limited the ability to disentangle whether the association between cannabis use and schizotypy was causal in nature. Interpreting the current available evidence from longitudinal studies that suggest a bidirectional association between cannabis use and schizotypy, the authors further speculated that cannabis use may be one of many potential triggers that gradually increase schizotypal symptoms in vulnerable individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Cannabis use and its association with the development of psychosis</head><p>As depicted in figure 8, we found two meta-analyses and two narrative systematic reviews reporting on the association between cannabis use and psychotic symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Semple et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Henquet et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marconi et al., 2016)</ref> with effect sizes ranging from odds ratio (OR) of 1.90 for lifetime cannabis use to OR 3.59 for most frequent cannabis use (see <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>).</p><p>As depicted in figure 9, the same systematic reviews, as well another meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr">Moore and</ref> Colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Moore et al., 2007)</ref> further reported data on the association between cannabis use and the development of clinically relevant psychotic disorder with effect sizes ranging from OR 2.37 for lifetime cannabis use up to OR 5.07 for most frequent cannabis use (see <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>).</p><p>As shown in figure 10, three meta-analyses and two narrative systematic reviews reported a significant positive association between cannabis use (lifetime, frequent and any cannabis use) and any psychotic outcome summarizing data from cross-sectional, longitudinal, and (prospective) cohort studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Moore et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Marconi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Polkosnik et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sorkhou et al., 2021)</ref> with effect-sizes ranging from OR 1.41 for lifetime cannabis use up to OR 3.90 for most frequent cannabis use (see figure 5).</p><p>Overall, the evidence seems to agree that cannabis use is associated with increased psychotic symptoms (four critically low-quality systematic reviews showing evidence in support), and the onset of a psychotic disorder (four critically low-quality and one medium-quality systematic review showing evidence in support) and also shows an association with the broader category of any psychosis outcome (two medium-quality, one low quality and two critically low-quality systematic reviews in support).</p><p>Henquet and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Henquet et al., 2008)</ref> and le <ref type="bibr">Bec and colleagues (Le Bec et al., 2009)</ref> tried to address the question of causality through narratively comparing the study data with established criteria for causality such as temporality (exposure precedes the outcome), reproducibility (studies consistently report an association between exposure and outcome), a dose-response relationship and the existence of a plausible biological mechanism that links exposure and outcome. Both reviews came to the conclusion that those criteria seem to be fulfilled and that cannabis use may be a component cause for psychosis, but that more research was still needed to confirm this assumption. Henquet and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Henquet et al., 2008)</ref>also noted that given the current data a bidirectional relationship between cannabis use and psychosis was more likely than reverse causation. Furthermore, the authors noticed that the association does not seem to be due to confounding only, as although effect sizes in the primary studies decreased after controlling for confounders the statistical associations did not go away.

Whereas three of the reviews did not confirm a positive association, a meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kraan et al. (Kraan, 2017)</ref> reported a significant effect of current cannabis abuse or dependence but not lifetime cannabis use. However, closer inspection of the evidence map ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 14)</ref>, indicates that the latter significant overall effect-size (see <ref type="figure">figure 5</ref>) was only based on one significant study. This study also suggested that the association was confounded by alcohol use, as outlined in the manuscript of Kraan and colleagues. On the basis of this meta-analysis and other studies, the recent narrative review by van der Steur and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(van der Steur et al., 2020</ref>) (AMSTAR-2: "low") concluded that not only frequent cannabis use and dependence, but also lifetime cannabis use increased the risk for transition to psychosis. The authors also suggested that the association was more pronounced in heavy cannabis users and that it might be confounded by alcohol use. Interestingly, the latter review included significant results of studies that have not been included in the other reviews that cited the same studies. The latest meta-analysis by Oliver and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Oliver et al., 2020)</ref> which included more studies (data from clinical cohorts as well as those nested within randomized controlled trials), did not report a significant pooled effect-size. However, in this synthesis the authors did not investigate the effect of frequency of cannabis use. A later systematic review by <ref type="bibr">Polkosnik and</ref> colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Polkosnik et al., 2021)</ref> included only a few studies with mixed results that were already included in the other older reviews and came to the opposing conclusion, that cannabis use may increase the risk of transition to psychosis in CHR.</p><p>Taking those conflicting findings together, it still remains unclear whether there exists an association between cannabis use and transition to psychosis in CHR (one critically low-quality review and two low-quality review in support, three critically low systematic reviews showing evidence against, see table 2). While it has been suggested that the effect varies with the extent of use (in terms of frequency and quantity of use), this warrants further investigation.</p></div>

Zammit and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Zammit et al., 2008</ref>) (AMSTAR-2:"Critically low") found inconsistent results for the association with positive symptoms and no association with negative symptoms. The meta-analysis by Schoeler and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Schoeler et al., 2016)</ref> suggested that continued cannabis users experienced higher positive symptoms compared to non-users (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">figure 7)</ref>, however, this result seems to be driven by only two low quality significant studies as can be drawn from the evidence map (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 15)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>To our knowledge, this is the first systematic evidence map that reports on the association between cannabis use and psychosis-related outcomes across the whole psychosis continuum and moderators of that risk. The main research questions that were investigated in the reviews and meta-analyses included in our umbrella review and our conclusions about the current state of evidence are summarized in table 2. Based on this, it seems that research summarized to date has provided a clear answer to most of the questions listed, though some of the problems remain unresolved and need further investigation. Although there are issues around the methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses included here with several reviews ranging from critically low to moderate quality, they suggest a consistent association between cannabis use and most of the investigated psychosis-related outcomes across levels of the psychosis continuum from healthy individuals to patients with psychotic disorders.</p><p>Taking into account the amount and the consistency of available evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as their quality, it seems on balance that there is clear evidence in support of an association between cannabis use and psychotic-like experiences and schizotypy.</p><p>However, existing systematic reviews mostly focused on cross-sectional studies so that only an association rather than a probable causal relationship may be inferred. Future systematic reviews should therefore focus on longitudinal studies following up cohorts from before the onset of subclinical psychosis symptoms. Similarly, mostly cross-sectional studies have examined the relationship between cannabis use and the clinical-high-risk state for psychosis. Therefore, one may only infer on the prevalence of cannabis use in CHR individuals rather than the likelihood of cannabis use increasing the risk of developing a CHR state.</p><p>Another interesting outcome of our umbrella review is that the association between cannabis use and psychosis outcomes appear to be less pronounced in the CHR population. Considering all available evidence from existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as their quality, whether cannabis use is associated with increased severity of CHR symptoms or with increased transition to a psychotic disorder, remains unclear. This is intriguing when considered in light of more consistent evidence of association between cannabis use and psychosis-related outcomes in healthy individuals and those with established psychosis. Whether this reflects the possibility that the effects of cannabis use on transition to psychosis in CHR individuals is only evident in heavy cannabis users, as has been suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Kraan, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">van der Steur et al., 2020)</ref> or whether CHR cohorts in these studies, which typically recruit help-seeking individuals, are not fully representative of those at risk of transition <ref type="bibr">(van Os and Guloksuz, 2017)</ref> remains to be systematically investigated in future studies.</p><p>Furthermore, the systematic reviews and meta-analytical evidence seems to agree that cannabis use in the general population is associated with the development of clinical psychosis. The effect sizes obtained in the meta-analyses that have been published around the same time differed from each other ranging from 1.5 to 3-fold increase in odds for the cannabis user group. This is most likely due to the fact, that the authors of different reviews sometimes extracted different effectsizes (either unadjusted or adjusted for covariates or from different subgroups based on factors that they considered appropriate such as cannabis use level) from the same cohort or publication.</p><p>Reviews also differed in terms their quantitative synthesis approaches. Some combined data from cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts or observational and experimental studies or combined both the "softer" outcome of psychotic symptoms and the "harder" outcome of clinical psychosis diagnosis in the same analysis. However, when they separated those in subgroup or sensitivity analyses, it has been consistently shown that the effect-sizes were larger for association with the narrower clinical outcomes.</p><p>A major limitation of the present endeavour relates to our focus on only observational studies. As mentioned at the outset, observational study designs do not directly address the question whether any observed association between cannabis use and psychosis-related outcomes is causal in nature.</p><p>Although the language used in some of the systematic reviews implied causal effects (such as "effect of cannabis on"), only a few of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses intended to systematically address the question of whether cannabis actually causes those psychosis related outcomes by means of their evidence synthesis. Of those authors that have explored the causal question narratively by using Bradford Hill's Criteria or through discussing the plausibility of alternative non-causal theories such as the self-medication hypothesis or reverse causality, most considered the theory of cannabis as a component cause for psychosis and the existence of a bidirectional association between cannabis use and psychosis as most plausible.</p><p>From the review authors that tried to address the causality question by only including longitudinal studies in their review, none of them distinguished between primary studies using conventional analyses (such as (repeated) cross-sectional and longitudinal designs with single equation approaches) and more sophisticated advanced analytical techniques that support more robust causal interpretations such as longitudinal studies that allowed for time-varying exposure and confounder-control. Future systematic reviews and meta-analyses should therefore synthesize information from those observational studies that target key issues for causal inference such as confounding and reverse causality using appropriate study designs and more advanced statistical Considering the plurality of experimental evidence and observational evidence in healthy individuals, one may argue the case for shifting of focus from further investigations of cannabis -psychosis association to evaluation of appropriate intervention approaches to mitigate harm in those most vulnerable. This is particularly important in light of the evolving legislative landscape and societal attitudes about cannabis use across many geographical jurisdictions.</p><p>Furthermore, existing experimental data that has shown that THC further increases psychotic outcomes in clinical populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(D'Souza et al., 2005)</ref> aligns with those results of our umbrella review that indicate that adverse effects of cannabis may not be limited to the general population but may further worsen psychosis-related outcomes in clinical populations, especially in patients with established psychosis. This may have important implications for health care professionals working with people at various stages of the psychosis risk and disease continuum with history of co-occurring cannabis use disorder as well as in more general addiction or public health settings. There may be important policy implications as well of the evidence highlighted here that suggests a greater risk of poor outcome in those with heavier and persistent use such as in those having cannabis dependence. In this regard, some of the risk modifiers such as frequency and potentially potency of cannabis used as well as an earlier age of onset of cannabis use may serve as useful pointers in focusing intervention strategies on those that may be most affected.</p><p>Our umbrella review further suggests that genetic factors potentially may play role in increasing the risk of development of psychosis in cannabis users. However, the existing evidence synthesis, mostly included studies only investigating one single or maximal two nucleoid polymorphisms at a time. Future meta-analyses should therefore summarize the evidence from large-scale genomic association studies, those employing polygenic risk scores and mendelian randomization approaches. Moreover, with a hopefully increasing number of studies investigating the long-term epigenetic effects of cannabis use based on DNA-methylation and histone protein regulation data and its association with psychosis outcomes future systematic reviews and meta-analysis may aim at summarizing and quantifying this data in order to better understand the effect of interaction between genetic risk and cannabis use on psychosis-related outcomes.</p><p>Another aspect that the systematic review evidence to date fails to address, is the comorbidity of cannabis use with other psychiatric disorders in otherwise healthy individuals. Current evidence implies that cannabis use is associated with a range of other comorbid psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and depression and that cannabis users tend to self-medicate those symptoms with their use <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Gobbi et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hasin and Walsh, 2020)</ref>. However none of the reviews to date have investigated whether the presence of other comorbid psychiatric disorders may increase the vulnerability of harm from cannabis use or even act as confounder when assessing a causal relationship between cannabis use and psychosis in the general population.</p><p>The strength of this umbrella review lies in that it combines, visualizes and evaluates all available evidence across all the outcomes and subpopulations of the psychosis continuum, that have been studied to date. However, as the investigation of the psychosis continuum is still an emerging field, the terminology to describe the different dimensions of psychosis related outcomes and their measurement approaches are not yet standardized. Across the included systematic reviews and their primary studies, different terms were used for the same/similar concepts. On the other hand some terms such as "psychotic-like-experiences, "psychotic symptoms" and "psychotic experiences" were used interchangeably. Definitions were most of the time not provided and if so, measurement tools for the outcomes investigated still varied strongly across the systematic reviews and included primary studies.</p><p>In addition to the limitation with regard to the content of the existing evidence syntheses, we found that the vast majority of the currently existing systematic reviews on cannabis use and psychosis-related outcomes have a critically low methodological quality, limiting confidence in their conclusions. Only two out of 32 reviews were rated as high quality, six reviews were classified as moderate, six as low, and the remaining as critically low in quality. However, this is not as surprising, and is consistent with the quality of systematic reviews as assessed with the AMSTAR-2 in other areas of research <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Leclercq et al., 2020)</ref>. It has been argued that low quality ratings reflect the current low methodological quality and confidence in systematic reviews in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Pieper et al., 2021)</ref>. What stands out from the results of our AMSTAR-2 evaluation is that many of the included reviews neither assessed the risk of bias of included studies nor discussed the influence of study quality on the results. Others used reporting guidelines such as STROBE <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Schoeler et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ragazzi et al., 2018)</ref> to determine the quality of included studies.</p><p>Future studies may therefore use validated quality assessment or risk of bias assessment instruments and in addition follow the STROBE guidelines to evaluate the reporting quality of included reviews as it was originally intended to be used for <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Da Costa et al., 2011)</ref>. Another limitation of our approach relates to the fact that we did not ourselves estimate pooled effect-sizes using all available published data related to the questions investigated in the literature. As our overall objective was to provide a high-level summary of existing expert knowledge for the interested reader and thereby also point out the inconsistencies and gaps in evidence and their interpretation, we summarized instead the pooled effect-sizes as well as qualitative review conclusions that have been reported in published reviews and meta-analyses and provided an assessment of the methodological quality of these approaches.</p></div>

In addition, genome-wide association studies included in the latest review byCarvalho and    colleagues<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Carvalho and Vieira-Coelho, 2022)</ref> suggested that SNPs on the CHRM3 (cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3) gene and on the P2X7 (P2X purinoceptor 7) gene may play a role in the complex interaction between cannabis use and psychosis. Furthermore, qualitative evidence synthesis investigating potential moderating effects of familial predisposition and prodromal symptoms at baseline provided unclear results. Finally, mendelian randomization studies suggested a bidirectional association between cannabis use and psychosis (no pooled effect-sizes for the moderating effect of familial predisposition and mendelian randomization studies have been published in the systematic reviews to date.</figDesc></figure>
<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_2"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>analytical methods (e.g. target emulation trials, (genetic) instrumental variable methods, propensity scores, fixed-effects regression with time-varying covariates and G-methods such as G-formula, marginal structural models and G-estimation, etc.).Furthermore, meta-analyses based on individual participant data raise the potential for new opportunities of using more advanced quantitative synthesis approaches and further facilitate investigation of environmental and genetic moderators of the relationship between cannabis use and psychosis related outcomes.While experimental cannabis/ THC administration studies offer the possibility to draw causal inferences by means of the study design, those carried out to date have generally examined transient psychosis-related outcomes. Arguably, they offer only limited evidence with regard to questions regarding the association between cannabis use and non-transient psychosis-related outcomes such as onset of a psychotic episode or its relapse. Although, we did not synthesize available evidence regarding the acute and transient effects of cannabis as examined under experimental conditions, it is worth noting that the results summarized herein broadly align with a recent systematic review of experimental studies investigating the acute and transient psychotomimetic effects of THC. For example, the most recent review byHindley and    colleagues<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hindley et al., 2020)</ref> synthesized evidence from experimental studies involving oral or inhaled administration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis in healthy human participants. They reported that THC administration was associated with transient psychotic symptoms, with stronger effects for positive compared to negative psychotic symptoms."</figDesc></figure>
