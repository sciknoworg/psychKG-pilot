			<abstract>
				<p>The latest DSM-5-TR revision included independent diagnostic codes for Suicidal and Non-Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB), emphasizing the need to differentiate subtypes. However, research on individuals who have experienced both Suicidal and Non-Suicidal SIB remains limited. This lack of understanding may hinder the recognition of a distinct subgroup within the SIB population, making it difficult to identify their unique characteristics. This study utilized the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) to investigate risk decision-making patterns across four groups: Major Depressive Disorder patients with history of Suicidal SIB (MDD-SA), Non-Suicidal (MDD-NSSI), both types of SIB (MDD-Both), and a Healthy Control group (HC). Our findings revealed distinct risk-decision-making patterns in the learning curve of Cash RT. This potentially indicated features of indecisive decision-making. These pieces of evidence may significantly benefit both research and clinical communities. First, time-dimensional indices, particularly Cash RT in BART, appear to be promising discriminative markers. Additionally, at the clinical level, the distinct risk decision-making patterns observed align with the new DSM-5-TR diagnostic framework. Importantly, our findings suggest that individuals with history of combined type of SIB may be considered as an independent subgroup deserving focused attention. Future studies may elucidate the underlying mechanisms of these risk decision-making pattern differences.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Suicide remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide (World Health <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Organization, 2023)</ref>. Despite this, there is still no consensus on a comprehensive framework elucidating why individuals act against their innate survival instinct. Along with the inherent complexity of suicide, inconsistent definitions of suicidal phenomena contribute to the issue and have been identified as a prominent problem in the field of suicidology <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Goldsmith et al., 2002)</ref>. Reflecting this issue, in 2022, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) introduced diagnostic codes for Suicidal and Non-Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB) in the Fifth Text Revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR), emphasizing the importance of distinguishing different subtypes of SIB (APA, 2022).</p><p>Self-Injurious Behavior (SIB) is defined as 'behavior that is self-directed and deliberately results in injury or the potential for injury to oneself' <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Crosby et al., 2011)</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr">De Leo et al. (2021)</ref>, SIB can result from different genres of intentions. Individuals may engage in SIB with zero intent to die (Non-Suicidal SIB) or with nonzero intent to die (Suicidal SIB). The distinction between Suicidal and Non-Suicidal SIB hinges on such intentions. While DSM-5-TR has formally separated Suicidal SIB from Non-Suicidal SIB in its diagnostic framework, there remains a subgroup of individuals who have experienced in both forms SIB throughout their lifetime. This subgroup not only engaged in Non-Suicidal SIB but had also engaged in SIB with a clear intent to end their life, indicating a shift in their intentions toward death as well as the purposes of SIB over time.</p><p>Unfortunately, research on the unique and shared characteristics of individuals with Suicidal, Non-Suicidal, as well as those with combined type of SIB is limited. To our knowledge, only a few studies had investigated the characteristics of individuals with combined type of SIB <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dougherty et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Muehlenkamp &amp; Gutierrez, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Nock, 2014)</ref>. This lack of understanding may prevent us from recognizing a distinct subgroup of SIB individuals, leading to a narrow focus on SIB only as a state per se. This perspective overlooks the broader context of an individual's SIB history, hindering our ability to disentangle the mechanisms behind different forms of SIB and to understand the transitions between Non-Suicidal and Suicidal SIB, whether in one direction or the other. Distinguishing different subtypes of SIB is also crucial in clinical settings, as each may require distinct treatments and prevention strategies.</p><p>The significance of decision-making characteristics in shaping an individual's motivations and intentions has been emphasized across disciplines <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gigerenzer, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 2013)</ref>. The Psychache Theory of Suicide further proposed that while depression and hopelessness-common risk factors for suicide-are associated with accumulating psychological pain ('psychache'), decision-making processes of avoiding 'psychache' may be the core mechanisms and serve as more direct drivers of SIB <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Shneidman, 1993)</ref>. Over the past decade, studies have been investigating the decision-making properties of individuals with SIB using behavioral paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Sastre-Buades et al., 2021)</ref>. Empirical evidence from past studies shows a variety of decision-making features in SIB individuals, including pain avoidance, shortsightedness, and risk-seeking behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Dillahunt et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jollant et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Ortin et al., 2012)</ref>. So far, no consensus was established on a specific decision-making framework. In addition to the lack of systematic comparisons among different SIB subgroups mentioned earlier, another contributing factor could be the "task impurity" of behavioral paradigms. These paradigms often assess multiple cognitive dimensions simultaneously, making it difficult to determine which specific aspect of decision-making is being measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bredemeier &amp; Miller, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>), developed by <ref type="bibr">Lejuez et al.</ref>, is a behavioral paradigm that evaluates individuals' risk decision-making behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lejuez et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Van Ravenzwaaij et al., 2011)</ref>. Unlike self-reported questionnaires, this dynamic behavioral paradigm reflects implicit, timerelated decision-making patterns and immerses participants in a risky, realistic environment. The BART is particular advantageous because of its straightforward design. Participants interact with a single target stimulus (a balloon) and make only two types of choices: whether to continue inflating the balloon or stop. Such design is beneficial for both experimental and clinical purposes: unlike the Iowa Gambling Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bechara et al., 1994)</ref> which simultaneously measuring multiple aspects of executive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gansler et al., 2011)</ref>, BART focuses solely on risk-taking behavior, minimizing the confounding influence of "task impurity." Additionally, the simplicity of the task rules enhances participants' understanding and motivation to engage in the task.</p><p>The available evidence has several limitations. Although few studies had explored MDD-SIB's performance on BART, the type of MDD-SIB patients evaluated in the current MDD-SIB-BART literature by far mainly restricted within the MDD-SA type. Comparisons have only been made between the MDD-SA and MDD-only group <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fang et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ji et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ji et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liu et al., 2022)</ref>. Additionally, current literature mostly examined their performance in traditional BART indices, overlooking other important indices such as reaction time and learning curves (Van Zandt, 2002) which could be important measures set to investigated hypotheses about mental processing. <ref type="bibr">Gu and colleagues (2018)</ref> had examined the two different decision's reaction time separately, as it represents distinct two types of risk decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gu et al., 2018)</ref>. Pump RT in BART reflects the time participants take to decide whether to continue inflating the balloon, potentially indicating their decisiveness in pursuing expected values despite the risk of explosion. Cash RT reflects the time participants take to decide whether to stop pumping, potentially indicating their reluctance to forgo the chance of gaining more points. A longer Cash RT may suggest hesitation or other influential decision-making factors requiring extended consideration. Learning curve which demonstrates the relationship between practice and associated changes in behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Speelman &amp; Kirsner, 2005)</ref>, were also less examined. It reflects how participants adapt their decision-making strategies over time based on feedback from previous trials. As participants gain experience with the task, they may adjust their risk-taking behavior-either becoming more cautious or more risk-seeking-depending on how they interpret the outcomes (e.g., balloon explosions or successful point accumulation). The learning curve can indicate how they integrate previous experiences to optimize future decisions.</p><p>In sum, there is limited understanding of the features among individuals with history of Suicidal, Non-Suicidal, and combined types of SIB. Unraveling the underlying mechanisms remains a critical challenge for both research and clinical communities. The primary aim of the current study is to investigate whether individuals with a history of different forms of SIB exhibit distinct decision-making patterns. We assess the performance of MDD-SIB individuals with histories of Suicidal, Non-Suicidal, and combined types of SIB, and their healthy counterparts, on the BART. Particularly, in addition to traditional BART indices, we recorded and analyzed time-dimensional measures (i.e., Cash RT, Pump RT, and learning curves), to gain deeper insights into participants' each decision-making actions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participants.</head><p>All procedures were approved by Institutional Ethical Board of the Kaohsiung Kai-Syuan Psychiatric Hospital (KSPH-2021-15) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. A total of 108 (78 female, 30 male) participants were recruited in this study. Seventy-six patients with MDD were recruited from the outpatient clinic as well as the acute psychiatric wards of the Kaohsiung Municipal Kai-Syuan Psychiatric Hospital. The inclusion criteria for participants with MDD were: (i) a diagnosis of MDD by a psychiatrist; (ii) ages between 20 to 85 years old; (iii) had at least one SIB history during his/her lifetime; (iv) no mental deficiency, organic brain disorder, or history of severe head trauma. According to our research criteria (see 2.2.1 for details), the sample of 78 patients with MDD was divided into three groups: (i) patients with only non-suicidal SIB history, referred to as MDD patients with Non-Suicidal Self-Injuries (the MDD-NSSI Group; n = 30); (ii) patients with only suicidal SIB history, referred to as MDD patients with Suicidal Attempts (the MDD-SA Group; n = 21); and (iii) patients with history of both Suicidal and Non-Suicidal SIB, referred to as MDD patients with both types of SIB (the MDD-Both Group; n = 25). A group of Healthy Control participants (the HC Group; n = 32) was recruited from local communities. The inclusion criteria for the HC group were: (i) no history of mental disorders; (ii) ages between 20 to 85 years old; (iii) no self-injurious behavior history during his/her lifetime; (iv) no mental deficiency, organic brain disorder, or history of severe head trauma.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">History of SIB Questionnaire</head><p>History of SIB related information was collected through a brief questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of selected questions from the Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behavior Interview-Short Form <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fox et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Nock et al., 2007)</ref>. The first part of the questionnaire began with asking two questions: (Question A) "Have you ever made an actual attempt to kill yourself in which you had at least some intent to die?" and (Question B) "Have you ever had thoughts of purposely hurting yourself without wanting to die?". If only the answer to Question A were affirmative, then the participant would be categorized as the MDD-SA Group; if only the answer to Question B were affirmative, then the participant would be categorized as the MDD-NSSI Group; if answers to Question A and B were both affirmative, then the participant would be categorized as the MDD-Both Group. The second part of the questionnaire assesses other SIB characteristics including thoughts during SIB, frequency of SIB, total counts of SIB, age of first SIB, days from last SIB, and SIB methods. The questionnaire was translated in Traditional-Chinese by the authors (see supplementary materials).</p></div>

The questionnaire consists of 30 items, each rated on a four-point scale, with scores ranging from 0 to 3. In this study, we used the Traditional-Chinese version (BIS-11) translated by Sue-Huei Chen, Ph.D. The internal consistency was 0.83 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Li &amp; Chen, 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.5">Pierce Suicide Intent Scale (PSIS)</head><p>The PSIS is used to assess the degree of suicidal intent. Three subscales were measured: "circumstance," "subjective feelings," and "other risk factors" <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Pierce, 1981)</ref>. The questionnaire consists of 12 items, each rated on a three-point scale, with scores ranging from 0 to 2. The PSIS total score ranges from 0 to 25, with higher scores reflecting greater suicidal intent. Specifically, scores from 0 to 3 indicate low intent, while scores from 4 to 10 suggest moderate intent, and scores from 10 to 25 indicate high intent. In this study, we used the Traditional-Chinese version of PSIS provided by Taoyuan Psychiatric Center, Ministry of Health and Welfare. The internal consistency of the English version is 0.77 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sisask et al., 2009</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.6">Beck Lethality Scale (LS)</head><p>The Beck Lethality Scale (LS) is used to assess the medical lethality of SIB. The questionnaire was translated in Traditional-Chinese by the authors. Eight possible suicidal methods were listed in the LS, including sedative drugs, non-sedative drugs and other substances, shooting, immolation, drowning, cutting, jumping, and hanging <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beck et al., 1975)</ref>. One of eight separate subscales would be assessed according to the method of participants' last SIB. The lethality level of his/her last SIB are rated on an ordinal scale, with scores ranging from 0 (no or minimal damage) to 8 (death). In the case where participants' last SIB did not fall into any of the subscales, it would be categorized into the ninth subscales which were listed as "other methods". The LS of participants' last SIB is completed by an interviewer base on participants' self-reported information regarding the objective medical care they were given, the description of the injury, as well as information from the medical records. The interrater reliability of the English version of LS is 0.80 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lester &amp; Beck, 1975</ref>).</p></div>

Participants are instructed to press either the "pump" button or the "cash" button to continue the experiment, using either a touchscreen or a mouse. The entire task typically takes about 10-15 minutes to complete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Procedures</head><p>After study description, informed written consents were provided to all participants. All participants completed questionnaires of demographic information, Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and the computerized BART task; three patient groups additionally completed the History of SIBs questionnaire, Beck Lethality Scale, and Pierce Suicide Intent Scale. The questionnaires and BART task were randomly administered, and participants completed all measures in 30-45 minutes. Following the completion of all measures, all participants were compensated with a participation fee of NT$100. All data was anonymized for confidentiality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Data Analysis</head><p>The analysis of current study is done in three parts. First, age, BDI, and BIS among four groups were analyzed using two-tailed independent sample t-tests; due to significant results of homogeneity of variance test (Levene's &lt; .000), the original BDI scores were transformed using square root transformation. In addition, chi-square tests were used to analyze gender and education level. Second, five traditional BART indices included BART Score, total number of burst, average pump counts, average pump after bursts, and total scores were analyzed using the one-way independent sample analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) to control for the significant age differences. Learning curves of BART Scores were also investigated using the repeated-measures two-way mixed design ANOVA. Third, new BART indices including RT of different risk decision (Rump RT and Cash RT) and their learning curves were investigated. Due to the non-normal distribution nature of the RT data, we applied the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) for the analysis. The GLMM was configured with intercept, block (first, second vs. third block), group and group × block interaction as four fixed factors, subject, age of subjects as a random factor, and the RT distribution was considered as inverse Gaussian <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gu et al., 2018)</ref>. In this study, both the identity and power (-1) link function between the predictors and RT were explored to compare its goodness of fit. We applied Greenhouse-Geisser correction for ANOVA tests, Bonferroni method (or sequential Bonferroni in GLMM) for post hoc testing, and the simple effects model for significant interaction analyses. Data were analyzed using SPSS (Version: 27.0), MATLAB (Version: 9.14.0 R2023a) and JASP (Version: 0.18.3). The task begins with a balloon presented at the center of the screen. At the bottom of the screen, two buttons of options are presented, one is to "pump", the other is to "cash." The participant can inflate the balloon by clicking the pump button, with each click making the balloon appear larger, simulating the effect of adding air to a virtual balloon. Although the maximum number of pumps is 128 (as shown on the top), this limit is not disclosed to the participants. The participants can earn 1 point (score) per each inflation. At the right portion of the screen, the total score the participant had earned so far as well as the score earned from the previous balloon are displayed. However, as informed, the balloon is designed to burst after a random number of inflations.</p><p>The participants had no way of knowing when the balloon will explode. The participants can stop inflating the balloon by clicking the cash button. Hence, the participant can decide whether to click the "cash" button at any time or to stop inflating and settle the current accumulated score for this balloon. If the balloon bursts before the settlement, all accumulated points would be lost (as shown in red frames). Since the participants have no information about when the balloon would explode, the participant must decide when to stop inflating the balloon to get as many total points as he/she can. The whole task contains total of 30 balloons (as shown on the left axis). and Cash RT were examined across three blocks: the first 10 balloons (Block 1), the 11th to 20th balloons (Block 2), and the 21st to 30th balloons (Block 3).</p></div>

As the MDD-Both group gained more experience with the balloons, their Cash RT did not decrease like in the other groups; instead, it tended to slow down. </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Between-Group Effects (Group) Variables Frequency Domain X V X BART Score X Total Burst X Average Pump X Average PAB Score Domain X Total Score RT Domain X V X Pump RT V V Ｖ Cash RT</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Depression and Impulsivity</head><p>Our results showed that the depression score in HC group is significantly lower than those of the patient groups; yet no depression level differences were found among different subgroups of MDD-SIB patients. Similarly, no impulsivity level differences were shown among the patient groups, but they were all more impulsive than the HC group. The results suggest that although individuals with MDD-SIB may exhibit higher levels of depression and impulsivity compared to healthy individuals, the specific form of SIB in MDD does not result in differences in impulsivity or depression levels. These results are consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ji et al. (2021)</ref>, except that our study additionally included the MDD-NSSI group and showed no differences in depression and impulsivity compared to other patient groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Ji et al., 2021)</ref>. These results are particularly meaningful as they demonstrate that these two commonly perceived risk factors for suicide may not be the direct mechanistic factors that differentiate between non-suicidal, suicidal, and both types of SIB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Performance on BART</head><p>To our knowledge, this study is perhaps the first to conduct such a comprehensive comparison on the BART among three forms of MDD-SIB patients; the current study is perhaps also the first to evaluate their performances upon the two new BART indices (both RT and learning curves). The absence of group differences in the traditional BART indices suggests that not only did the three MDD-SIB groups perform similarly on these traditional indices, but there were also no differences between the patient groups and their healthy counterparts. Although these results differ from those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ji et al. (2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Ji et al. ( , 2022</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liu et al. (2022)</ref>, in which they found a lower BART Score in MDD-SA <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ji et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ji et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Liu et al., 2022)</ref>, the discrepancy may be attributed to the fact that the above studies used a modified, shorter version of the BART. Previous research showed that variations in risk versions influence participants' response patterns. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Plinio et al. (2022)</ref> recommended risk versions with 10-16 maximum explosion probabilities, non-stochastic versions, or higher inflation versions with more trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Di Plinio et al., 2022)</ref>. However, <ref type="bibr">Tsai (2018)</ref> found that different risk versions (maximum explosion probabilities of 8, 16, 32, 64, 96, 120) significantly affected participants' risk-taking behavior. Lower versions prompted participants to cease inflating earlier, whereas higher versions resulted in participant fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Tsai, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Although comparable performance on traditional indices suggests all participants employed similar strategies to achieve high scores in BART, with no apparent strategic differences at an explicit level, our findings from RT and learning curves revealed differential cognitive processes. First, from the sight of overall reaction time, the HC group demonstrated significant shorter overall reaction times than all three MDD-SIB groups when deciding to Cash Out. Second, from a wholistic view throughout the entire task, significant interactions between block and group were observed also from the reaction times of the Cash Out decisions. Specifically, although all groups show higher BART Scores and shorter Pump RT toward the later stage of the task, significant shorter Cash RT were only observed in the HC, followed by the MDD-NSSI group. On the other hand, such learning effect in Cash RT was not observed in either the MDD-SA or MDD-Both groups (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">figure 5)</ref>.</p><p>At first glance, the different results in Pump versus Cash RT may seem counterintuitive. The difference may be because participants press the "Pump" button automatically to reach his/her certain expected value, while deciding to press the "Cash" button requires more conscious deliberation (W-S. <ref type="bibr">Tsai, personal communication, July 27, 2024)</ref>. The underlying mechanisms of the differential Cash RT decision-making patterns observed in current study remained unsolved. Faster Cash RT in the MDD-NSSI and HC groups may indicate less hesitation towards later stage of the task, which may suggest reduced emotional engagement; in contrast, tendency of longer Cash RT indicates increased hesitation and may imply elevated emotional investments. Such indecisiveness could also be related to deficits in executive functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bredemeier &amp; Miller, 2015)</ref>, differential Cash RT patterns may be associated with updating and shifting deficits to according to <ref type="bibr">Miyake et al. framework (Miyake et al., 2000)</ref>. Possibly, the slower RT trend in making Cash Out decisions in the MDD-Both Group might appear to reflect caution towards punishments or a motivation to avoid forfeiting accumulated points, suggesting a tendency to avoid negative outcomes. Alternatively, slower RT in Cash decisions but faster RT in Pump decisions may indicate a tendency to seek more stimulation or engage in greater risks. From the qualitative perspective a participant from the MDD-Both group expressed enjoyment of the "explosion/destructive feeling" and refrained from cashing out any balloons (C. Ho, personal communication, July 27, 2024).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">The MDD-Both Group</head><p>Our findings revealed while all groups began with relatively slower Cash RT, only MDD-Both exhibited a further slowdown towards the end of the task, highlighting distinct dynamic adjustment decisionmaking pattern in the MDD-Both group. Few studies had reported that individuals with combined type of SIB (involving both NSSI and SA) exhibit higher levels of anxiety, depression, impulsivity, fewer reasons for living, aggression, hopelessness, suicidal ideation compared to those engaging in either NSSI or SA alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dougherty et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Muehlenkamp &amp; Gutierrez, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stanley et al., 2001</ref>), suggesting more severe clinical features in these individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hamza et al., 2012)</ref>. Given these findings, we recommend further studies to explore whether individuals in the MDD-Both subgroup should be considered a more severe form of SIB, warranting specialized treatment approaches.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Limitations</head><p>This study has several limitations. First, there were significant age differences within the sample: the control group was significantly older than the MDD-NSSI and MDD-Both groups, and the MDD-SA group was older than the MDD-Both group. Although age was controlled using covariance analysis, and random effects, future MDD-SIB-BART research should aim to minimize these age discrepancies. Second, suiciderelated data were collected through retrospective self-reports, which are prone to biases like hindsight, recall errors, and informant inaccuracies. Future studies should consider examining current episodes or collaborating with medical teams for more accurate assessments. Furthermore, due to limited time resource, current research had not included group of MDD patients without any types of SIB history, future studies may include such group to explore whether the results in current study are particularly a SIB related features. In addition, while most participants used a touchscreen during the BART task, a few used a mouse. This variation could introduce confounding factors, highlighting the need for a more controlled experimental design. Finally, the small sample size limits the generalizability of these findings, therefore, replication in larger clinical samples is necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In sum, differences in risk decision-making patterns were observed among individuals with history of Suicidal, Non-Suicidal, those with combined type of SIB, and their healthy counterparts. However, whether these differences stem from pain avoidance, as posited by the Psychache Theory of Suicide, or other motivators (i.e., risk seeking) requires further clarification in future research. Methodology-wise, our results suggest that time-based BART indices are essential to reveal substantial differences MDD-SIB in participants. More specifically, our findings highlight that the reaction times of the "Cash Out" decisions appear to be a promising discriminative index. Clinically, the risk decision-making patterns of the MDD-Both group were notably different, suggesting a necessity to treat the MDD-Both as an independent subgroup.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>illustrated the process of BART.</figDesc></figure>
