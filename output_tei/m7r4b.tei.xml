			<abstract>
				<p>Acute stress causes numerous physiological and psychological changes in humans, such as increased levels of cortisol and negative affect. To date, few studies have examined the effects of acute stress on objective decisions. To fill this gap, we conducted a within-participants laboratory experiment in which young adults made decisions of varying computational hardness under an acute stress and a placebo protocol. We find that higher cortisol levels, induced via the Trier Social Stress Test, drive impaired decision quality independent of the level of computational hardness. Among participants with significant increases in cortisol, we observe a reduction in decision quality and an increase in the rate of &apos;timing out&apos; (using the maximum available time on a decision). Ex-post, we observe that the largest deficits in decision quality were on trials that &apos;timed out&apos; in the stress condition. As important life decisions, such as financial decisions, are often made when experiencing acute stress, these results may have implications for the design of organisational and public policy.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Many critical decisions in life are complex and made when under high levels of acute stress.</p><p>Examples include whether to evacuate during a natural disaster, whether to obtain a loan in a financial emergency, and whether to proceed with a risky medical treatment in a medical emergency. At present, little is known about how acute stress affects complex decisions.</p><p>Stress is a ubiquitous experience occurring when a situation's behavioural or physiological demands exceed an organism's regulatory capacity <ref type="bibr">(Koolhaas et al., 2011)</ref>. Acute, or 'in the moment' stress, triggers substantial physiological and psychological changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Sapolsky, Romero, &amp; Munck, 2000)</ref>. Physiologically, the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary (SAM) axis activates the fight-or-flight response; heart rate and perspiration increasing within seconds of stress onset and returning to baseline within minutes post-stressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Starcke &amp; Brand, 2012)</ref>. In parallel, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis instigates a slower stress response, releasing glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, to mobilise energy stores and inhibit non-essential functions such as digestion <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Rodrigues, LeDoux, &amp; Sapolsky, 2009)</ref>. Cortisol levels increase within minutes of stress onset and remain elevated for 40-60 minutes post-stressor <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Starcke &amp; Brand, 2012)</ref>. Several brain regions show significant changes in activation under stress, leading to changes in behaviour which are adaptive in circumstances of fight-or-flight, but whose effects are less obvious in other decision-making contexts. Three brain regions particularly affected by acute stress include the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lupien, Juster, Raymond, &amp; Marin, 2018)</ref>. The prefrontal cortex has been implicated in impaired performance under stress on tasks requiring complex and flexible thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnsten, 2009)</ref>. However, other studies have found shifts from serial-to-parallel processing <ref type="bibr">(Gathmann et al., 2014)</ref> or a reallocation of cognitive resources that leads to performance at least as good <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Qin, Hermans, van Marle, Luo, &amp; Fernández, 2009)</ref>, or better <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Dierolf, Fechtner, Böhnke, Wolf, &amp; Naumann, 2017)</ref>, than that without stress. Thus, it appears that, depending on the task and the decision context, acute stress can lead to either impairments in functioning or a more efficient use of cognitive resources that preserves good performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Plieger et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Psychologically, acute stress can be accompanied by states such as heightened alertness, fear or anxiety <ref type="bibr">(Grace et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sandi, 2013)</ref>. There is a growing consensus that acute stress impairs working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Schoofs, Preuß, &amp; Wolf, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Shields, Bonner, &amp; Moons, 2015)</ref>, cognitive flexibility, and planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Johnson, Dariotis, &amp; Wang, 2012)</ref>; while enhancing inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Shields et al., 2015)</ref>, and learning from negative feedback or stress-relevant contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Schwabe, Wolf, &amp; Oitzl, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Yu, 2016)</ref>. However, moderators are critical, with results varying with, for example, levels of chronic stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Knauft, Waldron, Mathur, &amp; Kalia, 2021)</ref>, stressor perception and timing <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gabrys, Howell, Cebulski, Anisman, &amp; Matheson, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Geißler, Friehs, Frings, &amp; Domes, 2023)</ref>, or the type of flexibility or inhibition being measured <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Goldfarb, Froböse, Cools, &amp; Phelps, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Shields, Trainor, Lam, &amp; Yonelinas, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, acute stress' effect tends to be impairing in probabilistic settings such as risky, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Duque, Cano-López, &amp; Puig-Pérez, 2022)</ref>, two-stage choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Otto, Raio, Chiang, Phelps, &amp; Daw, 2013)</ref>, and explore/exploit tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lenow, Constantino, Daw, &amp; Phelps, 2017</ref>). Yet, there seem to be little or mixed effects with regards to choice consistency <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Nitsch, Sellitto, &amp; Kalenscher, 2021)</ref> and hypothetical real-world scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Duque et al., 2022)</ref>. This makes it difficult to generalise from these studies to decision-making, particularly to situations of higher complexity.</p><p>Here, we investigate the effect of acute stress on decision time and the quality of decisions of varying levels of complexity. Participants completed the knapsack decision task (KDT; see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> for details), a combinatorial computational problem based on the decision variant of the 0 − 1 knapsack problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kellerer, Pferschy, &amp; Pisinger, 2004)</ref>. It is closely related to the optimisation variant of the problem, where the objective is to determine the set of items that maximise value without exceeding the capacity constraint, and to the standard consumer choice problem in decision theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Gilboa, Postlewaite, &amp; Schmeidler, 2021)</ref>. It approximates complex decision-making by recruiting several cognitive processes, including working memory, attention, cognitive control, and cognitive flexibility, and can be used to model any decision scenario involving costs and benefits: from grocery shopping to investment management <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Murawski &amp; Bossaerts, 2016)</ref>. Furthermore, the KDT is an objective task where we are free of Inter-trial-interval</p></div>

A capacity constraint, target profit, and timer are shown at the screen's center. The goal is to decide whether there exists a subset of items for which (1) the sum of weights is lower or equal to the capacity constraint; and (2) the sum of values is at least the target profit.

Thus, our use of computational problems does not simply apply stress research to a novel setting. Rather, it</p><p>is an altogether more appropriate setting, relative to alternatives such as perceptual, executive functioning, or probabilistic tasks; for behavioural scientists interested in measuring and manipulating a decision's complexity in a generalisable, theoretically sound, and empirically validated way.</p><p>Each participant (n = 42) completed two sessions. In one, they underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; stress session) and in the other the placebo-TSST (control session) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Het, Rohleder, Schoofs, Kirschbaum, &amp; Wolf, 2009)</ref>. We collected salivary cortisol, skin conductance level (SCL), self-reported stress measures, and gaze tracking data in addition to 72 decisions in the KDT (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> for session outline). Our design allows us to quantify and manipulate both decision-makers' stress levels, via the TSST, and the computational hardness of a decision. Our main hypothesis was that acute stress would reduce decision quality, and particularly so on harder instances of the task.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Timeline of a typical experimental session. Five salivary cortisol samples and five iterations of the positive affect negative affect schedule (PANAS) were collected. Skin conductance level (SCL) was analysed for the rest period and the stress intervention, which was either the TSST (stress session) or placebo TSST (control session). Gaze tracking was recorded during the knapsack task. All timings, except where noted, were identical across all participants and sessions.ˆSelf-paced with a fixed start time. *Self-paced with a fixed end time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Efficacy of acute stress manipulation</head><p>When investigating the effects of acute stress, we always considered two samples: the full sample (n = 41 after excluding one cortisol outlier) and the subset whose baseline-to-peak salivary cortisol increased significantly in the stress session relative to the control (cortisol responders, n = 27). Unless otherwise specified, the remainder of the results reported are only for cortisol responders, with results for the full sample reported in the Supplementary Information. To verify that the acute stress manipulation was successful, we performed paired t-tests on each of the stress measures collected. All stress measures were higher in the stress condition <ref type="table">(Table S1</ref>).</p><p>We adopted the logarithm of the change in cortisol level (log cort ∆), a common measure of the cortisol response to stress, as our primary stress measure 1 (see Methods for details) <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Lenow et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Lighthall, Gorlick, Schoeke, Frank, &amp; Mather, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Otto et al., 2013)</ref>. To verify that log cort ∆ was representative of a broader stress response, we correlated it with our other stress measures. There were significant correlations between log cort ∆ and the binary stress condition variable (r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.001), and area under the cortisol response curve with respect to ground (AUCg; r = 0.64, p &lt; 0.001), and increase (AUCi; r = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001),</p><p>respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Pruessner, Kirschbaum, Meinlschmid, &amp; Hellhammer, 2003)</ref>. There were no significant correlations with perceived stress, negative affect (NA), pupil diameter, or SCL.</p><p>To verify that changes in cortisol, NA, and SCL occurred after the stress intervention, we plotted their time courses for the full sample. Cortisol and NA levels were not significantly different across the two conditions at baseline ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3A and B</ref>). Both increased significantly after the stress intervention in the stress, but not the control, session. For cortisol levels, this group difference persisted for the remainder of the session, while for NA the difference only persisted for the first two samples post-intervention. The difference between SCL in the stress intervention and the baseline rest period also increased in the stress session relative to the control condition ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3D</ref>). Further, pupil diameter was significantly higher for the stress session during the first block of trials ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 3C)</ref>, those nearest the stress intervention, before dropping to a similar level for the remainder of the session. Thus, the changes in cortisol, NA, SCL, and pupil diameter occurred following the stress intervention.  <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Efficacy of stress manipulation. All data relate to the full sample of participants. A: Mean cortisol levels over time for the stress and control sessions. B: Mean negative affect levels over time for the stress and control sessions. C: Mean pupil diameter by block for the stress and control sessions. Each block of the KDT had 12 trials, with 3 of each possible combination of {satisfiable vs unsatisfiable} and {low vs high computational hardness}. Note, a satisfiable (unsatisfiable) trial is one where the correct solution is Yes (No). D: Mean skin conductance levels for the stress and control sessions. The counterfactual shows what the SCL would have been for the stress session during the stress intervention if it had risen by the same amount observed in the control session.

We found a significant and positive stress condition × sample number interaction (β = 0.80, CI 95 = [0.41, 1.18], p &lt; 0.001), while the remaining variables all failed to reach significance. Thus, cortisol levels increased over time in the stress session, over and above any corresponding changes in the control session.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of higher cortisol levels on behaviour</head><p>All but one participant completed all 144 trials of the KDT, instead completing 143 trials. In the KDT, participants were presented with a set of items of different values and weights, a capacity constraint, and a target profit (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Participants had to indicate whether there exists a combination of items whose combined value is at least the target profit and whose combined weight is at most the capacity constraint. An instance in which there exists a combination of items that satisfies both constraints is referred to as satisfiable; otherwise, it is called unsatisfiable.</p><p>Trials were evenly sampled from a 2x2 grid built from two variables: satisfiability and instance complexity (IC), our measure of computational hardness (see Methods for details).</p><p>The latter was categorised, based on the median, as either easy (low computational hardness) or hard (high computational hardness). Averaged across sessions and considering the full sample, the mean accuracy was 78.3% (standard deviation (SD) = 8.2%) for all trials, 88.1% (SD = 9.2%) for easy trials, 68.5% for hard trials (SD = 10.5%), 77.5% for satisfiable trials (SD = 10.1%), and 79.0% for unsatisfiable trials (SD = 12.9%). The mean time on task was 31.3 seconds (SD = 5.3) for all trials, 29.7 seconds (SD = 5.5) for easy trials, 33.0 seconds (SD = 5.4) for hard trials, 30.0 seconds (SD = 5.8) for satisfiable trials, and 32.7 seconds (SD = 5.3) for unsatisfiable trials.</p><p>All behavioural analyses included IC and satisfiability as binary variables, with 0 denoting easy instances and unsatisfiable instances, respectively; and 1 denoting hard instances and satisfiable instances, respectively. All models were mixed effects with random intercepts for participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of higher cortisol levels on decision time in the KDT</head><p>To examine the effect of acute stress on decision time, we estimated a mixed-effects oneinflated beta regression, regressing time on task (measured as a proportion of the maximum available time) onto log cort ∆, IC, a log cort ∆ × IC interaction, satisfiability, sex, session number, and z-scored trial number (AIC: 1,546.9). There was no significant effect of the interaction term or sex, and the AIC improved when these variables were removed (AIC: 1,541.6). On the beta regression we observed significant and positive effects of IC (β = (β = 1.00, CI 95 = [0.83, 1.18], p &lt; 0.001). Thus, higher cortisol levels were associated with 'timing out' and using the maximum 40 seconds available more often. However, conditional on not timing out, higher cortisol levels had no effect on decision time (see <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). In total, participants timed out on over a third of trials 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of higher cortisol levels on decision quality in the KDT</head><p>To test the effect of acute stress on decision quality, we estimated a logistic mixed-effects model regressing accuracy onto log cort ∆, IC, a log cort ∆ × IC interaction, satisfiability, sex, zscored trial number, and session number (AIC: 3,647.2). Time on task was omitted due to confounds with the IC and stress measures. There was no significant effect of the interaction term, trial number or sex and the AIC improved when these variables were removed (AIC: 3,644.4).  <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>). This result implies a marginal effect whereby a one standard deviation increase in log cort ∆ is associated with a 1.7 percentage point (2%) reduction in accuracy.</p><p>Next, we examined accuracy separately for trials in which participants timed out, as these were trials where participants were maximally time-constrained. Thus, they may represent trials where stress' impairing effect is largest and, in a post-hoc analysis, we explored whether there was an interaction effect of acute stress and time pressure on accuracy among cortisol responders. To test this, we first ran a series of unpaired t-tests. Firstly, we compared accuracy on trials that timed out with those that did not and found that accuracy was significantly lower on trials that timed out (µ dif f = −11.80%, CI 95 = [−14.56%, −9.04%], p &lt; 0.001). Secondly, we compared accuracy among trials that timed out across stress conditions and found significantly lower accuracy under stress (µ dif f = −5.69%, CI 95 = [−10.39%, −0.01%], p = 0.017).</p><p>Thirdly, we compared accuracy among trials that did not time-out across stress conditions and found no significant difference. Fourthly, we found that the effect of time-out and stress was  <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Summary of regression results for decision quality and decision time. Coefficients for the best fitting models for predicting accuracy and time on task. The time on task model is a one-inflated beta regression with two component parts visualised separately, namely the conditional model (beta regression) and the one-inflation model (logistic regression). The best fitting model for accuracy did not include trial number as a regressor. The coefficients for the interaction between computational hardness and log cort ∆ are taken from separate models, as the interaction term was excluded from the best fitting models. Error bars represent standard errors. * p &lt; 0.05, ** p &lt; 0.01, *** p &lt; 0.001, NS p &gt; 0.1 related to the satisfiability of the trial ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref> and <ref type="table">Table S2</ref>). Specifically, the impairing effect of stress was largest for satisfiable trials that timed out. Finally, we compared whether the type of trial participants timed out on differed between stress conditions. For each possible combination of computational hardness and satisfiability, we found no significant difference in time-outs between the stress and control conditions (p &gt; 0.17 in all cases).</p><p>To verify the effects apparent in <ref type="figure">Figure 5A</ref> and B, we estimated a mixed-effects logistic regression. We regressed accuracy onto log cort ∆, time-out status, IC, satisfiability, session number, a log cort ∆× satisfiability interaction, a time-out status × satisfiability interaction, a log cort ∆× satisfiability × time-out status interaction, and a log cort ∆× time-out status interaction (AIC: 3,574.6). The model fit improved when the time-out status × satisfiability Participant used the maximum available time on a trial (40s) <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Mean accuracy, dwell times, and visit rate split by stress condition, time-out status, and trial satisfiability. A: Mean accuracy on satisfiable trials (solution is Yes), split by time-out status and stress condition. B: Mean accuracy on unsatisfiable trials (solution is No), split by time-out status and stress condition. C: Mean dwell time on an area of interest, split by time-out status and stress condition. D: Mean visit rate (visits to areas of interest per second), split by time-out status and stress condition. Note, 36.1% of all trials timed out, meaning the participant used the maximum 40 seconds available rather than submitting an early solution. Error bars represent standard errors, p-values determined with an unpaired two-sided t-test. *** p &lt; 0.001, NS p &gt; 0.1 interaction was removed (AIC: 3,573.9). We found significant negative effects of time-out To test whether the nature of responding changed when stress and time-out status interacted, we regressed the submitted solution (Yes was coded as 1s) onto log cort ∆, IC, satisfiability, z-scored trial number, session number, time-out status, and a time-out status × log cort ∆ interaction (AIC: 3,868.3). We found a significant negative main effect of time-out status (β = −0.42, CI 95 = [−0.65, −0.21], p &lt; 0.001) and the time-out status × log cort ∆ interaction (β = −0.23, CI 95 = [−0.43, −0.03], p = 0.027), but no significant main effect of log cort ∆ (β = 0.07, CI 95 = [−0.03, 0.17], p = 0.175). These results indicate that, on trials that did not time-out, higher log cort ∆ was not significantly associated with the log-odds of submitting Yes as the solution. However, on trials that timed out, log cort ∆ was associated with a relative decrease in the log-odds of responding Yes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effect of higher cortisol levels on gaze and attention</head><p>There were significant differences in gaze tracking measures across the stress and control sessions <ref type="table">(Table S3</ref>). Specifically, in the stress condition participants attended to more items and had a shorter dwell time per visit. There was no significant difference in the amount of time spent visiting items or in the number of items visited per second (visit rate).</p><p>To determine whether stress was driving these changes in eye movements, we first correlated items attended to, dwell time per visit, and visit rate with log cort ∆. Next, we estimated a mixed-effects linear regression for each eye tracking measure, regressing it onto log cort ∆, IC, satisfiability, z-scored trial number, session number, and time on task. There was only a significant correlation between log cort ∆ and items attended to (r = 0.11, p &lt; 0.001). Next, we tested whether these differences in gaze tracking measures could explain accuracy. We estimated the best-fitting models from the main behavioural analysis a further three times, once each with either items attended to, visit rate, or dwell time as an additional regressor.</p><p>Additionally, we included an interaction term between satisfiability and each of the gaze tracking measures. This is because the pattern of search may differ when participants are searching for a combination of items that does meet the constraints (called a witness), which exists only in satisfiable trials, as opposed to having to verify that no such witness exists, which is the case for unsatisfiable trials. Following our exploratory result that acute stress and time-out status interacted to affect decision quality, we ran a further post-hoc analysis testing for such an interaction effect on gaze and attention. Specifically, we tested whether our three gaze tracking measures remained significantly different between stress and control sessions among timed out trials, and whether they influenced the solutions submitted. We observed that the gaze tracking measures only significantly differed between conditions among timed out trials <ref type="table">(Table S4</ref>). In particular, under stress, participants spent less time visiting items, attended to more items, dwelled on items for less time per visit, and switched between items more frequently ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 5C and D)</ref>.</p><p>To verify whether these gaze tracking measures influenced the solutions submitted, we re-estimated the earlier mixed-effects logistic regressions for solution submitted. For each regression, we added two additional regressors: the gaze tracking measure of interest and a three-way interaction between the gaze tracking measure, time-out status, and log cort ∆. 0.001, AIC = 2, 732.4). In both cases there were no qualitative changes among the other fixed effects. This suggests that the probability of submitting Yes as the solution was positively associated with attending to fewer items, dwelling on an item for longer, and visiting fewer items per second.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other exploratory analyses</head><p>We additionally conducted three post-hoc analyses. Firstly, whether there was a differential effect of higher cortisol levels on performance for participants that did well on the task versus those that did relatively poorly. Secondly, whether a trial-level estimate of cortisol levels is predictive of decision time and quality. Thirdly, whether perceived difficulty influenced decision time and quality.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We used a controlled laboratory experiment to investigate the effect of acute stress on decisionmaking in the knapsack decision task, an objective task which models many every-day complex decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Murawski &amp; Bossaerts, 2016)</ref>. Further, we measured within-task complexity as instance complexity, a measure of computational hardness inspired by computational complexity theory and capable of precisely characterising the hardness of individual decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Franco et al., 2021)</ref>. Our design allowed us to modulate both the computational resource requirements of the decision environment, via instance complexity, and decision-makers' stress levels, via the TSST. We expected acute stress to have a detrimental effect on decision quality, and particularly so at higher levels of computational hardness, that is, in situations in which the computational resource constraints are more binding.</p><p>We find that, in response to an acute psychosocial stressor, higher levels of cortisol impaired performance in the KDT, independent of the level of computational hardness.</p><p>While others have argued that acute stress has an increasingly impairing effect on performance as the complexity of a decision or cognitive task increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnsten, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Plieger &amp; Reuter, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Sandi, 2013)</ref>, these arguments have been limited in three ways. Firstly, prior studies tend to have a narrow focus on tasks which either isolate specific cognitive functions (e.g., executive functioning tasks) or can be difficult to disentangle from preferences (e.g., risk and uncertainty tasks). Secondly, these studies lack a formal framework with which to measure within-task complexity in a task-independent manner, making their complexity measures appear ad hoc. Thirdly, there is mixed evidence even among the tasks considered (G.-J. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lai, Yeh, Lin, Hsu, &amp; Wu, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Long &amp; Mo, 1971)</ref>. Having addressed those issues in our study, we offer the first evidence that higher cortisol impairs decision quality and changes attention allocation, even at low levels of computational hardness. Higher cortisol was also associated with an increased incidence of experienced time pressure, here defined as participants requiring the maximum time available to them in a trial, and post-hoc analyses showed the observed dif-ferences in decision quality and attention were driven by trials with experienced time pressure.</p><p>Decision-making research across different disciplines has increasingly used a framework of 'cognitive resources' to describe the cognitive demands on decision-makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref>. In these frameworks, constructs like energy, memory, and attention are cast as resources that are deployed in order to solve a problem or make a decision, with good decisions coming when the available cognitive resources meet or exceed those required by the task at hand. Along similar lines, the lens of a decision-maker engaging in information processing or computation has become widely adopted in cognitive science <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Piccinini &amp; Scarantino, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Richards &amp; Lillicrap, 2022)</ref>. To the extent that stress can be considered a tax on cognitive resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Vecchio, 1990)</ref>, our task provides an ideal way to investigate how reduced cognitive resources-by stress-affect decision-making at different levels of computational resource requirements.</p><p>Our ability to use precise, theory-driven, and widely generalisable metrics of complexity at the trial level left us uniquely placed to test for an interaction effect between acute stress and complexity on performance. To our surprise, we found no conclusive evidence for such an interaction. Put differently, the decrement in performance associated with higher cortisol levels was similarly distributed across trials with high and low computational resource requirements.</p><p>While we cannot rule out that a more precise measure of complexity would have captured an interaction effect, it would be surprising if our measure of instance complexity could near perfectly capture the expected effect of complexity, but not the dimension of complexity relevant to acute stress. What is more plausible is that stress affects a cognitive resource that is required independently of the computational resource requirements of an individual decision, e.g., cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Post-hoc exploratory analyses revealed a significant interaction between elevated cortisol, experienced time pressure, and satisfiability on performance. Under time pressure, higher levels of cortisol were associated with responding No more frequently. This more pessimistic pattern of responding is consistent with recent evidence that acute stress may lead to more pessimistic beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Molins, Paz, Rozman, Ben Hassen, &amp; Serrano, 2022)</ref>  To our knowledge, we are the first to show that higher levels of cortisol affects performance on a non-deterministic polynomial time complete (NP-complete) decision-making task.</p><p>For our purposes, NP-complete problems have four key features: they are ubiquitous, computationally hard at the problem level, their computational hardness varies considerably at the individual instance level, and NP-complete problems are mathematically related to each other, which suggests that findings in relation to one such problem are likely to generalise to all other NP-complete problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arora &amp; Barak, 2009)</ref>. Indeed, empirically, measures such as instance complexity have been found to predict human performance beyond the KDT, to a diverse set of NP-complete problems requiring skills as varied as spatial navigation or propositional logic to solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Franco et al., 2022)</ref>. Examples of real-world NP-complete settings include scheduling, budgeting, route planning, and event planning. Thus, the implications of understanding how stress affects such complex cognitive processes are vast, with potential applications including the improved design of work environments, educational programs, and therapeutic interventions.</p><p>We deployed gaze tracking analyses to investigate the potential cognitive mechanisms underpinning our results. We found that higher levels of cortisol were associated with differences in attention allocation: participants attended to more items, spent less time dwelling on each item, and switched between items more frequently. In particular, these differences were largely driven by trials where participants experienced time pressure. Contrary to work suggesting that the acute stress response can enhance attention, particularly selective attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Plieger et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Shields et al., 2016)</ref>, our data suggest a shallower attentional deployment under stress and time pressure. As the KDT requires the integration of two equally important attributes, weight and value, this may be consistent with divided attention being more vulnerable to the effects of elevated cortisol levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(LeBlanc, 2009)</ref>. It also implies that time pressure's purported effects of increased search across alternatives and less depth among alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Svenson &amp; Maule, 1993</ref>) is exacerbated by acute stress. Finally, these differences arose because the control condition changed its visual search pattern under time pressure, from a shallower search to a more focused one, whereas the stress condition's search remained shallow throughout. This suggests higher levels of cortisol may interfere with transitions in search strategy when under a deadline.</p><p>The gaze tracking analysis could also predict behaviour in the KDT. Specifically, we find that, attending to more items, higher dwell times, and lower visit rates were associated with a higher likelihood of submitting Yes as a solution. Further, we find clear differences in how search affects performance across different levels of satisfiability. For satisfiable trials, where participants are searching for a witness, attending to fewer items, dwelling on items for longer, and switching between items less frequently were associated with higher accuracy. This is consistent with participants excelling when they could find a candidate witness quickly, and adopt a more targeted and focused search strategy. Conversely, on unsatisfiable trials, where participants are looking to prove that no witness exists, higher accuracy was associated with the inverse: attending to more items, dwelling on items for less time, and switching between items more frequently. This is consistent with a shallower and broader search strategy as participants try to rule out different combinations of items.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with a pharmacological study that administered methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine to healthy participants solving the optimisation variant of the knapsack problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bowman, Coghill, Murawski, &amp; Bossaerts, 2023)</ref>. Both methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine are primarily dopamine agonists, but like acute stress, they also increase cortisol and noradrenaline levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Brown, Corriveau, &amp; Ebert, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Halbreich, Sachar, Asnis, Nathan, &amp; Halpern, 1981)</ref>. The study found that participants took more time to solve instances of the task, showed lower performance, and more scattered search under drug <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bowman et al., 2023)</ref>, consistent with our findings and neurobiological evidence that excess noradrenaline leads to less systematic search <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Rojas-Thomas et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Tervo et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Data recording issues with the skin conductance and eye tracking data limited our effective sample sizes for those analyses. While cortisol levels were correlated in the expected direction with our other stress measures, many of these did not reach statistical significance. While this is not uncommon in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Losiak &amp; Losiak-Pilch, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Piazza, Charles, Stawski, &amp; Almeida, 2013)</ref>, it limits our interpretation of the results largely to changes in behaviour related to an increase in cortisol levels, rather than the acute stress response more broadly. Similarly, while our behavioural data are consistent with more diverse samples that have solved the KDT <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Murawski &amp; Bossaerts, 2016)</ref>, we cannot be sure that our stress-related results generalise beyond our primarily university student sample.</p><p>Future work could test the generality of our findings with extensions employing a betweensubjects design, more refined computational complexity measures, a more diverse participant pool, and other computationally hard tasks, such as the travelling salesperson problem. More broadly, the framework employed here could be applied to other settings which may affect the cognitive resources available to a decision-maker, such as chronic stress, mental illness, and ageing. Our exploratory finding that under the combined effects of elevated cortisol levels and time pressure participants exhibit a more pessimistic pattern of responding, and that performance is most impaired in this setting, should be directly tested in a future confirmatory study.</p><p>In conclusion, our study looked at the intersection of two crucial areas of decision-making research. Firstly, acute stress is highly prevalent in our everyday lives and significantly affects performance on a variety of decision-making tasks. However, the direction and size of these effects depends upon numerous moderating factors. Secondly, many decisions we make, including important decisions, are computationally hard and often have severe impacts on our well-being in areas such as finance and health. It is thus critical to understand how acute stress affects decision-making, not only in easy cognitive tasks, but also in computationally hard decisions. Our study addressed these gaps, providing empirical evidence that higher cortisol levels impaired decision performance in the knapsack decision task, but that there was no interaction effect between acute stress and within-task complexity. An exploratory result showed that decision quality was most impaired when stress was accompanied by time pressure, with the magnitude of this effect warranting further study. Finally, our gaze tracking analysis tentatively suggests that differences in attention may be one possible mechanism for this effect, as attention appeared more scattered when jointly under stress and time pressure. While there is much work to be done to understand the generality of this result and the cognitive processes underpinning it, our study provides a first step towards a better understanding of how stress affects decision-making at varying levels of complexity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 42 participants (21 female, 21 male, 0 intersex, mean age 21.5 with SD = 3.6), predominantly university students, for an in-person laboratory experiment. Of the female participants, 16 were in the luteal phase, 3 in the follicular phase, and 2 in the menstrual phase of their menstrual cycle. Both sessions took place in the same menstrual phase for all. To avoid anticipatory stress responses the study was described as assessing "physiological and emotional responses to performance and decision-making tasks" <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Wemm &amp; Wulfert, 2017)</ref>. Each participant satisfied the following standard inclusion criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Shields et al., 2016)</ref>: aged 18-35 years, a Body Mass Index of between 19 and 26, not diagnosed with a (acute or chronic) disease (psychiatric or somatic), not currently going through a period of stress, not on any medication, not in psychotherapy treatment, not taking oral contraceptives or with an irregular menstrual cycle, not pregnant, no history of substance abuse, not working night shifts, not to have slept in the two hours prior to a session, and not to have exercised, eaten, smoked, brushed their teeth, or drunk anything other than water within one hour of a session starting 3 . Participants were paid a A$10 show-up fee for each session and A$0.7 for each correct response in the KDT. The average total payment was A$98.8 per participant. The experimental protocol was approved by the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee (Ethics ID 23412).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials Physiological and psychological measurements</head><p>We collected data on several stress measures, namely five salivary cortisol samples (HPA axis response), five samples of the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; subjective response) <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Watson, Anna, &amp; Tellegen, 1988)</ref>, and SCL sampled at 64 Hz (SAM response).</p><p>Additionally, every 9 trials, the participants rated how they were feeling on a scale of 0 (relaxed) to 5 (stressed), which we denote perceived stress (subjective response). Saliva samples were stored at -20C until analysis and SCL data were recorded using a Shimmer3 GSR+ and electrodes strapped around the base of the digit and middle fingers of their non-dominant hand.</p><p>Eye-tracking data were collected using a TobiiPro eye tracker with a sampling rate of 300 Hz, and Tobii Pro Lab software version 1.116.1. There were no head restrictions, participants were seated 60 cm from the screen, and the eye tracker was calibrated using a 9-point calibration. Eye positions were recorded for both eyes, and both horizontal and vertical gaze position were recorded where (0,0) was the top left corner of the screen and (1,1) was the bottom right corner. The task was done in a room with luminosity set to 40% and no natural light, at a 23.5-inch monitor at 1920x1080 resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental task: the 0-1 Knapsack Decision Task</head><p>The knapsack decision task is based on the decision variant of the 0-1 knapsack problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kellerer et al., 2004)</ref>. An instance of this problem consists of a set of items I = 1, . . . , N with weights w 1 , . . . , w N and values v 1 , . . . , v N , and two positive numbers c and p denoting the capacity and target profit (of the knapsack). The problem is to decide, yes or no, whether there exists a set S ⊆ I (a witness) such that i∈S w i ≤ c and i∈S v i ≥ p (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> for more details).</p><p>An instance for which a witness exists (does not exist) is called "satisfiable" ("unsatisfiable").</p><p>All weights, values, capacities, and target profits used were integers.</p><p>In each session, participants completed 72 unique trials of the knapsack decision task <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. Trials were self-paced, with participants having up to 40 seconds, determined with pilot testing, to proceed to the response screen. The response screen required them to select either Yes or No as their answer, with a maximum time limit of 3 seconds. The order of instances, the locations of items in an instance, and the sides of the Yes/No buttons on the response screen were randomised for each participant.</p><p>Each trial had two measures of performance: accuracy and time on task, operationalised as the proportion of the maximum available time used. Following each answer, participants rated the trial's difficulty on a discrete scale from (very easy) to 5 (very hard). Following every ninth trial participants rated their perceived stress on a discrete scale from (Relaxed) to 5 (Stressed). There were no time limits on these ratings. Once a trial was completed, participants were shown a fixation cross for 10-13 seconds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Instance sampling</head><p>Instances of the KDT were sampled based on their instance complexity, as defined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Franco et al. (2021)</ref>. Intuitively, IC measures the amount of computational resources an effective algorithm requires to solve an instance, where harder instances require more computational resources to solve. Formally, IC is the normalised distance between the target profit, p, and the maximum attainable profit, p * :</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">IC = p − p * v i<label>(1)</label></formula><p>IC was used to measure computational hardness for three reasons. Firstly, IC is highly correlated with typical case complexity (TCC), a theoretically-grounded, task-independent measure of computational hardness <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cheeseman, Kanefsky, &amp; Taylor, 1991)</ref>, which has been shown to theoretically <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Yadav et al., 2020)</ref> and empirically affect behaviour in the KDT and other computationally hard problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Franco et al., 2022)</ref>. Secondly, IC is a more precise measure for the computational hardness of an individual instance. Whereas TCC is defined on average in relation to a random ensemble of instances, IC is defined precisely for an individual instance <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Franco et al., 2021)</ref>. Thirdly, IC predicts performance equally well on satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances.</p><p>The value of IC is inversely proportional to the difficulty of the instance, and we randomly sampled 36 hard instances, IC ∈ [|0.0268|, |0.0321|], and 36 easy instances, IC ∈ [|0.0971|, |0.105|]. These parameters were chosen following pilot testing to target an average accuracy of 90% for easy instances and 70% for hard instances. For both easy and hard instances, half of the instances were satisfiable (unsatisfiable). Within the randomised order of instances, we divided the 72 instances into 6 blocks of 12, where each block had exactly 3 instances from each possible combination of hardness and satisfiability. This ensured that participants were exposed to a range of instances throughout the entire task. The task was programmed in Unity3d</p><p>(version 2020.3.28f1) and administered on a desktop computer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants completed a stress and a control session on separate days, on average 4 days apart, but at the same time of day. Sessions began either at 1pm or 4pm as natural cortisol levels are relatively stable in the afternoon <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allen, Kennedy, Cryan, Dinan, &amp; Clarke, 2014)</ref>. The location, experimenter, equipment, procedure, and tasks were identical across sessions, except for the stress manipulation. In the stress session, participants underwent the TSST <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kirschbaum, Pirke, &amp; Hellhammer, 1993)</ref>, which has been shown to be a highly effective and reliable way to induce acute stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bali &amp; Jaggi, 2015)</ref>. In the control session, participants underwent the placebo TSST <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Het et al., 2009)</ref>. Session order was counterbalanced across participants and sex.</p><p>The timeline of a typical session is detailed in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Firstly, participants gave informed consent and read through an outline of the experiment. Secondly, they were introduced to the physiological measurements. This included a video explaining the saliva sampling procedure, eye tracker calibration, and being fitted with SCL sensors. Thirdly, participants went through instructions for the KDT, followed by eight practice trials. Fourthly, they completed a 15-minute standing rest period to establish baseline SCL measurements. To improve salivary cortisol data reliability, participants were administered with 30g of dextrose powder dissolved in 200ml of water immediately prior to the rest period <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Labuschagne, Grace, Rendell, Terrett, &amp; Heinrichs, 2019)</ref>. Once consumed, participants were administered with 100ml of plain water. Fifthly, they went through the 15 minute TSST or placebo intervention. Finally, they solved 72 instances of the KDT, which took approximately 60 minutes. After the second session, participants were debriefed by the experimenter, including a pre-recorded video where the confederates in their stress session explained the purpose of the TSST.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stress manipulation</head><p>The TSST procedure was primarily adapted from the canonical version <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kudielka, Wüst, Kirschbaum, &amp; Hellhammer, 2007)</ref>, as well as from a recent guide <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Labuschagne et al., 2019)</ref>. The anticipatory, speech, and arithmetic phases each lasted 5 minutes. The speech topic was "imagine you are applying for your dream job, persuade the hiring panel to hire you". The arithmetic task involved counting down from 2047 in steps of 17. The speech topic for the placebo TSST was "What are your hobbies?" and the arithmetic task involved counting from 0 in steps of 15.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Salivary cortisol</head><p>Salivary cortisol was analysed by Royal Melbourne Hospital Pathology using a Roche Cobas instrument and the Cobas e411 analyser <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chiu, Collier, Clark, &amp; Wynn-Edwards, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vogeser et al., 2017)</ref>. Participants were excluded from analysis if their baseline salivary cortisol levels were more than 3 standard deviations from the mean <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Sandner, Zeier, Lois, &amp; Wessa, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Participants were classed as cortisol responders if their cortisol level exceeded baseline by at least 1.5 nmol/L <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Miller, Plessow, Kirschbaum, &amp; Stalder, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vogeser et al., 2017)</ref>, and both their peak and average cortisol levels were higher in the stress session than the control session.</p><p>As the distribution of cortisol values was highly skewed a natural logarithm transformation was applied.</p><p>Our primary stress measure was:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">log cort ∆ = ln(cort 3 ) + ln(cort 4 ) + ln(cort 5 ) 3 − ln(cort 1 ) + ln(cort 2 ) 2 .<label>(2)</label></formula><p>This measure has been used in several other stress and decision-making studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Lighthall et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Otto et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Lenow et al., 2017)</ref>. We used both baseline samples to compute the average baseline cortisol level for three reasons: firstly, to be consistent with the fact that post-intervention samples are averaged; secondly, to help reduce measurement error; thirdly, to account both for participants who arrived with abnormally high cortisol levels (t=1) and those who may have become stressed from aspects of the experiment which preceded the stress intervention (t=2).</p><p>An exploratory cortisol measure, log predicted cortisol, was constructed to approximate the cortisol level on a given trial. To compute this, we used cortisol samples 2-5 and regressed cortisol onto time using a LOESS regression. The predicted cortisol level at the time a trial began was stored. As LOESS regressions cannot extrapolate, for trials after the final cortisol sample we estimated a linear trend based on the last 3 LOESS predictions. We then applied a natural logarithm transformation and z-scored the variable for analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Skin conductance</head><p>An 8-minute window from both the rest period and the stress intervention was used to compute SCL. The windows were identical for each participant, namely from T − 10 to T − 2 minutes,</p><p>where T is the end of the period. Analysis was based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Taylor et al. (2015)</ref> and the code they made available on GitHub. The raw signal was passed through a 1Hz, fifth order, low-pass Butterworth filter. The median SCL for the rest period was treated as a baseline and subtracted from each point in the intervention period. The median of the baseline-adjusted intervention level was then z-scored and used as a session-level variable. The choice of mean or median, and whether to use the filtered signal, a square-root transform, a log transform, or a linear detrend had no influence on the results. Upon visual inspection of the data, 12 participants' SCL data needed to be discarded due to recording quality problems. This left 30 participants for analysis, of whom 22 were cortisol responders.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective measures</head><p>NA scores were computed from PANAS responses and square root transformed to reduce skewness. Contrary to the cortisol measures, the square root transformation led to a more approximately normal distribution than the log transformation. NA average change from baseline was computed and z-scored.</p><p>Perceived stress and perceived difficulty were both z-scored within participants to help control for individual heterogeneity in scale usage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Eye tracking</head><p>Gaze position data were down-sampled to 60Hz. Each sample was then allocated to the nearest area of interest (AOI), either one of the eight items or the constraints of the knapsack. Samples automatically flagged invalid, for example due to blinks, were removed. Trials with data loss of at least 30% were discarded from further eye tracking analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hooge, Niehorster, Nyström, Andersson, &amp; Hessels, 2022)</ref>. Samples were classified as a visit or a saccade based on the I-VT velocity algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Salvucci &amp; Goldberg, 2000)</ref> used by Tobii Pro Lab, and here implemented using the CatEyes Python package (version 0.0.3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gütlin, 2021)</ref>. Saccades with an amplitude less than 1 degree were deleted, followed by visits of less than 100ms <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hooge et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>Resulting visits were merged if they were less than 100ms apart <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hooge et al., 2022)</ref>. Precision was computed as the sample-to-sample root mean squared distance of the gaze data, averaged across participants. Precision was 0.20 and did not differ between conditions.</p><p>Following these standard methods, we applied two additional pre-processing steps. Firstly, we removed trials where the cumulative time spent visiting AOIs was less than 10 seconds and less than 60% of the time on task. This was done to ensure that participants were engaging with the task. Second, we removed participants that did not have a similar number of trials across easy vs hard, satisfiable vs unsatisfiable, and stress vs control instances. Similarity was defined as having at least 6 surviving trials in each group and the smaller group having at least 70% the number of surviving trials as the larger group. This left 3,910 trials (66%) of trials across 30 participants for eye tracking analysis, of whom 21 were cortisol responders.</p><p>To compute the average pupil diameter for a trial we took the median pupil diameter of the preceding inter-trial-interval to avoid the confounding effects of the task on pupil diameter.</p><p>We computed two pupil measures: the average pupil diameter across all trials and across only the first 12 trials. We expect the effect of the stress intervention on pupil diameter to be most pronounced at the beginning of the task and to return to baseline quite quickly. We used the first 12 trials as our cut-off for the beginning as this is the earliest time point at which each participant would have completed an equal number of trials for every possible combination of easy, hard, satisfiable, and unsatisfiable instances.</p><p>Four main gaze tracking measures were analysed: the proportion of time spent visiting items, the number of items visited, the mean dwell time per visit, and visit rate. We computed these measures at the inter-trial level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Main analysis</head><p>To account for individual differences in cortisol levels and task performance, we used hierarchical modelling with random effects on the intercept for each participant. We used three classes of regression models. Linear, logistic, and one-inflated beta regressions were used to predict unbounded continuous variables, binary variables, and bounded continuous variables, respectively. For the beta regressions, two participants were excluded as they took the maximum available time on more than 99% of trials. If multiple models were considered, the AIC was used for model selection. The main focus of the analysis was cortisol responders, but the full sample (excluding cortisol outliers) is reported in the Supplementary Information for completeness. The independent variable used to assess stress was log cort ∆.</p><p>To verify the robustness of our results, we repeated our main analysis for accuracy and time on task by replacing log cort ∆, with an aggregate measure of stress (aggregate stress).</p><p>Aggregate stress was computed as the simple average of the z-scores of log cort ∆, SCL, and NA. A participant was classified as stressed if their aggregate stress was greater in the stress session than the control session.</p><p>After removing one cortisol outlier, we had 41 participants, of which 27 were classed as cortisol responders and 29 were classed as stressed by our aggregate measure. Comparing the aggregate stress group and cortisol responders, 20 participants were in both groups.

Lai &amp; Gershman, 2024), such as always responding No when a witness has not been found. As Fig. 5 makes clear, benchmarked against performance without time pressure, relative to the control session, this pessimistic behaviour led to a 7 percentage point increase in accuracy on unsatisfiable trials and an 18 percentage point decline in accuracy on satisfiable trials. In absolute terms, accuracy fell by 25 percentage points on satisfiable trials, reducing performance to near-chance levels. It was performance on these trials that overwhelmingly drove the aggregate reduction in performance under acute stress. This result suggests that people may be vulnerable to forgoing beneficial op-portunities, the analogue of a satisfiable trial, under the joint effect of elevated cortisol and time pressure. This could have implications for policymakers and choice architects alike in settings where acute stress and time pressure coincide, such as in financial or medical emergencies.</figDesc></figure>
