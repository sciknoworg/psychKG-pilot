				<p>At the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, our interdisciplinary team hypothesized that a mathematical misconception-whole number bias (WNB)-contributed to incorrect beliefs that COVID-19 was less fatal than the flu. We created a novel, five-minute online educational intervention, leveraging evidence-based cognitive science research, to encourage accurate COVID-19 and flu fatality rate calculations and comparisons. As predicted, adults (N = 1,297) randomly assigned to the intervention were more likely to correctly answer health decision-making problems and were less likely to report WNB errors in their problem-solving strategies relative to control participants. There were no immediate effects of condition on COVID-19 risk perceptions and worry; however, those in the intervention group did exhibit increased perceived risk and worry across 10 days of daily diaries. The intervention did not cause distress; instead, it increased positive affect. Ameliorating WNB errors could impact people&apos;s risk perceptions about future health crises.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview and Significance</head><p>In early 2020, COVID-19 became a global pandemic. The WHO (2020) deemed the outbreak an "infodemic" because of an overabundance of misinformation. Misinformation has likely reduced engagement in adaptive health behaviors across the globe. Interpreting the magnitude of COVID-19 risk--a key predictor of health behavior--requires understanding information presented as rational numbers: fractions, whole number frequencies, and percentages.</p><p>However, this numerical information is often presented as the total number of deaths across two viruses sans the numbers of confirmed cases, which may lead people to underestimate  risk. For example, one popular press article <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Netburn, 2020)</ref> was titled, The flu has killed far more people than coronavirus. So why all the frenzy about  In the current study, we tested whether an online educational intervention aimed at reducing a mathematical misconception known as whole number bias (WNB) could improve adults' reasoning about COVID-19 risk. WNB occurs when people incorrectly use whole number knowledge to reason about rational numbers <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Ni &amp; Zhou, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Opfer &amp; DeVries, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Thompson &amp; Opfer, 2008)</ref>; for example, thinking about numerators or denominators as whole numbers in isolation rather than parts of a ratio. Reducing WNB errors about COVID-19 risk is critical because accurately interpreting the magnitude, or size, of COVID-19 risk could be one key component to slowing the spread of the virus.</p><p>Statistics on COVID-19 infections and deaths are updated minute-by-minute. Early in the pandemic, when COVID-19 deaths were low <ref type="table">(Table 1)</ref>, comparing the number of deaths or the number of people infected with each virus led many to the mistaken conclusion that COVID-19 was less fatal than the flu (a WNB error) (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Faust, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Faust &amp; Rio, 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Faust &amp; Rio, 2020b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Rettner, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Walker, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Yan, 2020)</ref>. However, fatality rates are only comparable when deaths are considered relative to the total number infected (fatalityflu_rate=.06%; fatalityCOVID_rate=4.1%). Thus, without these relative comparisons WNB could result in underestimation of risk. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>. COVID-19 and flu statistics as of mid-March 2020 when data were collected</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of deaths Total number of people infected</head><p>Reasoning about the magnitude of ratios compared to whole numbers is more effortful, error-prone, and time-consuming (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Fazio et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Siegler et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Yu et al., in press</ref>).</p><p>According to dual-processing theories, people must first inhibit automatic, over-practiced wholenumber processes before engaging strategic rational number processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Vamvakoussi, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Vamvakoussi &amp; Vosniadou, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Vosniadou, 2014)</ref>. Hence, WNB errors occur when wholenumber processing is not inhibited. With regards to COVID-19, WNB errors result from automatically processing the absolute number of deaths or infections in isolation, rather than strategically processing their relative magnitudes to comprehend fatality rates.</p><p>Furthermore, anxiety and negative attitudes associated with COVID-19 could compound WNB by leading people to avoid thinking deeply about numbers. All types of numbers can elicit math anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ashcraft, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Ashcraft &amp; Krause, 2007)</ref>, or apprehension about mathematics <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Beilock et al., 2010)</ref>, and most people report disliking rational numbers more than whole numbers .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Educational Interventions Combat Rational Number Misconceptions</head><p>Several evidence-based interventions have improved children's rational number understanding. For example, worked examples providing step-by-step instructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Renkl, 2014)</ref> improve rational number and algebraic outcomes in real classrooms <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Star et al., 2016)</ref>. Breaking non-unit fractions into combinations of unit fractions (e.g., decomposing 2/3 into 1/3+1/3; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Braithwaite &amp; Siegler, 2020)</ref> improves fraction understanding. Feedback that helps children use landmarks on a number line <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Fazio et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Rittle-Johnson et al., 2001</ref>) improves estimation precision. Finally, number lines facilitate accurate reasoning about fraction division <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Sidney, Thompson, &amp; Rivera, 2019)</ref>, and visual models improve learning about density, which is integrally tied to ratio concepts <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Schwartz et al., 2011)</ref>. Although these interventions have improved children's rational number understanding, they have not been implemented with adults. Thus, we combined aspects of these interventions to improve adults' understanding of COVID-19 risk.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk Perceptions Involve Magnitude Judgments</head><p>Health decision making is impaired when people make mathematical errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Lipkus &amp; Peters, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Nelson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Peters, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Reyna &amp; Brainerd, 2008)</ref>. Specifically, WNB errors can impede accurately judging one's disease risk or appropriately calibrating disease worry. Risk perceptions--thoughts or feelings about the likelihood of developing a disease, and worry <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Chapman et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Portnoy et al., 2014)</ref>--affective concern about developing a disease--are related yet distinct constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ferrer et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Taber et al., 2020)</ref> that directly influence health behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Brewer et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Hay et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Sheeran, Harris, &amp; Epton, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Risk perceptions and worry involve magnitude judgments, as people consider how big or small their chances of an outcome are. Research on WNB can inform how people judge their risk.</p><p>Specifically, even if disease rates are equivalent in magnitude, people could be swayed by the size of the whole number components. For example, although ½ and 15/30 are equivalent in magnitude (50%), people overestimate 15/30 on number lines leading to lower precision when estimating 15/30 compared to 1/2 <ref type="bibr">(Braithwaite &amp; Siegler, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fitzsimmons et al., in press)</ref>. With regards to the early COVID-19 death counts, considering the low number of COVID-19 deaths versus the high number of flu deaths may have caused people to underestimate COVID-19 risk. Thus, we expected that an intervention targeting accurate magnitude understanding could influence individuals' risk perceptions and worry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Study</head><p>We tested whether a novel online educational intervention could reduce adults' tendencies to make WNB errors pertaining to COVID-19 risk, subsequently improving health decision making and increasing risk perceptions over 10 days. The intervention invited calculation of holistic fraction magnitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Siegler, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Siegler et al., 2011)</ref> instead of considering numerators or denominators in isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Opfer &amp; DeVries, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Thompson &amp; Opfer, 2008)</ref>. This brief fiveminute intervention involved evidence-based techniques from laboratory settings to improve rational number understanding (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Fazio et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fitzsimmons et al., in preparation;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Fuchs et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Schwartz et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Data were collected from March 24-April 9, 2020 from over 1,200 adults across the U.S.</p><p>The sample was stratified by age, gender, and educational attainment. During data collection, "stay at home" orders due to COVID-19 were beginning across the U.S. The CDC and WHO urged people to treat COVID-19 as a major public health risk. Concurrently, COVID-19 was being compared to the flu in the media, likely inviting WNB errors <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Thompson et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Our primary aim was to investigate whether an educational intervention could decrease WNB errors to promote accurate interpretation of COVID-19 health statistics. We hypothesized that (1) WNB errors would be common prior to the intervention, and (2) participants experiencing the intervention, relative to control, would accurately answer post-intervention health decisionmaking problems and commit fewer WNB errors in their reported strategies.</p><p>Our secondary aim was to assess the effect of the intervention on risk perceptions, worry, affect, and health behavior. We hypothesized that intervention relative to control participants would report greater perceived risk and worry regarding COVID-19 and explored whether the intervention influenced positive or negative emotional experiences and engagement in recommended health behaviors (e.g., social distancing, mask wearing, etc.) across a 10-day followup.</p><p>Individual differences might also predict performance on COVID-19 health decisionmaking problems (cf. <ref type="bibr">Thompson et al., invited revision)</ref>. We used number line estimation precision as a proxy for math skills because performance on this measure is strongly related to overall math achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Siegler et al., 2011)</ref>. We also measured math anxiety because people who struggle with rational number magnitudes exhibit higher math anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Sidney, Thalluri, et al., 2019)</ref> and score lower on objective measures of numeracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Choi et al., 2020)</ref>, skills crucial to interpreting health risks. We included gender as a covariate because women show lower estimation precision <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Hutchison et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rivers et al., under review;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Thompson &amp; Opfer, 2008)</ref>, and higher levels of math anxiety and negative attitudes about rational numbers than men .</p><p>Our team consisted of experts in cognitive science, development, math cognition, health and risk perceptions, and affective science. To our knowledge, no other math interventions have taken a daily diary approach to track the longevity of intervention effects. Therefore, we could answer theoretically motivated basic science questions with practical implications for the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is an ecologically valid test case for our theoretical questions, and the intervention should be applicable to other health contexts involving misinterpretation of numeric risks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline and Sociodemographic Differences Across Conditions</head><p>We assessed differences across conditions to confirm successful random assignment. There were no condition differences in age, education, employment status, number of math courses taken, race/ethnicity, number line estimation PAE, math anxiety, math attitudes, subjective numeracy, objective numeracy, need for cognition, health literacy, or baseline negative or positive affect (all ps&gt;.09). There were more males randomly assigned to control (52.8%) than to the intervention (47.2%), χ 2 (1)=4.47, p=.034. As per our pre-registration analysis plan, we included gender as a covariate in subsequent analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WNB at Baseline</head><p>Baseline health decision-making accuracy was low overall. Only 43.10% of participants correctly indicated that Disease A was more fatal than Disease B. Another 43.72% committed WNB by incorrectly selecting the disease with a smaller ratio but larger whole number components. This was a higher rate than random guessing (33.33% for three possible responses; χ 2 (1)=56.89, p&lt;.001). Only 13.18% of participants incorrectly responded that the diseases were equally fatal.</p><p>Consistent with our hypotheses, many participants mentioned WNB errors in their strategy reports (see Appendix F). At baseline, controlling for gender, participants were equally likely to mention WNB errors in their strategy reports across conditions, b=0. <ref type="bibr">03,</ref><ref type="bibr">p=.805,</ref><ref type="bibr">OR=1.03,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [0.81,</ref><ref type="bibr">1.32]</ref>. Notably, those who responded incorrectly were far more likely to report a WNB error in their baseline strategy reports than those who answered correctly (47.6% vs. 2.5%), χ 2 (1)=317.09, p&lt;.001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immediate Effect of the Intervention on Health Decision-Making Accuracy</head><p>We conducted logistic regressions, controlling for gender, to examine the effect of the educational intervention on health decision-making accuracy. As hypothesized, participants in the intervention condition were more likely than those in the control to correctly answer that COVID-19 is more fatal than the flu (b=1. <ref type="bibr">31,</ref><ref type="bibr">p&lt;.001,</ref><ref type="bibr">OR=3.71,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [2.85,</ref><ref type="bibr">4.85]</ref>). Observed frequencies indicated that more individuals answered correctly in the intervention (42.41%) compared to the control condition (29.68%). One of the two possible incorrect responses was consistent with WNB.</p><p>Of the 27.91% who were incorrect across conditions, 67.13% of those individuals chose the response consistent with WNB (flu was more fatal than COVID-19) compared to the incorrect response that did not involve WNB (they were equally fatal; 32.87%), χ 2 (1)=42.48, p&lt;.001. Thus, WNB led to incorrect responses. Males were more likely than females to respond correctly (observed frequencies of those who answered correctly: MM=77. <ref type="bibr">4%,</ref><ref type="bibr">MF=67.6%),</ref><ref type="bibr">b=0.62,</ref><ref type="bibr">p&lt;.001,</ref><ref type="bibr">OR=1.85,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [1.43,</ref><ref type="bibr">2.41]</ref>. Even after controlling for additional covariates typically associated with accuracy on math tasks (Appendix <ref type="table" target="#tab_7">Table A1</ref>), participants in the intervention condition were more likely to answer correctly relative to control, b=1. <ref type="bibr">42,</ref><ref type="bibr">p&lt;.0001,</ref><ref type="bibr">OR=4.14,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [3.11,</ref><ref type="bibr">5.57]</ref>.</p><p>Next, we analyzed responses to the near and far transfer problems. Across conditions, more participants who incorrectly answered the two transfer problems selected the WNB response than the other incorrect response (near transfer: 77.66% vs. 22.34%, χ 2 (1)=293.22, p&lt;.001; far transfer; 73.27% vs. 26.73%, χ 2 (1)=112.62, p&lt;.001). Participants were more likely to correctly answer the near transfer problem in the intervention than in the control condition (Appendix <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table A2</ref>), when controlling for gender, b=0. <ref type="bibr">35,</ref><ref type="bibr">p=.007,</ref><ref type="bibr">OR=1.41,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [1.10,</ref><ref type="bibr">1.82]</ref>, or the larger set of <ref type="bibr">covariates,</ref><ref type="bibr">b=0.40,</ref><ref type="bibr">p=.006,</ref><ref type="bibr">OR=1.48,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [1.12,</ref><ref type="bibr">1.98]</ref>. Simple frequencies indicated that more individuals within the intervention condition answered correctly (29.01%) compared to the control (23.21%). Contrary to hypotheses, there were no condition differences on the far transfer problem when controlling for gender, <ref type="bibr">p=.747,</ref><ref type="bibr">OR=0.96,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [0.77,</ref><ref type="bibr">1.21]</ref>, or the larger set of <ref type="bibr">covariates,</ref><ref type="bibr">p=.486,</ref><ref type="bibr">OR=0.91,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [0.71,</ref><ref type="bibr">1.18</ref>] (Appendix <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table A3</ref>).</p><p>We tested the interaction between magnitude knowledge (PAE) and condition because people may benefit more from the educational intervention if they began the experiment with lower mathematical skills, thus had more "room to grow." However, this interaction was not significant, did not improve model fit, and is not discussed further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>WNB in Strategy Reports</head><p>Across conditions, the proportion of people who reported WNB strategies was greater among those who answered the health decision-making problems incorrectly compared to correctly: immediate posttest, χ 2 (1)=187.78, p&lt;.001 (observed frequencies: 35.91% for incorrect vs. 5.99% for correct); near transfer, χ 2 (1)=96.55, p&lt;.001 (observed frequencies: 27.97% for incorrect vs. 2.36% for correct); far transfer, χ 2 (1)=63.74, p&lt;.001 (31.73% for incorrect vs. 13.26% for correct).</p><p>We conducted parallel logistic regressions predicting WNB strategy use on the posttest problems. As hypothesized, participants were less likely to report WNB errors at immediate posttest in the intervention than in the control condition (observed frequencies:</p><p>intervention=18.69% vs. control=10.08%), both when controlling for gender, <ref type="bibr">p&lt;.001,</ref><ref type="bibr">OR=0.48,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [0.34,</ref><ref type="bibr">0.66]</ref>, and the larger set of covariates, b=-0. <ref type="bibr">90,</ref><ref type="bibr">p&lt;.001,</ref><ref type="bibr">OR=0.41,</ref><ref type="bibr">95% CI [0.28,</ref><ref type="bibr">0.59]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Immediate Effect of the Intervention on Risk Perceptions, Worry, and Affect</head><p>Next, we examined the immediate effect of the intervention on participants' COVID-19 risk perceptions and worry, controlling for gender (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">Appendix Tables A7 and A8)</ref> Next, we examined the long-term effects of the intervention on participants' COVID-19 risk perceptions, worry, positive and negative affect, and reports of recommended health behaviors in daily diaries completed in the 10 days following the intervention.</p><p>Risk perceptions and worry. Initial analyses examined the effect of condition on risk perceptions (Appendix <ref type="table">Table B1</ref>) and worry (Appendix <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table B2</ref>) over time, with day as a fixed factor at Level 1 and condition and gender as fixed factors at Level 2. Participants in the intervention relative to the control condition reported increases in risk perceptions, B=0.24, SE=0.18, p=0.173 and worry across 10 days, B=0.23, SE=0.14, p=.093, though these effects did not reach statistical significance. Males had significantly higher worry than females, B=0.28, SE=0.14, p=0.041. Notably, risk perceptions increased with each increasing day, B=0.05, SE=0.01, p&lt;.001. Worry, however, did not increase over 10 days, B=0.001, SE=0.006, p=.876. Separate plots of risk perceptions and worry by condition indicated non-linear change of perceived risk and worry across 10 days, thus in follow-up analyses, we examined the initial (days 1-3), middle (days 4-6) and final (days 7-10) periods of the diary assessment. Individuals in the intervention relative to the control condition reported greater perceived risk during the middle period, B=0.39, SE = 0.20, p=.051 (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). However, perceived risk in the initial period, <ref type="bibr">B=0.15,</ref><ref type="bibr">SE=0.19,</ref><ref type="bibr">p=.43</ref>, and final period, B=0.31, SE=0.21, p=.14, did not differ by condition.</p><p>For worry, individuals in the intervention relative to the control condition reported significantly greater worry in the initial period, B=0.43, SE=0.18, p=.017. Further, day moderated the effect of condition, such that worry increased across days within the initial period for participants in the intervention, but worry declined over the initial period for participants in the control condition, B=-0.10, SE=0.05, p=.053. After the initial period, individuals in the intervention relative to the control condition maintained greater worry, though the effect was not significant in the final period, B=0.25, SE=0.15, p=.09 (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Ratings of COVID-19 worry are greater for the intervention condition on days 1, 2, and 3 of longitudinal sampling relative to the control condition.</p><p>Positive and negative affect. We then examined the impact of the intervention on reported negative (Appendix <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table B3</ref>) and positive affect (Appendix <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table B4</ref>) over 10 days, with day at Level 1 and condition and gender at Level 2. Results suggested individuals in the intervention relative to the control condition reported higher, albeit non-significant, levels of positive affect across 10 days, B=0.095, SE=0.063, p=0.13. However, there was a negative association with time, as reports of positive affect decreased slightly with each increasing day for all participants, B=-0.02, SE=0.00, p&lt;.001. In addition, males reported greater positive affect than females, B=0.18, SE=0.06, p=0.006. In contrast, there was no impact of condition or gender on negative affect; although negative affect decreased with passing days for all participants, B=-0.01, SE=0.00, p=0.07.</p><p>Follow-up analyses examined positive affect across the initial, middle, and final periods of the diary assessment. The difference in positive affect across conditions was greatest in the initial period, B=0.12, SE=0.07, p=0.06, and dissipated over time (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3)</ref>. We did not further examine negative affect because it did not vary by condition. reported over 10 days. As expected, affect was significantly associated with behaviors, such that greater positive and negative state and trait affect predicted greater daily use of recommended behaviors (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">Appendix Table B5</ref>). There was no effect of condition on behaviors both when including affect in the model, B=0.15, SE=0.15, p=.34, and when gender and condition were the only predictors in the model, B=.20, SE=.17, p=.23. There was a relatively small but inverse association between time and behaviors: the probability of endorsing one recommended health behavior decreased by 6% with each additional day: B=-0.06, SE=0.01, p&lt;.001.</p><p>Robustness checks. Finally, we controlled for significant math predictors of health decision-making (i.e., PAE, baseline health decision-making accuracy, and math anxiety) along with demographic factors (i.e., gender, age, educational attainment, and race). Including this larger set of covariates did not change the effects of condition on daily diary outcomes (i.e., risk perceptions, worry, affect, or health behaviors) (see Appendix B). Model fit statistics for the daily diary analyses indicated only minor improvements with additional covariates (e.g., AIC/BIC/AICC decreased by 6-12), suggesting that benefits of considering these additional covariates in the daily diary models were negligible except when positive and negative affect were the dependent variables. In those cases, the addition of socio-demographic and math covariates did enhance model fit (e.g., AIC/BIC/AICC decreased by 50-90). Of note, math anxiety was a significant positive predictor of risk perceptions, worry, and negative affect immediately postintervention and across 10 days (refer to Appendix A and B).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This online experiment, with over 1,200 adult participants from a nationally representative U.S. sample, was conducted near the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, when misinformation was widespread <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Thompson et al., 2020)</ref>. Our educational intervention, designed to combat WNB errors, facilitated higher post-intervention health decision-making accuracy and transfer, relative to control. Aligned with prior research <ref type="bibr">(Thompson et al., invited revision)</ref>, health decision-making accuracy and strategy reports in the current study provided convergent evidence for WNB. The intervention led to fewer reported WNB errors even after controlling for gender, WNB errors at baseline, math anxiety, math skills, and age. For health decision-making questions in multiplechoice format (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Cuite et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">Waters et al., 2007)</ref>, people can guess correctly a substantial portion of the time (33.33% in the current study). Further, specific numerators and denominators chosen for health decision-making problems can impact prevalence of WNB <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bonato et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Fazio et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sidney, Thalluri, et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Schneider &amp; Siegler, 2010)</ref>. One advantage of collecting both accuracy and strategy reports for health decision-making problems is that this multi-pronged approach affords insight into why participants answered correctly or incorrectly, thus highlighting WNB errors.</p><p>We also identified individual differences that contributed to health decision-making outcomes. Math skills and gender predicted post-intervention health decision-making accuracy and transfer. Males were more likely than females to correctly answer the baseline health decisionmaking problem (OR=1.98, 95% CI [1.59,2.48]). Research suggests men produce more precise number line estimates than women <ref type="bibr">(Hutchins et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rivers et al., under review;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Thompson &amp; Opfer, 2008)</ref>, which may give men an advantage when considering numerical magnitudes in health decision-making contexts. Future research can determine whether these differences result from differences in spatial ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Newcombe et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rivers et al., under review)</ref> or formal/informal learning experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Halpern et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Levine et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pruden et al., 2011)</ref>. Also, adults with greater math anxiety were less accurate on the near transfer problem and reported greater risk perceptions, worry, and negative affect. Therefore, the role of math anxiety in health risk perceptions and worry should be further explored.</p><p>Our finding that 44% of adults showed WNB errors at baseline may underestimate WNB prevalence (though Waters et al., 2007 report a similar rate). After applying pre-registered exclusion criteria, 51% of participants who were incorrect vs. 37% of participants who were correct on the baseline health decision-making problem were excluded. Because the study was conducted online, we cannot determine whether excluded participants had low math skills, exhibited low effort, or were bots. Adults who might benefit most from the intervention may have dropped out or were considered poor responders.</p><p>Another novel contribution of this experiment is that it tested the impact of a mathematical intervention on risk perceptions and worry related to COVID-19, as well as affect and engagement in recommended health behaviors. Although condition did not predict COVID-19 risk perceptions or worry immediately post-intervention in the baseline session, intervention participants later reported increased risk perceptions and worry relative to control participants in the daily diaries.</p><p>Specifically, increases in COVID-19 worry during Days 1-3 were somewhat maintained over time, and COVID-19 risk perceptions increased for intervention participants beginning on Day 4 of diaries. Even though the intervention increased risk perceptions and worry, it increased positive affect over several days and did not cause distress. Exploratory analyses indicated the intervention did not increase adults' engagement in recommended health behaviors. However, behavior change was not the intervention target. Health behaviors are driven by numerous factors, including but not limited to, habits, emotion, socioeconomic status, health literacy, and health cognitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Glanz &amp; Bishop, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Michie et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Stokols, 1996)</ref>.</p><p>Although many factors contribute to health decision making, our findings underscore the necessity of robust rational number skills for understanding health statistics. Future work in health decision making should measure rational number estimation precision, not just whole number estimation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Peters &amp; Bjalkebring, 2015)</ref>, as a proxy for general math skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Fazio et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Siegler et al., 2011)</ref>. Given that the Berlin Numeracy measure is commonly used as a measure of math skills in the health decision-making literature, and it relies primarily on whole number knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Cokely et al., 2012)</ref>, we explored whether rational number estimation precision (PAE) improved model fit for correctly answering the health decision-making problems. Adding PAE to models with condition, gender, and numeracy improved model fit for all health problems (χ 2 (1)s&gt;56, ps&lt;.001), suggesting that rational number skills should be considered in future health decision-making research. Assessing number line estimation skills is fast <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Fazio et al., 2017)</ref>, and these tasks are easy to administer online (e.g., with Qualtrics sliders) or on paper. Our findings have theoretical implications for research on math cognition, health decisionmaking, and risk perceptions. The evidence-based math intervention included analogies, worked examples, preparatory activities, and number line visualizations to improve adults' health decision-making accuracy during an emerging health crisis. Drawing analogies between similar relationships in disparate contexts is "what makes us smart" as a species <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Gentner, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">2003)</ref>.</p><p>The current intervention effectively leveraged people's spontaneous tendency to engage with comparisons by fostering analogies between familiar (rotting apples in two different orchards) and unfamiliar (disease fatality rates) contexts, contributing to a growing literature on using analogies to understand health risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bostrom, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Galesic &amp; Garcia-Retamero, 2012)</ref>. However, the penchant for analogical reasoning may also lead humans to compare COVID-19 to other illnesses, like the flu, with inherent error. Growing COVID-19 death counts have fueled new analogies in the media (e.g., risks associated with skydiving, giving birth, and being a soldier during wartimes;</p><p>Roberts, 2020) that all may be impacted by WNB. Strikingly, knowledge from the intervention transferred to untrained problems. This is promising given that transfer is often elusive <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Barnett &amp; Ceci, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Kaminski et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Klahr &amp; Chen, 2011)</ref>. Far transfer could be attainable if the intervention was administered at a higher dosage distributed across time <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Dunlosky et al., 2013)</ref>. Future research should dismantle and identify the most effective ingredient of the intervention and determine the longevity of the intervention beyond 10 days. Assessing math intervention efficacy across extended periods is uncommon because maturational influences or other formal/informal educational experiences could impact post-intervention performance (though see Ramani <ref type="bibr">&amp; Siegler [2009]</ref>). Another open question is how adults' risk perceptions change across time as they process up-to-the-moment COVID-19 information.</p><p>In addition to reducing WNB, the intervention led to increases in perceived risk of COVID-19 during a 10-day diary assessment. This is meaningful because risk perceptions are difficult to change, especially when people underestimate their risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b115">(Weinstein &amp; Klein, 1995)</ref>. For example, increased risk perceptions are often not sustained among individuals who test positive for a genetic mutation conferring increased objective risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aspinwall et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Braithwaite et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Heshka et al., 2008)</ref>. Here, we attempted to increase perceived COVID-19 risk and worry, given misleading media reports that COVID-19 was less fatal than the flu. The educational intervention likely changed risk perceptions because they inherently involve an approximate assessment of magnitude (e.g., low vs. high risk), and the effects appeared to last for days. Notably, individuals' personalized COVID-19 risk was unknowable, so accuracy of perceived risks could not be assessed at this time. However, as more definitive information about COVID-19 risk factors are uncovered, alignment between perceived and objective risk can be determined. Perceived risks and worry for oneself and others were strongly correlated; relatively few prior studies have examined risk perceptions for close others (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ghassemi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Klein &amp; Ferrer, 2018)</ref>, despite calls for greater attention to interpersonal processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Rothman et al., 2020)</ref>. This is particularly relevant in a highly contagious pandemic context when one's health behaviors affect others (i.e., hand washing or vaccination).</p><p>Our findings have practical education and health implications. The intervention showed promise to address a major mathematical and health misconception with potentially fatal consequences: the flu is more fatal than COVID-19. It marks a step toward translational, benchto-bedside research <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Booth et al., 2017</ref>) by harnessing cognitive science to inform  health communication. This intervention could be widely disseminated to decrease WNB errors in other real-life contexts (e.g., converting salary to hourly pay, considering infection rates and side effect rates of drugs, etc.). Given the far-reaching effects of this brief intervention, which decreased WNB errors, it is imperative to refine additional interventions to mitigate other mathematical misconceptions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Furlong &amp; Opfer, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>In summary, our short educational intervention about COVID-19 case fatality rates diminished WNB errors--a prevalent mathematical misconception experienced by all people. This is the first study, to our knowledge, in which the detrimental impact of WNB errors was assessed during a real-world health pandemic. Our findings are robust because condition differences held even when we controlled for a range of demographic and math factors. This intervention has the potential to make a large, positive impact on health cognitions during the COVID-19 public health crisis. Health officials and the media often express risk information numerically, and novel health threats will continue to emerge. Thus, it is critical to examine how people engage with numeric information and experience WNB in other unexpected and unprecedented health contexts. Note: For the purpose of analyses, males were coded as 1, and participants who selected "female," "other," or chose not to answer were coded as 0. For ease of interpretation we refer to the latter group as "women" although we acknowledge this is an inaccurate category label.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>In our pre-registration (https://osf.io/fthm3/?view_only=dc93269c950945be8cf3b07ca9030a8b), we planned to sample 1,200 people and collect data from at least 625. This stopping rule was based on the availability of funds to collect the data through Qualtrics. Data were collected from March 24 to April 9, 2020 through Qualtrics panels. We sought to recruit equivalent numbers of males and females and to stratify by educational attainment to represent education levels in the U.S. population (although in the final sample, a smaller proportion of people (3.9%) had earned less than a high school diploma than in the overall U.S. population (12.3%, U.S. Census Quick Facts). Seventy-five percent of participants self-identified as White, 46% identified as male, 41% reported being employed for wages, and 70% reported having between some college experience and a graduate degree. See <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref> for demographics.</p><p>We embedded checks on attention and engagement during the baseline assessment and over the 10 days of daily diaries, per recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Behrend et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Hauser &amp; Schwarz, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Meyerson &amp; Tryon, 2003)</ref>. Data cleaning processes, detailed in the Appendix D, reduced the sample from an initial 2,693 adults who consented to 1,297 who provided adequate data and compliance. There were some differences between those included and those excluded from analysis: those excluded were younger and more likely to be white, female, students, or selfemployed. They were also less likely to be retired or employed for wages, report lower income, have taken fewer math courses, and be incorrect on the objective numeracy and baseline health decision-making question. The analytic sample including daily diary data was reduced further because only 709 participants completed at least some of the daily diaries, and other participants were excluded based on compliance or failure to respond to attention checks within the diaries (see Appendix D). The final diary sample was 627 individuals who completed 75% (4,703/6,270=0.75) of the possible diary signals (M=7.58, SD=3.11).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Design and Procedure</head><p>A flowchart of the study procedures can be found in Appendix C. On Day 1, participants completed a 40-minute online study consisting of a baseline survey, randomly assigned intervention condition, and an immediate posttest. The baseline survey assessed (1) sociodemographic factors, (2), perceived knowledge of COVID-19 and positive and negative affect, and (3) math tasks known to predict WNB. Then, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. In the educational intervention condition, participants completed an intervention that taught them how to calculate a case fatality rate. In the business-as-usual control condition, participants saw relevant statistics (i.e., number of deaths; number of infected individuals), but were not shown how to calculate case fatality rates. After the intervention, participants completed three problems assessing health decision-making accuracy and reported the strategy they used to solve each problem (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> and Appendix E). Additional dependent variables assessed after the intervention were health cognitions about COVID-19 and positive and negative affect. Participants also completed two individual difference measures at the end of the baseline session: need for cognition and health literacy. For the next 10 days, participants completed experience sampling one time each evening to track the impact of the educational intervention on their risk perceptions, worry, positive and negative affect, and preventive health behaviors. Note: All health decision-making problems were forced choice. We have bolded the correct responses here for readers. All strategy reports were open-ended.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sociodemographic Factors</head><p>Prior to giving informed consent, participants indicated eligibility by confirming they were 18+ years of age and held U.S. citizenship. After providing informed consent, participants answered demographic questions including: age, gender, employment status, level of educational attainment, number and type of math courses taken in high school and college, the type of device they used to complete the survey, race/ethnicity, household income, and zip code (the latter of which was beyond the scope of this paper). Responses of "Would rather not report" for the employment variable were coded as missing. Race was coded as white vs. non-white for statistical analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline Health Decision Making Problem</head><p>Participants determined which of two hypothetical diseases was more fatal in the baseline health decision-making problem. Disease A included a bigger numerator and a bigger denominator (analogous to flu statistics); Disease B included a smaller numerator and a smaller denominator (analogous to COVID-19 statistics; see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref> for the full problem). The numbers chosen in the baseline problem for Disease A were proportional to the numbers for the flu and the numbers for Disease B were proportional to COVID-19 numbers as of March 24, 2020 when the survey launched.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18</ref>   Note: All reliability measures are alphas except for the daily diary measures.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Baseline Math Tasks</head><p>The order of math attitudes and math anxiety measures was randomized. These measures were presented before the math skills measures because in past research  participants reported more negative attitudes if they completed these math tasks before rating their attitudes. The order of the math skills measures was randomized for all participants. Unrelated to the current study's hypotheses, we also collected data on several math measures to ensure that random assignment to condition was successful (i.e., fraction equivalence <ref type="bibr">[Fitzsimmons et al., in</ref> press], subjective numeracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[Fagerlin et al., 2007]</ref>, and objective numeracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[Cokely et al., 2012]</ref>).</p><p>Math Anxiety. Participants rated their overall math anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Ashcraft, 2002)</ref> and math anxiety about specific types of numbers--whole numbers, fractions, percentages and whole number frequencies--for five items on a scale ranging from 1 = "Not anxious" to 10 = "Very anxious." We calculated an average math anxiety score across items.</p><p>Math Attitudes Questionnaire. Participants answered 20 questions  pertaining to their attitudes about math in general as well as their specific attitudes about whole numbers, fractions, and percentages. This math attitudes questionnaire involves subscales for perceived ability, preferences, frequency of use, and importance. We calculated an average math attitude score across items.</p><p>Math Skills. Math skills were measured with number line estimation tasks for fractions, whole number frequencies, and percentages. In three blocks separated by type of number, participants made estimates for one fraction at a time (0-5 range; Siegler et al., 2011), one whole number frequency at a time (0 out of 100 to 100 out of 100 range), or one percentage at a time (0% to 5% range). Participants completed 9 or 10 trials in each block. Participants' performance on each trial was measured as percent absolute error <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Siegler &amp; Booth, 2004)</ref>: PAE = ((|estimatetrue value|) / numerical range) * 100.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Health Decision-Making</head><p>Immediately after the intervention, participants completed three health decision-making problems (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). The first problem assessed whether participants considered the flu or COVID-19 to be more fatal based on the numbers presented in the problem. If they selected flu, that would be consistent with WNB. The second and third problems required transferring knowledge learned during the intervention about calculating rate (for those in the experimental condition) to novel contexts. In the first near transfer problem, participants were asked to think about the dynamic nature of the fatality rate. The fatality rate for COVID-19 decreased between January 30th and February 6th (based on statistics from the WHO Situation Reports). Thus, if participants simply guessed that fatality rates increased over time, they would get this problem wrong, and their response would be consistent with WNB. In the second far transfer problem, which was presented as a story problem, participants considered rates of infection across Italy and</p><p>China 3 . This problem tested whether participants were able to apply their understanding of fatality rates to infection rates. If participants selected that China has a higher infection rate, this response would be consistent with WNB. Decision accuracy was assessed for each problem with a forced choice question (e.g., Which disease is more fatal?). Health decision-making accuracy was scored as correct or incorrect, separately for each decision-making question.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Strategy Reports and Coding</head><p>In addition to response choice, we collected strategy reports that would indicate WNB errors.

These codes reflected mentioning either the numerator or the denominator in isolation when making decisions (e.g., Look at the biggest number; How many died from it; Disease B has more people infected). For analyses, we collapsed across these three whole number bias codes. Participants who received one of the three WNB error codes but also reported a more mathematically-sophisticated strategy (i.e., indicated calculating a rate, including transformations to easier to handle numbers, such as decimals or percentages) were not included as having made WNB errors in the analyses reported below. Very few participants reported both rate and WNB strategies across the four health decision-making problems: baseline: n=14 (1%), post-intervention: n=9 (1%), near transfer: n=5 (0%), far transfer: n=12 (1%).</p><p>Two coders (MM and ES) independently coded responses from 30 participants (for a total of 120 responses); interrater reliability was high (97% interrater agreement across all codes and responses).

Risk perceptions for others were assessed with the same three items and instead referenced "family members or friends." "Do not know" responses were coded as missing data.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Analyses</head><p>The data analysis plan was pre-registered on OSF before data collection began. Analyses concerning variables assessed in the baseline session were conducted in R version 3.6.0 (R Core Team, 2019). First, we tested whether random assignment of participants to condition was successful in yielding equivalent groups at baseline for key variables. Analyses indicated that only gender was not equally distributed across conditions; thus, we controlled for gender in all subsequent analyses. Second, we conducted a series of logistic regressions testing the effects of condition (i.e., educational intervention vs. business-as-usual control) on each of the three postintervention health decision-making problems both in (1) simplified models controlling for gender alone, and in (2) "full" models. The full models controlled for gender, additional sociodemographic factors of age, race, educational attainment, expected predictors of rational number decision-making accuracy (i.e., magnitude knowledge [a composite score for PAE across three number line estimation scales], baseline health decision-making accuracy, math anxiety, math attitudes, health literacy, and need for cognition), and perceived COVID-19 knowledge. The majority of these covariates were specified in the pre-registration and were included to improve power by explaining greater variance in decision-making accuracy. We also covaried age and race because both factors have been associated with perceived disease risk (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Taber et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Third, we conducted three logistic regressions testing the effects of condition on WNB strategy reports for the three health decision-making problems assessed post-intervention, controlling for gender. Fourth, we conducted a series of linear regressions testing the effects of condition on COVID-19 risk perceptions, worry, and positive and negative affect immediately following the intervention while controlling for gender. We report the final fixed effects, including 95% CIs, for our results below.</p><p>Finally, we examined the effect of condition on daily risk perceptions, worry, affect, and health behaviors reported during the 10 days of daily diaries by applying multilevel modeling (via SAS 9.4 Proc Mixed). For analyses examining daily risk perceptions, worry, and affect, the Level 1 predictor was day (diary order), and Level 2 predictors were experimental condition and gender.</p><p>For the analysis examining health behaviors, we included affect in the model at both the state (Level 1) and trait (Level 2) level per current recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bolger &amp; Laurenceau, 2013)</ref> and because affect can be a motivating factor in behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Carver &amp; Scheier, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Ekman, 1992)</ref>.</p><p>Hence, the models relating to affect had at Level 1: day, and person-centered deviations for negative and positive affect, and at Level 2: condition, gender, and person-mean levels of negative and positive affect across the diary. We used an autoregressive error structure in each analysis, and degrees of freedom were restricted to the number of participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bolger &amp; Laurenceau, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Finally, for the immediate dependent variables of risk perceptions, worry, and affect, as well as the daily diary dependent variables of risk perceptions, worry, affect, and health behaviors, we also ran models that controlled for gender and additional sociodemographic factors (i.e., age, race, educational attainment) and variables identified as significant predictors of health decision making accuracy post-intervention (i.e., percent absolute error, math anxiety, and baseline health decision making accuracy). These analyses were conducted to determine whether any effects of condition held when controlling for multiple factors expected to also predict these outcomes.

Exclusion Criteria</p><p>Due to the nature of online sampling, we excluded participants who showed random or inattentive responding during the baseline survey and the daily diary. Of the 2,693 people who consented to participate, 832 were excluded for completing the survey in less than 13.33 minutes, or ⅓ of the length of time (40 minutes) that it took research assistants to complete the survey on average during piloting. Of the remaining 1,861 participants, 305 were excluded for failing one of two attention checks (i.e., Select answer B; Gilman et al., 2017), and two were excluded for having completed the survey more than once. Thus, our pre-analytic sample included 1,554 people.</p><p>Additional pre-registered exclusion criteria were aimed at identifying "poor responders" on the baseline math tasks. For each number line estimation task (i.e., fractions, whole number frequencies, and percentages), a participant was flagged for exclusion if they had number line estimation precision (percent absolute error, see below) that had a standard deviation of .1 or less, or if 80% of their responses within a particular numerical range were above 95% or below 5% of the line <ref type="bibr">(Fitzsimmons et al., in press;</ref>. That is, these participants had anchored their estimates at the endpoints of the number line and only placed their estimates within 10% of the number line on 80% or more of the trials. In the equivalence task, participants were flagged as poor responders for responding true or false to all items. Twenty participants were flagged as poor responders on two or more of these math tasks and excluded from analyses. Of the remaining 1,534 participants, we excluded eight participants who provided nonsensical answers to at least one of two open-ended items at the end of the study (e.g., "Is there anything else you would like to add regarding your thoughts about COVID-19?). We confirmed that these eight participants also provided nonsensical responses in their open-ended health decisionmaking strategy reports, suggesting they were not engaging with any of the open-ended items. Of these 1,526 participants, the 1,297 who answered all four forced-choice health decision-making questions comprised our analytic sample for the primary analyses.</p><p>Our analytic sample differed from those who consented to participate, yet were excluded, in terms of their age, t(2680) = 10.15, p &lt; .001, gender, X 2 (1) = 6.62, p = .01, employment status, X 2 (6) = 50.32, p &lt; .001, race/ethnicity (coded as: white vs. any other race), X 2 (1) = 182.47, p &lt; .0001, reported income, X 2 (9) = 71.06, p &lt; .001, number of math courses taken, t(2633.5) = 11.70, p &lt; .001, accuracy on an objective numeracy question (Berlin numeracy scale), X 2 (1) = 95.44, p &lt; .0001, and accuracy on the baseline health decision-making problem, X 2 (1) = 45.75, p &lt; .0001. That is, those who were excluded were more likely to be younger, female, students or selfemployed but less likely to be retired or employed for wages, be non-white, report lower income, have taken fewer math courses, and be incorrect on the objective numeracy and baseline health decision-making question. However, because our exclusion criteria aimed to identify non-human responding, these comparisons should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Of the 1,297 participants from the baseline analytic sample, 709 participants completed the daily diaries over the next 10 days. 64 participants were excluded from the daily diary sample because they responded to signals less than 2 standard deviations below the sample mean <ref type="bibr">(M= 7.58, SD = 3.11, per convention (Bolger et al., 2003)</ref>. Our analytic sample for the daily diary analyses was 627 because an additional 18 individuals failed embedded accuracy checks commonly used in online research <ref type="bibr">(Gilman et al., 2017)</ref>. The overall rate of compliance was acceptable, attrition was as expected and consistent with prior research and there were approximately 4,703 diary signals available for analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bolger &amp; Laurenceau, 2013)</ref>. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Educational Intervention</head><p>Please take a look at the numbers in the table and read all of the information carefully. The goal of these examples is to help you better understand health statistics.</p><p>A farmer is trying to decide which types of apple trees to plant for next year. He is choosing between two types of trees, which are currently in two different fields. He wants to choose based on which type of tree is least likely to rot.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of rotting apple trees Total number of apple trees</head><p>Field A 75 500 Field B 25 100</p><p>Looking at the table, it looks like more trees in Field A are rotting (75) than in Field B (25). But, notice that Field A also has many more total trees (500) than Field B (100). So, to decide which field has a higher rate of rotting trees, we cannot just compare the number of rotting trees in Field A to Field B. Instead, we must consider the number of rotten apple trees RELATIVE to the total number of trees in each field. You need to find the rotting RATE in each Field. In order to determine which disease is the most fatal, you must consider the number of deaths RELATIVE to the total number of people who were infected.</p><p>Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how you can figure out the fatality rate for each disease.</p><p>First, find the Flu fatality RATE.</p><p>Divide the number of Flu deaths (22,000) by the total number of people infected by the Flu (36,000,000). If you plug these numbers into a calculator, you will see that 22,000 / 36,000,000 = 0.00061.</p><p>Transform this into a percentage by multiplying by 100: 0.00061 * 100 = .06%. This is the fatality rate for the Flu. That's a pretty small number that is less than 1% and closer to 0% than to 5%.</p></div>
