				<p>Stimulus manipulations in perceptual decision-making tasks can be categorized into two broad categories: manipulating the quality of the sensory input (stimulus reliability) and manipulating the distance between the sensory feature of interest and the decision boundary (boundary distance). However, despite the fundamental difference between these two manipulations, it remains controversial whether they lead to dissociable behavioral effects. Here, we demonstrate the existence of robust dissociation between the effect of stimulus reliability and boundary distance on confidence and accuracy. Subjects indicated the orientation of a Gabor patch relative to a decision boundary set at 45. We manipulated the stimulus reliability and boundary distance by varying the contrast and the offset from 45, respectively. We found that, as compared to stimulus reliability, the boundary distance manipulation had larger effect on accuracy but smaller effect on confidence. Further, confidence decreased with difficulty for error trials in the boundary distance manipulation (a pattern known as &quot;folded-X pattern&quot;) but not in the stimulus reliability manipulation (i.e., a violation of the folded-X pattern). Both of these effects were replicated in a second experiment with dot motion. These results demonstrate that manipulations of stimulus reliability and boundary distance have dissociable effects on accuracy and confidence, suggesting that the mapping between confidence and accuracy depends on the specifics of how difficulty is manipulated.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Progress in understanding confidence computations has traditionally depended on experiments employing various stimulus manipulations. In perceptual decision making, researchers have manipulated numerous stimulus features to investigate how these changes affect task difficulty and confidence. For example, a task can be made harder by reducing stimulus contrast <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cannon, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lesica et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Nauhaus et al., 2009)</ref>, increasing the level of noise in the stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Adler &amp; Ma, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Magliero et al., 1984)</ref>, decreasing motion coherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Williams et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yuille &amp; Grzywacz, 1988)</ref>, or increasing the spread of stimulus features over a set of stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(de Gardelle &amp; Summerfield, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Desender et al., 2018)</ref>. Other common manipulations include decreasing the angular distance of dot motion from the choice boundary <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bang &amp; Fleming, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> de <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gardelle &amp; Mamassian, 2015)</ref>, reducing the mean distance of a cloud of dots from the center of the screen in a left/right discrimination task <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Locke et al., 2022)</ref>, and using colors closer to purple in a red/blue discrimination task <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boldt et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">de Gardelle &amp; Summerfield, 2011)</ref>.</p><p>However, despite the proliferation of different manipulations, much less work has been done on classifying these manipulations into different categories that share fundamental similarities.</p><p>One classification that has emerged in recent years is that the various stimulus manipulations can be separated into two broad categories: (1) manipulations of stimulus reliability and (2) manipulations of boundary distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bang &amp; Fleming, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">de Gardelle &amp; Mamassian, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> de <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gardelle &amp; Summerfield, 2011)</ref>. In this classification, "stimulus reliability" refers to any manipulation that changes subjects' ability to identify in absolute terms the critical feature of the stimulus that has to be judged. For example, decreasing the contrast of a Gabor patch or increasing its noise level make it more difficult to identify its tilt. Similarly, decreasing the coherence of dot motion or increasing the spread of color values in a group of circles make it more difficult to identify the direction of motion or average color. In general, low stimulus reliability leads to ambiguous stimuli where the critical feature to be judged is difficult to identify.</p><p>In contrast, "boundary distance" refers to any manipulation that changes the ability to decide the category of the stimulus without affecting the ability to identify the critical feature. For example, a Gabor patch of given contrast and noise level is more difficult to categorize as tilted clockwise or counterclockwise from 45 when its true orientation is 44 than when it is 34. In this case, the reliability of the stimulus itself does not change because orientations of 44 and 34 are equally difficult to identify in absolute terms (i.e., if subjects were asked to identify the true orientation, they would have similar levels of precision for 44 and 34 orientations). Instead, the difficulty in these manipulations comes from the critical feature being either close or far from the decision boundary. To give a different example, it is easier to determine the gender for male and female faces (far from the decision boundary) than for a male-female morph (close to the decision boundary), even if the morph image is as clear and easy to perceive as the original images. As a rule of thumb, stimulus reliability manipulations make the stimuli ambiguous and difficult to perceive, whereas boundary manipulations do not affect the clarity of the stimulus itself but make it harder to categorize as belonging to one class or another.</p><p>Recent research has sought to disentangle the effects of stimulus reliability and boundary distance on accuracy and confidence in perceptual decision-making tasks. However, the findings have been inconsistent. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zylberberg et al. (2014)</ref> investigated this issue using an orientation judgment task in which subjects (N = 31) estimated the average orientation of multiple line segments. The authors manipulated stimulus reliability by adjusting the variance of orientation jitter, and boundary distance by adjusting the mean orientation of the segments. They found that as stimulus reliability increased, accuracy improved, but confidence paradoxically decreased.</p><p>Conversely, as boundary distance increased, both accuracy and confidence increased. However, Zylberberg and colleagues did not directly compare the relative effects of stimulus reliability and boundary distance on accuracy and confidence.</p><p>De Gardelle and Mamassian (2015) addressed this gap by explicitly comparing the relative influence of stimulus reliability and boundary distance on accuracy and confidence. Subjects (N = 15) completed a random-dot motion task. They also rated which of two consecutive trials they felt more confident in. Stimulus reliability was manipulated by varying the variance of dot motion, while boundary distance was manipulated by varying the mean direction of motion relative to a horizontal reference. Their design included two conditions-low and high reliability-matched for performance using a staircase procedure that created one condition with high boundary distance and another with low boundary distance. While de Gardelle and Mamassian found stable individual-level differences in that some subjects consistently exhibited higher confidence in one condition over the other, there was no overall group-level confidence difference between the conditions.</p><p>The final two studies examined more the interaction between stimulus reliability and boundary distance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Spence et al. (2016)</ref> used a motion discrimination task in which subjects reported the direction of dot motion and indicated their confidence. Here, stimulus reliability was manipulated by varying the range of dot motion directions, while boundary distance was manipulated by varying the mean dot motion direction. The researchers found that higher stimulus reliability conditions led to higher confidence when accuracy was matched, as well as lower accuracy when confidence was matched. These findings suggest that stimulus reliability has a greater influence on confidence than accuracy. Similarly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boldt et al. (2017)</ref> used a color ensemble judgment task in which subjects (N = 20) classified arrays of colored shapes as predominantly red or blue. Stimulus reliability was manipulated by changing the variance in color, while boundary distance was manipulated by changing the mean color. By employing a factorial design, Boldt and colleagues demonstrated that high-reliability conditions consistently led to higher confidence when accuracy was matched.</p><p>As this brief overview demonstrates, previous findings have been inconsistent and the question of how stimulus reliability and boundary distance differentially affect confidence and accuracy remains unresolved. All four previous studies employed relatively small sample sizes (ranging from 8 to 31 subjects), which can lead to both false positives and false negatives. Further, none of the previous studies examined additional features of confidence judgments that can be used to dissociate between different manipulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2024b)</ref>. Specifically, it is unclear whether stimulus reliability and boundary distance produce similar folded-X patterns, where easier conditions lead to increased confidence for correct trials but decreased confidence for error trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kepecs &amp; Mainen, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we attempt to conclusively resolve the issue of whether stimulus reliability and boundary distance differentially affect confidence and accuracy. To do so, we manipulated stimulus reliability and boundary distance across two large experiments (total N = 78). In both experiments, subjects judged if visual stimuli were tilted clockwise or counterclockwise from 45°. Experiment 1 used Gabor patches, while Experiment 2 used moving dots. We manipulated stimulus reliability by varying the contrast of Gabor patches and the coherence of dot motion. In contrast, we manipulated boundary distance by varying the degree of offset from 45°. We found a clear dissociation between the effects of stimulus reliability and boundary distance in both experiments: stimulus reliability had a greater impact on confidence, while boundary distance had a greater impact on accuracy. Furthermore, in both experiments boundary distance manipulations exhibited the canonical folded-X pattern, while stimulus reliability manipulations violated the folded-X pattern. Overall, these results establish the existence of a robust dissociation between the effects of stimulus reliability and boundary distance on confidence and accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjects</head><p>We recruited 78 subjects from the Georgia Institute of Technology community for either monetary compensation ($10/hour) or course credit equivalent. All subjects reported to have normal or corrected-to-normal vision and signed informed consent before the experimental procedure. Experiment 1 had 57 subjects and Experiment 2 had 21 subjects. No subjects participated in both experiments. Subjects with accuracy lower than 55% or higher than 95% were excluded to avoid floor or ceiling effects on task performance, which could result in noisy estimates of metacognition. This led to excluding two subjects and from Experiment 1 and four subjects from Experiment 2. Experimental procedures were approved by the Georgia Institute of Technology Institutional Review Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>Each trial began with subjects fixating on a small white dot (size = 0.05°) at the center of the screen for 1 second. A Gabor patch (diameter = 4°) oriented either to the left (counterclockwise) or right (clockwise), relative to a 45° tilt, was then presented for 100 milliseconds <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>The Gabor patch was superimposed on a noisy background. Subjects judged whether the Gabor patch is tilted left (counterclockwise) or right (clockwise), relative to a 45° tilt. A red line indicating a 45° tilt was drawn on a circle for reference. Subjects then rated their confidence on a 4-point scale (1 = low confidence, 4 = high confidence). Subjects made both responses on a standard keyboard with no time constraints. The main experiment comprised 4 runs, each containing 5 blocks of 45 trials. In total, each subject completed 900 experimental trials. Subjects viewed a noisy Gabor patch tilted clockwise or counterclockwise relative to 45°, indicated its tilt, and rated their confidence on a 4-point scale. We manipulated the contrast of the Gabor patches (low, medium, high) and the degree of tilt offset relative to 45° (low, medium, high). (B) Experiment 2 design. The design of Experiment 2 mirrored that of Experiment 1, except the stimulus was random dots moving clockwise or counterclockwise relative to 45°. We manipulated the coherence of the moving dots (low, medium, high) and the degree of tilt offset relative to 45° (low, medium, high).</p><p>Stimulus reliability and boundary distance were manipulated by varying the contrast and tilt offset of the Gabor patches. For the manipulation of stimulus reliability, we sampled three levels of contrast: 0.3 (low), 0.45 (medium), and 1 (high). For the manipulation of boundary distance, we first determined each individual's threshold (T) using a staircase procedure (see below), and then sampled tilt offsets of 0.5xT (low), T (medium), and 2xT (high). Within each block, three levels of tilt offset appeared in random order, and contrast levels appeared in a random cyclic pattern such that each contrast level appeared once every three trials in random order.</p><p>Subjects underwent three training blocks and two staircase blocks before the actual experiment.</p><p>The first block always had tilt offset of 10° relative to 45°. The second practice block contained with 10 trials per level). The third practice block had three tilt levels (4°, 2°, and 1°) and that randomly interleaved over 20 trials. The three levels of contrast in the training were the same as they were in actual experiments (0.3, 0.45, 1). Subjects then performed a 2-down-1-up staircase procedure and a 3-down-1-up staircase procedure to determine the individual tilt offset (T). The thresholds from both staircase blocks were then averaged to obtain the final value T used for the tilt offset manipulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>Experiment 2 is identical to Experiment 1 except as noted below. Instead of a Gabor orientation discrimination task, we performed a dot motion direction discrimination task in Experiment 2.</p><p>The stimulus consisted of a black circle (diameter = 3°) containing 113 moving white dots.</p><p>These dots moved either to the left (counterclockwise) or right (clockwise), relative to a 45° tilt for 300 milliseconds <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1</ref>). Participants judged whether the tilt direction of the dot motion was left/right relative to a 45° tilt and reported their confidence. We manipulated the stimulus reliability by varying the motion coherence of the dot motion (motion coherence = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.7, for low, medium, and high, respectively). We manipulated boundary distance by sampling three tilt offsets (0.5xT, T, and 2xT, for low, medium, and high, respectively, where T is the individualized threshold determined by the staircase procedure). We again had three training blocks. In the first training block, the tilt offset was set to 20°. In the second training block, the tilt offsets become progressively more difficult (tilt offsets of 10°, 7°, 5°, and 3°). Finally, the tilt offsets in the third training block were 6°, 3°, and 1.5°. As in Experiment 1, subjects performed two staircase procedure to determine their individual tilt offset (T) before the experimental trials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Apparatus</head><p>The experiment was counducted in a dimly lit room. Stimuli were presented on a 21.5 inch 1920x1080 monitor with a refresh rate of 60 Hz, using a custom software written in MATLAB (The MathWorks) using the Psychophysics Toolbox <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brainard, 1997)</ref>. The viewing distance was about 60 cm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses</head><p>We first computed subjects' task sensitivity (d') and confidence on each experimental condition.</p><p>We calculated d' using the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">′ = −1 (ℎ ) − −1 ( )</formula><p>where −1 is the inverse of the cumulative standard normal distribution that transforms hit rate and false alarm rate into z scores.</p><p>We first confirmed that the stimulus reliability and boundary distance manipulation affected task sensitivity and confidence. We conducted two 3 (stimulus reliability) x 3 (boundary distance)</p><p>repeated-measures analyses of variance (RM-ANOVAs) with d' and confidence as the dependent variables. We also computed the differences between the low and high levels for both manipulations in d' and confidence. We then conducted paired t-tests to compare the effect of stimulus reliability and boundary distance.</p><p>Additionally, we examined the differences between pairs of conditions that featured different extremes. Specifically, we compared three types of trials: 1) trials with the highest level of stimulus reliability and the lowest level of boundary distance (High reliability/Low distance), 2) trials with the medium level of stimulus reliability and the medium level of boundary distance (Med reliability/Med distance), and 3) trials with the lowest level of stimulus reliability and the highest level of boundary distance (Low reliability/High distance). The comparison between these types of trials was performed using paired t-tests.</p><p>We examined the folded-X pattern where easier conditions lead to increased confidence for correct trials but decreased confidence for error trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hangya et al., 2016)</ref>. We fit linear mixedeffect models separately for correct and error trials. The models were also fit separately for the stimulus reliability and boundary distance manipulations by only modeling the manipulation of interest. The sign of the slope in the resulting model ( ) indicates whether confidence is increasing for easier conditions. The folded-X pattern corresponds to a positive slope for correct trials and a negative slope for error trials.</p><p>Finally, we performed an across-experiment comparison of confidence and d'. We averaged d'</p><p>and confidence across all trials of each experiment. We then compared the obtained average d'</p><p>and confidence between experiments using an independent-sample t-tests.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1: Gabor orientation discrimination</head><p>We first confirmed that both stimulus reliability and boundary distance manipulations affected task performance (d') and confidence. Indeed, we found main effects of stimulus reliability (F(2, 108) = 82.78, p = 1.60 X 10 -22 ) and boundary distance on d' (F(2, 108) = 252.85, p = 1.80 X 10 -41 ) <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 2A</ref>), as well as main effects of stimulus reliability (F(2,108) = 105.07, p = 4.60 X 10 -</p></div>

We quantified the effect of stimulus reliability on performance and confidence by computing the difference in d' and confidence between the low and high stimulus reliability. We similarly quantified the effects of boundary distance by computing the difference in d' and confidence between the low and high boundary distance. We found that stimulus reliability had a smaller effect on d' compared to boundary distance (t(54) = 9.31, p = 7.94 X 10 -13 , Cohen's d = 1.26). Conversely, stimulus reliability had a larger effect on confidence compared to boundary distance (t(54) = 6.01, p = 1.66 X 10 -7 , Cohen's d = .81). These findings demonstrate that stimulus reliability and boundary distance differentially impact d' and confidence.</p><p>The differential effects of the stimulus reliability and boundary distance manipulations also enabled us to examine the differences between pairs of conditions that traded off the two manipulations. Specifically, we compared trials with the highest level of stimulus reliability and the lowest level of boundary distance (High reliability/Low distance) against trials with the lowest level of stimulus reliability and the highest level of boundary distance (Low reliability/High distance). This comparison revealed a robust confidence-accuracy dissociation between these pairs of conditions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2D</ref>). Specifically, we found that the Low reliability/High distance trials had a significantly higher d' (t(54) = 7.98, p = 1.07 X 10 -10 , Cohen's d = 1.08) but lower confidence (t(54) = -6.06, p = 1.38 X 10 -7 , Cohen's d = -.82) than the High reliability/Low distance trials. These extreme pair comparisons corroborated the previous results by confirming that, compared to boundary distance, stimulus reliability has a larger effect on confidence but a smaller impact on task sensitivity. . The y-axis shows the change of d' and confidence for each manipulation from the hardest to the easiest condition. We found that boundary distance manipulation affects task sensitivity (d') more than stimulus reliability manipulation, whereas the opposite is true for confidence.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2: Motion direction discrimination</head><p>Experiment 1 demonstrated a robust confidence-accuracy dissociation between stimulus reliability and boundary distance manipulations in the context of Gabor orientation discrimination. Experiment 2 tested whether similar results would be obtained in the context of a different perceptual taskmotion direction discrimination. As in Experiment 1, we first confirmed that both stimulus reliability and boundary distance manipulations affected task performance and confidence ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A,B)</ref>. Indeed, we found that both d' and confidence were significantly modulated by both stimulus reliability (d': F(2, 32) = 13.79, p = 1.05 X 10 -5 ;</p><p>Confidence: F(2, 32) = 8.58, p = 5.00 X 10 -4 ) and boundary distance (d': F(2, 32) = 36.16, p = 3.10 X 10 -11 ; Confidence: F(2, 32) = 8.96, p = 3.71 X 10 -4 ). Specifically, d' increased by 0.63 from low to high stimulus reliability (t(16) = 4.18, p = 7.15 X 10 -4 ) and by 0.87 from low to high boundary distance (t(16) =6.68, p = 5.29 X 10 -6 ), whereas confidence increased by 0.55 from low to high stimulus reliability (t(16) =3.11, p = 6.67 X 10 -3 ) and by 0.15 from low to high boundary distance (t(16) =3.54, p = 2.73 X 10 -3 ).</p><p>Critically, we again compared the effects of stimulus reliability and boundary distance on d' and confidence ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3C</ref>). Similar to Experiment 1, compared to boundary distance, stimulus reliability had a smaller effect on d' (t(16) = 2.87, p = .01, Cohen's d = .70) but a larger effect on confidence (t(16) = 2.53, p = .02, Cohen's d = .61). Lastly, we again examined the differences between pairs of conditions that traded off the two manipulations. As in Experiment 1, we found that trials with the lowest level of stimulus reliability and the highest level of boundary distance (Low reliability/High distance) had a significantly higher d' (t(54) = 7.98, p = 1.07 X 10 -10 , Cohen's d = 1.08) but lower confidence (t(54) = -6.06, p = 1.38 X 10 -7 , Cohen's d = -.82) than trials with the highest level of stimulus reliability and the lowest level of boundary distance (High reliability/Low distance). These findings confirm the conclusion from Experiment 1 that stimulus reliability and boundary distance differentially impact d' and confidence. and confidence for each manipulation from the hardest to the easiest condition. We found that boundary distance manipulation affects task sensitivity (d') more than the stimulus reliability manipulation, whereas the opposite is true for confidence.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether stimulus reliability and boundary distance differ in their effects on other signatures of confidence computations besides overall performance or confidence. Here we examined the effects of the two manipulations on the "folded-X pattern"a pattern of results where easier conditions lead to increased confidence for correct trials but decreased confidence for error trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Kepecs &amp; Mainen, 2012)</ref>.

Specifically, larger boundary distances (which make the task easier) led to confidence increases for correct trials (Experiment 1: average = .14, t(54) = 11.56, p = 3.1 X 10 -16 , Cohen's d = 1.56; Experiment 2: average = .09, t(16) = 4.40, p = 4.4 X 10 -4 , Cohen's d = 1.07), but decreases for error trials (Experiment 1: = -.05, t(54) = -3.50, p = 9.5 X 10 -4 , Cohen's d = -0.47; Experiment 2: average = -.05, t(16) = -2.05, p = 0.057, Cohen's d = -0.79).</p><p>However, the stimulus reliability produced a violation of the folded-X pattern, and instead produced a pattern of a joint increase in confidence for both correct and error trials. Specifically, larger stimulus reliability (eaiser) led to higher confidence in both correct trials (Experiment 1: average = .25, t(54) = 10.78, p = 4.5 X 10 -15 , Cohen's d = 1.45; Experiment 2: average = .29, t(16) = 3.28, p = 4.7 X 10 -3 , Cohen's d = 0.79) and error trials (Experiment 1: average = .15, t(54) = 7.29, p = 1.4 X 10 -9 , Cohen's d = 0.98; Experiment 2: average = .16, t(16) = 1.89, p = 0.077, Cohen's d = 0.46). These results demonstrate that the stimulus reliability and boundary distance manipulations produce qualitatively different effects, with boundary distance leading to a standard folded-X pattern, whereas stimulus reliability leading to a double-increase pattern. <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>. Stimulus reliability but not boundary distance manipulations violate the folded-X pattern. The folded-X pattern refers to a specific relationship between confidence and task difficulty, where easier conditions lead to higher confidence for correct trials but lower confidence for error trials.We analyzed this pattern separately for the stimulus reliability and boundary distance manipulations. We found that the boundary distance manipulation produced the canonical folded-X pattern. However, the stimulus reliability manipulation produced a violation of the folded-X pattern and instead produced a pattern of a joint increase in confidence for both correct and error trials. Error bars show SEM. values show the average slope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study-level confidence-accuracy dissociation</head><p>Our analyses so far compared two types of manipulations (stimulus reliability vs. boundary distance) within the context of specific tasks (Gabor orientation discrimination in Experiment 1 and motion direction discrimination in Experiment 2). Here, we further explored whether confidence-accuracy dissociations may appear when comparing across experiments that employ different stimuli and tasks. Specifically, we compared the average d' and average confidence between Experiments 1 and 2. We found that the task in Experiment 1 produced significantly higher average d' than in Experiment 2 (t(70) = 2.37, p = 0.021, Cohen's d = .66; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5)</ref>.</p><p>Surprisingly, however, confidence showed the opposite pattern, with Experiment 1 leading to significantly lower average confidence than Experiment 2 (t(70) = -2.17, p = 0.034, Cohen's d = -.60). These results suggest that different stimuli and tasks may also lead to previously unexplored confidence-accuracy dissociations. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Research on confidence in perceptual tasks has employed numerous manipulations, but less attention has been paid to how the different manipulations relate to each other. In recent years, a classification has emerged that divides stimulus manipulations into two broad categories: <ref type="formula">1</ref>manipulations of stimulus reliability and (2) manipulations of boundary distance <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bang &amp; Fleming, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">de Gardelle &amp; Mamassian, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">de Gardelle &amp; Summerfield, 2011)</ref>. However, previous studies comparing the effects of the two manipulations on confidence vs. accuracy have produced inconsistent results. Here, we attempt to conclusively establish whether stimulus reliability and boundary distance differentially affect confidence and accuracy. We conducted two experiments using Gabor orientation discrimination (Experiment 1) and dot motion direction discrimination (Experiment 2). We found that stimulus reliability, as compared to boundary distance, has a smaller effect on accuracy but a larger effect on confidence. The two manipulations also had starkly different effects on the folded-X pattern. Overall, these results suggest that the two types of manipulations have dissociable effects on confidence and accuracy and that the mapping between confidence and accuracy depends on the specifics of how difficulty is manipulated.</p><p>Relationship to previous research on comparing stimulus realiability and boundary distance</p><p>Our results are in line with prior research by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Spence et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boldt et al. (2017)</ref>, both of which also found that, compared to boundary distance, stimulus realibility manipulations impact confidence more than accuracy. However, we expanded upon their findings by increasing the number of participants and allowing the manipulations of stimulus reliability and boundary distance to vary freely across different levels. This approach enabled us to explore the difference between the two manipulations in the folded-X pattern, something that has not been examined in previous studies. Overall, the results of our two experiments using different stimuli, together with those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Spence et al. (2016)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boldt et al. (2017)</ref>, indicate the existence of a robust dissociation between the effects of stimulus reliability and boundary distance on accuracy and confidence.</p><p>However, our results diverge from those in two previous reports (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gardelle &amp; Mamassian, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zylberberg et al., 2014)</ref>. De Gardelle &amp; Mamassian (2015) did not find robust group differences in the effects of stimulus reliability and boundary distance on confidence, but instead found individual differences, such that each subject consistently showed a higher confidence in either high stimulus reliability or high boundary distance across two experiment sessions. We suspect that the differences in our results may be attributed to differences in study design. For example, their sample size (15 participants) is relatively small for detecting robust group differences. Further, de Gardelle &amp; Mamassian used a more complex display consisting of two stimuli on each trial and a more complex confidence procedure where subjects judged which of every consecutive two trials they were more confident in. It is possible that the added complexity in their design coupled with a relatively small effect size reduced the power for detecting differences between the manipulations to emerge. Unlike de Gardelle &amp; Mamassian who did not find group differences between stimulus reliability and boundary distance manipulations, <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zylberberg et al. (2014)</ref> found results that on the surface appear opposite to ours. Specifically, Zylberberg et al. reported that lower stimulus reliability led to higher levels of confidence (though they did not directly compare stimulus reliability and . However, Zylberberg et al. used a very different design where the boundary distance was very close to zero, thus making the task extremely difficult. In such cases, adding noise to the images (which usually reduced reliability) can lead to spurious signals that increase confidence. Specifically, as has been argued before <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sanders et al., 2016)</ref>, overconfidence for noisy stimuli may occur because observers mistake noise as useful signals.</p><p>Confidence in correct vs. error trials (folded-X pattern)</p><p>In addition to examining the dissociation between stimulus reliability and boundary distance in confidence and accuracy, we extended previous work by examining the folded-X pattern in confidence. The folded-X pattern refers to a specific relationship between confidence and task difficulty where easier conditions lead to higher confidence for correct trials but lower confidence for error trials. This pattern has been widely regarded as a key signature of decision confidence and is considered a hallmark of confidence computation in tasks involving uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hangya et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kepecs &amp; Mainen, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>However, several studies have found violations of the folded-X pattern for specific tasks and stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kiani et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rausch et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rausch et al., , 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rausch &amp; Zehetleitner, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2024a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Van Den Berg et al., 2016)</ref>. In both of our experiments, the boundary distance manipulation produced a stereotypical folded-X pattern, but the stimulus reliability manipulation violated the folded-X pattern. However, previous studies have shown that some stimulus reliability manipulations lead to the stereotypical folded-X pattern, while others violate it <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Rausch &amp; Zehetleitner, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shekhar &amp; Rahnev, 2024a)</ref>. Thus, the type of manipulation is not the only factor that explains whether the folded-X pattern will be violated or not. Our results are consistent with the view that the folded-X pattern is violated when subjects are able to form predictions about the trial-by-trial task difficulty <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hellmann et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rausch et al., 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rausch et al., , 2021</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rausch &amp; Zehetleitner, 2019)</ref>. Indeed, in our studies, subjects could form predictions about the task difficulty based directly on the perceived contrast or coherence (i.e., by guessing the direction of the stimulus reliability manipulations) but could not do so for the boundary distance manipulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Possible other manipulation categories</head><p>We have argued that manipulations of task difficulty in perceptual decision making can generally be categorized as manipulations of stimulus reliability or boundary distance. The critical distinction between these two manipulations is that decreasing stimulus realibility increases the uncertainty of the stimulus itself, while decreasing boundary distance leaves stimulus uncertainty unaffected. One way to make this distinction concrete is to consider the effects of these manipulations on the 2-choice task of interest vs. a separate continuous identification task. In this context, a stimulus reliability manipulation is any manipulation that affects the difficulty of both the 2-choice and continuous identification tasks. Conversely, a boundary distance manipulation is any manipulation that affects the difficulty of the 2-choice task, while leaving the difficulty of the continuous identification task unchanged (because decisions in this task are not made by comparing to a boundary). Indeed, manipulations of contrast, noise, or motion coherence affect both 2-choice and continuous identification tasks. In contrast, manipulations of tilt offset or distance of a criterion in color space affect the difficulty of 2-choice tasks but do not change how well subjects can identify the absolute tilt or absolute color of the stimulus.</p><p>Based on the definition above, it appears that virtually any difficulty manipulation in purely perceptual tasks should fall under one of these categories. That being said, sometimes researchers use a combination of manipulations. For example, several papers have explored the effects of energy manipulations where both the signal and the noise of a stimulus have increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gao et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Koizumi et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Samaha &amp; Denison, 2022)</ref>. While both varying signal and varying noise are examples of stimulus reliability manipulations, their combination can act in ways that diverge from standard stimulus reliability manipulations. In other words, the distinction between stimulus reliability vs. boundary distance manipulations is meant to apply only to changes in a single dimension at a time, whereas complex manipulations that have two or more dimensions would not necessarily fall under either category.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In conclusion, our study provides compelling evidence that manipulations of stimulus reliability and boundary distance differentially affect accuracy and confidence in perceptual decisionmaking tasks. While boundary distance has a greater impact on accuracy, stimulus reliability exerts a stronger influence on confidence. These findings suggest that the relationship between confidence and accuracy is not fixed but changes based on the details of how difficulty is manipulated.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Experimental design.
