				<p>Understanding the uncertainty inherent in climate projections is crucial for robust future planning and decision-making. In a series of behavioural experiments, we show that people interpret identical projected future temperature ranges (e.g., 4°C to 7.2°C by 2100), differently as a function of their optimism or pessimism about the path that future emissions will take (current, best or worst-case). The presence of these biases raises important implications for the communication of climate futures.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Recent research has called for the scientific community to "grapple with the challenge of better understanding catastrophic climate change" or a 'Climate Endgame' <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kemp et al. (2022)</ref>. This call has led to a chorus of voices debating the potential impact of such an approach (see commentaries on <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kemp et al. (2022)</ref>, e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bhowmik, McCaffrey, and Rooney Varga (2022)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Burgess, Pielke, and Ritchie (2022)</ref>). This debate brings the issue of how to communicate the impact of different climate futures into sharp relief. A commonly used format, and the one discussed in detail in <ref type="bibr">Kemp et al.,</ref> is to define 'current', 'best' and 'worst' case scenarios based on assumptions about Greenhouse Gas emission pathways [e.g., Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) (2023)]. These scenarios are often accompanied by numerical ranges with estimates of upper and lower bounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">McVeigh (2023)</ref>. For example: 'in the worst-case scenario scientists expect an increase in average global temperature of 5.6 degrees but this might be as high as 7.2 or as low as 4' <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>The inherent uncertainty in such statements raises two immediate challenges for interpretation. First, there is deep, irreducible uncertainty about the relative likelihood of the current, best, worst, (or any number of other potential scenarios) eventuating <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kemp et al. (2022)</ref>. Second, there is uncertainty about how to interpret the relative likelihood of different values in the numerical ranges associated with different scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dieckmann, Gregory, Peters, and Hartman (2017);</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Van Der Bles et al. (2019)</ref>. These sources of un-</p><p>The data sets generated during the current study are available on the Open Science Framework. Alice Mason received funding from the ESRC (ES/T016639/1) and Ben Newell received funding from the Australian Research Council (DP190101076). certainty both independently and in combination may have significant impacts on the judgments and decisions stakeholders make on the basis of the projections <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Budescu, Por, Broomell, and Smithson (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Howe, MacInnis, Krosnick, Markowitz, and Socolow (2019)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Patt and Weber (2014)</ref>.</p><p>A decision-maker who believes that the best case is most likely may fail to pay sufficient attention to the implications of the worst-case scenario, and thus underweight potential catastrophic impacts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kemp et al. (2022)</ref>. Similarly, a belief that all values in a given range are equally likely (a uniform distribution), may yield a different perception of risks than a belief that values are approximately normally distributed, or skewed toward higher or lower values <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dieckmann et al. (2017)</ref>. Moreover, research on multi-stage probability judgment suggests that decision-makers may have difficulty separating beliefs about the most likely trajectory the climate will take (current, best or worst) from judgments about numerical ranges <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Hayes and Newell (2009)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we take a step toward understanding how laypeople's beliefs about the likelihood of future scenarios affects their interpretation of identical numerical ranges provided in climate projections. In four online experiments (N = 702) we replicate a pattern which implies the presence of 'optimism' and 'pessimism' biases: people who believe the best-case scenario is most likely to happen, show a stronger tendency to endorse lower temperature values across all three scenarios. This pattern is reversed for the 'pessimists' who believe the worst-case scenario is most likely and more strongly endorse higher values in all three cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>Participants. For all experiments, we used Prolific Academic to recruit participants online. We did not allow repeat participation across experiments. We recruited participants from the UK who were (self-reported) fluent English speakers, and had a Prolific Academic approval rating of over <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The figure shows the general structure of questions used across the experiments. In all experiments participants were presented with three different scenarios. They were then presented with five options that described the potential distribution of values and asked to select one option.</p><p>90%. We only recruited participants who believe in climate change. They were required to have answered "Yes" to the pre-screener question "Do you believe in climate change?".</p><p>For the climate scenario experiments the demographics were: n = 702, 423 Female, 273 Male, 6 unreported, age range = 19-84, M = 42.4, SD = 13.1. For the planet-based scenarios the demographics were: n = 199, 123 female, 76 male, age range = 20-75, M = 41.0, SD = 11.4.</p><p>Participants were paid a show-up fee. In Experiment 1 participants were paid £1.50. We realised that the average completion time was lower than we had anticipated and so for the remaining experiments participants were paid £0.75.</p><p>The University of Warwick Ethics committee approved all experimental work.</p><p>Procedure. In all experiments participants were presented with all three scenarios. In the best case scenario the temperatures used were 1.5°C -2.4°C with a mean of 1.9°C ; for the current scenario they were 2°C -3.6°C with a mean of 2.8°C and for the worst-case scenario they were 4°C to 7.2°C with a mean of 5.6°C . In Experiments 1 to 4 the scenarios described predicted global mean temperature rises. In Experiment 5 the scenarios referred to temperatures on fictional planets. After reading about the scenario, participants were asked the 'Distribution Question'. This allowed us to classify their response as either normal, uniform, U-shaped, left skewed or right skewed.</p><p>At the end of the climate experiments participants were also asked the "Scenario Prediction Question". They were asked to select which of the three scenarios (current trajectory, best-case or worst-case) they thought was most likely to happen.</p><p>The procedural variations across experiments and the exact wording for each experiment are reported in the Supple-mentary Information. <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Panel A. Each row shows a different group of participants (maintainers, optimists, pessimists), according to which scenario they thought was most likely to happen (current, best, worst, respectively). There were different numbers of participants in each of the groups (Maintainer n = 428, Optimist n = 144, Pessimist n = 130). Each column shows participants' perception of the distribution underlying the three different scenarios (Current, Best, Worst). The labels on the X-axis correspond with the descriptions (a-e) presented in Panel A: a) Uniform; b) Normal; c) U-shaped; d) Upper; and e) Lower. Panel B. In an additional experiment the climate change context was removed and people were given the best estimate and range for temperature rises on fictitious planets. The graphs show the proportion of participants who responded with each distribution type when the same numeric values were used but the climate context was removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The results provide a clear demonstration that the same numerical intervals are interpreted very differently by people who exhibit contrasting expectations about the way in which our climate will evolve.</p><p>This central result is displayed in panel A of Figure 2 which collapses across the data from four experiments (variations between each experiment were mostly procedural and did not impact the overall patterns). Participants were presented with projected global mean temperature increases un-der three different scenarios described as 'best', 'worst', and 'current' <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>. In addition to choosing a distribution for each scenario, participants indicated which scenario they believed was most likely to occur. The majority of our participants, (61%) endorsed the 'current trajectory' as most likely (labelled as the 'maintainers', top row, <ref type="figure">Figure 2A)</ref>. These participants show a pattern favouring 'normal' or 'uniform' distributions under a current-scenario, but switch to increased endorsement of a skew toward the higher end of the range for the best-case scenario and the lower end of the range for the worst-case scenario. This pattern might reflect a form of regression toward an overall perceived most likely temperature increase. This speculation is supported by an additional experiment which found a median value of 3°C when participants were asked to report the most likely temperature increase by 2100 (see section below for details).</p><p>We described participants who chose the best case as most likely as the 'optimists' (20% of participants, second row <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>). These include people who endorse uniform and normal, but have a stronger tendency than the 'maintainers' to select a skew toward lower values in each scenario. Finally, those we termed the 'pessimists' (19%, third row of <ref type="figure">Figure 2A</ref>), chose the worst case as most likely and tend to favour distributions skewed toward higher values in every scenario. These visual impressions are supported by a multinomial logistic regression showing a significant effect of both the scenario (χ 2 (8) = 208.1, p &lt;.001) and participants' predicted scenario on their distributional perceptions (χ 2 (24) = 255.6, p &lt;.001). The dependent variable was distribution type and the "Normal" distribution was used as the reference group. For scenario and for predicted scenario, the "Current" scenario was used as the reference group. The standardised coefficients for the model containing both scenario and predicted scenario are reported in full in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p><p>Further support for our interpretation that prior beliefs about the likelihood of different climate trajectories affect the interpretation of projected temperature ranges comes from a final experiment in which, rather than providing participants with projections based on current, best-or worst-case scenarios, we told them that the projections were for three fictional planets (Alpha, Beta &amp; Gamma). Removing prior expectations about climate change -by placing the projections in a fictional context -led the majority of participants to endorse a normal distribution for all three ranges ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>; no effect of context: χ 2 (4) = 8.43, p = .39). This response pattern presumably reflects a more ingrained prior that in the absence of any other information, distributions are likely to be normal <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dieckmann et al. (2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of Age and Gender on Predicted Scenario</head><p>We collected Age and Gender data from participants in each of the Experiments. The data for Experiment 1 was anonymized immediately and cannot be linked to individual participants' responses. In Experiments 2 to 4, we examined whether there were any differences in Age and Gender among people who believed each of the scenarios (Current, Best, Worst) was most likely to happen. Two people were excluded from this analysis: one did not provide their age, and another didn't provide their gender.</p><p>We then examined whether the average age and sex composition were different among these three groups: Maintainers, Optimists, and Pessimists. On average, Pessimists (M = 39.1, SD = 1.15) were significantly younger than both Optimists (M = 45.1, SD = 1.29) -see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 3</ref>. A oneway ANOVA found that the average age was significantly different across groups (F(2, 594) = 6.13, p = .002). Pairwise corrected comparisons found a significant difference in age between the Maintainers and the Pessimists (t(594) = 2.47, p = .035) and between the Optimists and the Pessimists (t(594) = 3.49, p = .002) but not between the Maintainers and the Optimists (t(594) = −1.82, p = .163).</p><p>A chi-square test found no significant difference in the number of males and females in each of the groups (χ 2 (2) = 5.30, p = .071). The group composition was as follow: Maintainers -Female = 233, Male =133); Optimists -Female = 64, Male =54; Pessimists -Female = 71, Male =39.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Predicted Temperature Rise Experiment</head><p>To better understand people's prior beliefs about global mean surface temperature increases we asked an additional sample of 196 people (126 female, 74 male, age range =20-77, M = 39.2, SD =12.7) to answer the following question: "Scientists expect global temperatures to increase by some number of degrees by 2100. Tell us what you think the increase will be. Please give your answer in degrees C to one decimal place". The distribution of the responses in plotted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 4</ref>; the mean value reported was 6.16 degrees <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> Standardised coefficients, p-values and odds ratios for the multinomial logistic regressions run across all Experiments. The Normal distribution was the reference group for Distribution type and the Current scenario was the reference group for the Scenarios.</p><p>Best  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Our sample was pre-screened to include only participants who 'believe' in climate change (see Methods) thus a key contribution is to show that even among 'believers', optimism/pessimism about our collective ability to achieve emissions-cuts has a significant impact on the interpretation of projections. These results complement and extend previous findings showing that scepticism about climate change influences distribution-perception, and other statements of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Budescu et al. (2014)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dieckmann et al. (2017)</ref>. They are also broadly consistent with more general frameworks highlighting the role of motivated cognition, and/or accuracy-reasoning on the interpretation of climate changerelated information <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bayes and Druckman (2021)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Kahan et al. (2012)</ref>. It is worth noting that our goal with this work is not to argue for a correct interpretation. It is impossible to decide which trajectory is, in fact, most likely and in many cases, given the potential for sampling bias in the models included, there may not be a technically correct answer for the nature of the distribution underlying the projected temperature ranges (although in the limit, a normal distribution might be expected Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change (IPCC) (2023).</p><p>Future work could focus on how these differences in perception might translate into the judgments, decisions and behaviours that people, and organisations are willing to make. Understanding the perception of the risks communicated by climate projections is becoming increasingly important across a variety of sectors. Not least, in the financial domain where developments in the legislation pertaining to climaterisk disclosures is requiring businesses to report climate resilience against different future possible states of the climate (e.g the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures). For example, the Australian Treasury is currently proposing to allow businesses to select at least two possible scenarios of future global temperature increases. Allowing this freedom to choose scenarios places the onus on the business to understand the uncertainties inherent in the likelihood of the scenarios and the likelihood of values in the ranges.</p><p>Differences in risk perception may also help to shed light on the emergence of varying policy preferences based on the same climate information <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Constantino and Weber (2021)</ref>. Simply increasing the discourse around the potential scenarios may help people to understand the uncertainty in climate scenarios and could shift both their priors and their behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Howe et al. (2019)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kemp et al. (2022)</ref>. The fact that the Pessimists in our sample tended to be younger on av-erage than Optimists and Maintainers provides a salutary indication of how the reality of potential climate futures might be perceived differently as a function of age. Indeed, worstcase scenarios are typically underrepresented in climate communication, perhaps for fear of increasing the psychological burden of climate change particularly among younger generations Palinkas and Wong (2020). However, recent work has suggested that increased climate anxiety could be a motivating force for behaviour change <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Whitmarsh et al. (2022)</ref> and worst-case scenarios can facilitate people taking action <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Joslyn, Savelli, and Nadav-Greenberg (2011)</ref>. These results accord with the Climate Endgame proposal reinforcing the idea that a more inclusive discussion about all potential climate futures could lead to more robust and prudent climaterisk management <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kemp et al. (2022)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc>The figure shows the distribution of age of participants in each of the three groups: Maintainers, Optimists and Pessimists.
