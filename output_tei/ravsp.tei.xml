			<abstract>
				<p>The naiveté of the dominant &apos;cognitive-miser&apos; metaphor of human thinking hampers theoretical progress in understanding how and why subtle behavioral interventions-&apos;nudges&apos;-could work. We propose a reconceptualization that places the balance in agency between, and the alignment of representations held by, people and choice architects as central to determining the prospect of observing behaviour change. We argue that two aspects of representational (mis)alignment are relevant: cognitive (how people construe the factual structure of a decision environment) and motivational (the importance of a choice to an individual). Nudging thinkers via the alignment of representations provides a framework that offers theoretical and practical advances and avoids disparaging people&apos;s cognitive capacities.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It is now commonplace to hear that addressing the grand challenges of today's society requires substantial changes in behaviour. Such calls come not only from the academy (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bergquist, Thiel, Goldberg, &amp; van der Linden, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Van Bavel et al., 2020)</ref>, but also from politicians (e.g., President Obama's executive order encouraging the use of behavioural science 1 ), regulators (e.g., the Australian Securities and Investment Commission highlighting the importance of behavioural science for policy 2 ), and the United Nations (e.g., the UN Secretary General's guidance note on Behavioural Science 3 ). These calls to arms place psychological and behavioural science at the forefront of understanding how such widespread change can be achieved. Answering the call has led many researchers to make bold claims for the potential of simple techniques that facilitate positive behaviour change without impinging on people's freedom of choice <ref type="bibr">(Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2008)</ref>. These techniques, collectively and colloquially known as 'nudges' capitalize on promoting 'desirable' options by making changes to the choice architectures (physical, social, and psychological) in which decisions are made.</p><p>Discussions about the effectiveness of nudges are receiving increasingly widespread coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chater &amp; Loewenstein, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hallsworth, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Maier et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Simmons, Nelson, &amp; Simonsohn, 2022)</ref>. Such debate is welcome and necessary given the importance of the challenges we must address and the potential for the low-cost, quick-win policy instruments that nudges seemingly represent. However, much of this recent debate has centered on questions about 'what works and when does it work' at the expense of questions about how and why (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Osman et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Szaszi et al., 2018)</ref>. Such focus is understandable; a government that wants rapidly to encourage people to wear masks or stay at home may not care all that much about why a particular nudge works, it just wants to know that it will work, and quickly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NUDGES FOR THINKERS 4</head><p>In the long run, however, this approach is self-defeating: if we do not understand why a technique works and then it stops working, we are unlikely to know how to make it work again.</p><p>Without a deeper understanding, we cannot know how long a particular nudge will work -or if it would work at all in a novel situation (i.e., that is not the unique one it was originally observed in).</p><p>Offering these techniques to governments without such an understanding may even undermine the credibility of behavioural scientists. Despite a general sense that there is something called "Nudge Theory" (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Cai, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schmitdke &amp; Vlaev, 2020)</ref>, the promise of such a theory seems like a mirage given the assortment of often loosely defined and tangentially related intervention techniques in the choice architect's toolbox (see for example the MINDSPACE map in Annex 1 of <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dolan et al., 2010)</ref>. Attempts to overcome this chaotic state of affairs are often responses to practical considerations and so focus on providing organizing principles -such as taxonomies <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Michie et al., 2011)</ref> or meta-analyses <ref type="bibr">(Mertens et al., 2021)</ref>. While these are helpful tools for practitioners, they can lead to a "throw everything at the wall and see what sticks" approach to testing nudges, thereby offering little in terms of coherent explanations for why and when nudges work and substantially constraining how general our understanding of them can become 4 .</p><p>To overcome this limited approach, here we offer a simple unified theoretical perspective of how and why nudges could work. Central to this perspective is challenging the cognitive miser metaphor that pervades the theorizing about nudging -that people are lazy, capacity-limited, and largely unaware of the reasons underlying their behavior. This metaphor invites a passive-actor framing, but it is over-simplified and unjustified. In order to advance our understanding of how and why nudges work, we need to take more seriously the idea that people are thinkers -active agents in determining their behaviour and not passive recipients unthinkingly swayed by subtle changes in the environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NUDGES FOR THINKERS 5</head><p>We build our case by 1) reviewing the deficiencies in the cognitive miser metaphor in nudge research, 2) arguing that methods currently promoted in the field (such as meta-analyses) cannot overcome these shortcomings, and 3) presenting a novel theoretical framework that can overcome the limitations of the prevailing approach, but that also reveals strong boundaries on when we can expect nudges to work. We conclude with a discussion of the practical consequences of this framework for future research on behavioural interventions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deficiencies in the cognitive miser metaphor</head><p>The theoretical foundations of nudges are derived from two stylized ideas about human thinking. The first is that all else equal, we tend to avoid mental effort. Thinking is costly and thus aversive and so if we can conserve our mental resources we will <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kahneman, 2011)</ref>. The second is the idea that mental processes can be dichotomized and compartmentalised into different boxes that house styles of thinking that in some way align or coalesce <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Evans &amp; Stanovich, 2013</ref>). There are as many versions of this idea as there are papers written about it, but broadly speaking one box, 'System 1', captures automatic thinking that tends to be fast, associative, and operate independently of working-memory. The other box, 'System 2', is the slower, deliberative system that relies on rules, is capacity-limited and cognitively effortful.</p><p>The combination of these two ideas -that effortful thinking is aversive, but that we have a system that can think automatically -leads to the seductive notion that people's behaviour can be influenced via interventions that operate on System 1, while bypassing System 2 altogether. If done successfully such interventions offer the promise of achieving what is often perceived as effortful behaviour change via an effortless channel. For example, rather than exhorting people to NUDGES FOR THINKERS 6 eat low-fat foods via information campaigns, just place those foods in more convenient places in supermarkets or canteens, where they are more likely to be 'unthinkingly' chosen.</p><p>Despite claims that dual-system dichotomies should only be considered metaphors, or devices to help organise thinking about thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chater, 2018)</ref>, the general framework and its combination with the notion of humans as cognitive misers has become widely adopted in the nudge literature (see related criticisms in <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hertwig &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grüne-Yanoff, 2017 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Mols et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The idea that we need to influence the unthinking 'lazy' part of our cognitive apparatus in order to achieve change has garnered proponents from the World Bank (2015) to the National Academy of Sciences (2015) as well as countless consultancies promoting their tools for capitalizing on the powers of automatic thinking.</p><p>There are several reasons to be sceptical about this characterization of human thinking as helpful for informing nudge techniques. The claim that mental effort is aversive is partly countered by evidence of engagement in cognitive activities that require apparently costly thinking. From solving the daily Wordle, to completing crosswords, Sudokus, and playing computer and strategy games like chess, it is clear that at least some of the time some people like to think and challenge their mental capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Embrey, Donkin, &amp; Newell, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Inzlicht, Shenhav, &amp; Olivola, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Thomson &amp; Oppenheimer, 2022)</ref>. The discrepancy between avoiding and seeking mental effort presumably arises because the goals or motivation for pursuing effortful activities can differ both within individuals (e.g., across time or tasks) and between individuals (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Embrey, Mason, &amp; Newell, 2024)</ref>. This heterogeneity suggests that the current approach to nudging predicated on the blanket assumption that people will generally choose to avoid effort is likely to be insufficient.</p><p>Just as there is heterogeneity in preference for effort so there will be heterogeneity in the fit NUDGES FOR THINKERS 7 between people and techniques designed to prompt engagement or circumvent thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bryan, Tipton, &amp; Yeager, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>The evidence for the breadth of behaviours that can be influenced in the absence of awareness is on similarly shaky foundations. Much of subtle behaviour change-intervention is predicated on the questionable notion that we are often unaware of the reasons why we behave as we do. This view, frequently attributed to the seminal work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Nisbett and Wilson (1977)</ref>, has led to the proliferation of claims about the power that subtle environmental cues can have on a range of behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bargh, 2017)</ref>. While many of the studies on which these claims are based remain prominent in practitioners' handbooks and recommendations (e.g., the 'P' in the MINDSPACE acronym mentioned above stands for priming, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dolan et al., 2010)</ref>, the academic literature is now much more sanguine about the reliability and relevance of this literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Newell &amp; Shanks, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Ritchie, 2020)</ref>. In large part this shift in opinion has been driven by failures to replicate studies that purported to find evidence for unconscious influences on our behaviour (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">O'Donnell et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Shanks et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Shanks et al., , 2015</ref>. At the very least, these studies raise flags about the importance of factors outside of our awareness influencing the higher-level cognitive activities of the kind usually targeted by nudges.</p><p>The major concern then is that the current theoretical underpinnings of nudges are based on literatures that are at worst outdated and irrelevant and at best admitting of much more nuanced interpretations. Our contention is that this misguided application of the cognitive-miser metaphor in attempting to understand 'why nudges work' has dominated -and paralysed -the current behavioural intervention-approach. The main reason for this paralysis is that the way the metaphor has been applied is too vague and flexible and thus offers little in the way of clear predictions about when or why a technique might work 5 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NUDGES FOR THINKERS 8</head><p>In order to overcome the 'do they/don't they work' question, we propose an alternative framework to understand how nudges could work in a world where people are active agents in determining their behaviour and not passive unthinking recipients of information who are buffeted around within a pre-determined choice architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">6</ref> . However, before pursuing this line of argument we first consider another approach for assessing the effectiveness question -metaanalyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The what and when but not the 'why'</head><p>Meta-analyses are useful tools for identifying the kinds of nudges that are effective, and the situations in which they are effective, but they shed little light on the reasons why techniques fail or succeed. For example, a meta-analysis by Jachimowicz and colleagues <ref type="formula">(2019) compared</ref>default nudges -where one option is pre-selected for people -across consumer choice, environmental, and health domains. They found that defaults have larger effects in consumer choice contexts than environmental contexts, and stated that "We can only speculate about why this occurs … Perhaps consumer preferences are less strongly held than preferences in other domains and environmental preferences more strongly" (p.176). This conclusion suggests that the domain of the default nudge is not really the important factor in its efficacy, but rather some other dimension (in this case, strength of preference) that offers greater explanatory power.</p><p>A similar conclusion can be drawn from a recent large scale meta-analysis of choice architecture interventions. <ref type="bibr">Mertens and colleagues (2022)</ref> analyzed data from over 200 studies across a range of intervention techniques and domains concluding that overall, interventions promote behaviour change with a small to medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.45). Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Münscher et al., (2016)</ref>, they categorized techniques as targeting decision information, decision NUDGES FOR THINKERS 9 assistance, and decision structure. A key finding of the meta-analysis was that structure interventions, those which aim to make it simpler to choose 'better' options via the setting of defaults or removal of 'frictions', were more consistently effective at promoting behaviour-change than the information or assistance techniques. Mertens and colleagues speculate that the higher effectiveness of the decision-structure interventions may be due both to the lower demand on information processing of the structure relative to the information and assistance techniques and the fact that they are less likely to engage people in deliberative assessment of the goals and values relevant for a particular decision. To illustrate this last point, the authors suggest that nutritional labels -a popular decision information technique -are more effective for consumers who are already concerned about their health than those who are not. In essence, Mertens et al., argue that information and assistance techniques are likely to be more susceptible to the heterogeneity in values and goals that might be triggered when people are confronted with such interventions, thereby potentially weakening their overall effectiveness in the general population.</p><p>This conclusion is important, albeit still constrained by the desire to compartmentalize interventions into automatic or deliberative boxes. Its importance lies in highlighting an underappreciated aspect of why different techniques might work: namely the degree to which any attempt to change behaviour can be construed as a social interaction between the person who is attempting to invoke that change (the choice architect) and the person whose behaviour is being targeted <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(de Ridder et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">McKenzie et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Krijnen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sher et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>But a meta-analytic approach can get us only so far in the pursuit of understanding why this interaction is important. This is partly because meta-analyses are limited by the quality of their inputs; failure to include studies that do not see the light of day because they did not 'work' (a publication bias) can lead to overestimates of the effectiveness of nudges. Indeed, critics argue that NUDGES FOR THINKERS 10 when statistically controlling for this problem, the purported effects found in the meta-analysis fully disappear or are at least substantially reduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Maier et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Szaszi et al., 2022)</ref>. Such statistical debates notwithstanding, meta-analyses cannot reveal the reasons why different techniques might flourish or fail, because they only offer us a snapshot of what worked at some point in the (recent) past -thus limiting their ability to contribute to the "nudge theory" problem.</p><p>To advance our understanding, we need to build theories that incorporate values, goals, and preferences and move away from the effort-avoiding, automaton passive-actor framing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cognitive misers vs. active thinkers: Tipping the balance of agency</head><p>Nudge research has relied on the cognitive miser metaphor for a theoretical foundation, according to which systematic cognitive biases -a set of behaviours deviating from what researchers expect as optimal -arise due to people's purported tendency for mental laziness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kahneman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2009)</ref>. Nudges supposedly exploit these biases, which serve as effortless System 1 pathways effecting effortful behaviour change. Although relying on this framework may be intuitively appealing as people's phenomenological experiences often map onto the vague labels of the metaphor, the many shortcomings that we have reviewed previously naturally raise the question of whether a better alternative exists.</p><p>Here we outline and argue in favour of such an alternative, which frames people as active thinkers whose aim is to understand their environments increasingly better in order to make better decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Szollosi &amp; Newell, 2020)</ref>. Under this view, people deviate from researchers' expectations not because they are predisposed to be biased, but because their respective representations of the choice environment are misaligned -they do not construe the choice that they are facing similarly. A crucial difference from the prevailing view is that these misalignments NUDGES FOR THINKERS 11 (mistakes or biases) can be corrected: representations can become better aligned through processes that we argue are responsible for the effects of existing nudges and that can be built on when designing future ones.</p><p>The reason as to why mistakes may appear pervasive and incorrigible 7 is that they build representations in a substantial part from background knowledge that is stable over longer timeframes (e.g., common-sense cultural knowledge, material taught in schools, etc.). As such, the mistakes that they lead to can be similar across people and over extended time periods, which can</p><p>give the appearance of pervasiveness if measured in sufficiently quick succession. However, just because a representation only changes over longer timeframes does not mean that it should be considered as an unchangeable feature of people's decision-making processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Szollosi, Donkin, &amp; Newell, 2023)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Misaligned representations</head><p>To develop our perspective, we propose two types of representational (mis)alignment: cognitive and motivational. These map onto the idea that people can either construe the factual structure of a decision environment differently (cognitive) or they can think differently about the importance of a particular choice (motivational). From a cognitive standpoint, when people make mistakes on tasks often held up as examples of the biased nature of people's cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref> these mistakes could occur because participants construe the task differently from the experimenter -for instance, due to not having the requisite understanding of probabilistic principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Koehler, 1996)</ref>, or because they rely on other task-relevant information that the experimenter failed to consider <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Sher &amp; McKenzie, 2006)</ref>. From the motivational standpoint, the mistakes could simply be a result of participants not finding the task particularly interesting or NUDGES FOR THINKERS 12 worthy to engage with at a more substantial level than responding randomly or superficially (cf., <ref type="bibr">Krefled-Schwalb, Sugerman, &amp; Johnson, 2024)</ref>. Note that this is not a general tendency to be lazy, but an active inferential process about what they find interesting, and whether solving the task properly fits within their goals -some people may find it interesting to solve these tasks well.</p><p>These two ways in which representations can be misaligned are important for nudge research, as together they provide a more unified way to understand how interventions can work and points to a more robust framework for building them. Notably, this framing eschews many of the problems stemming from the cognitive miser metaphor: people are not predisposed to be cognitively lazy (although they can be when they are unmotivated) and biased (although they can make correctable mistakes). This is an improvement in the sense that it replaces the blanket assumptions of laziness and bias (which only specify tendencies) with the more concrete psychological concepts of motivation and understanding (which explain more clearly when we should expect more or less engagement and why). Another advantage is that this way, people's behaviour can be changed not by exploiting their biases, but through methods that treat them as actors with high agency.</p><p>These ideas dovetail with recent suggestions that we should consider people's agency when their behaviour is aimed to be changed, instead of assuming that they are merely being passively influenced by the choice architect (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banerjee et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">de Ridder et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Hertwig &amp; Grüne-Yanoff, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Madsen et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">McKenzie et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Krijnen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Sher et al., 2022)</ref>. One example of this is the PreDICT framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Krijnen et al., 2017)</ref> that holds that nudging is at least in part a social sensemaking endeavour in which the person's choice is the result of their (implicit) communication with the choice architect. Another is the boosting approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hertwig &amp; Grüne-Yanoff, 2017</ref>) that aims to help people exercise their own agency by strengthening their NUDGES FOR THINKERS 13 existing competences or building new ones via simple interventions. Our approach builds on the same underlying idea and extends it by providing a unifying explanation for why the success of any attempt at behaviour change depends on the representations in both the choice architect and the decision maker -and more specifically, by the active steps taken by both of them to bring these representations into alignment.</p><p>Our approach overlaps to some extent with taxonomical models of behaviour change (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Duckworth, Milkman, &amp; Laibson, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Michie et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Michie, Van Stralen, &amp; West, 2011)</ref> that identify similar factors as essential precursors for behaviour change. While these models are useful orientational tools for basic and applied research alike, the present approach complements these frameworks by providing an explanation as to how these psychological factors work and how they can lead to behaviour change. As we argued above, such an understanding is vital for us to understand why and when nudges might work or might stop working -an understanding that taxonomical approaches cannot (and do not purport to) provide. We contend that an increased focus on representational alignment can offer fertile ground for further theoretical development.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Nudging thinkers by aligning representations</head><p>The active thinker framing of the researcher-participant relationship readily applies to the choice architect-decision maker relationship as well. Specifically, when the default behaviour of a decision maker is considered suboptimal by the choice architect, it can be the result of the decision maker's different factual understandings of the decision environment, their motivation to achieve different goals in that environment, or a mixture of both. What needs to happen for behaviour change to occur is for the relevant aspects of the representation to become better aligned NUDGES FOR THINKERS 14 between the architect and the decision maker -a process that can occur via a range of different pathways.</p><p>Although representational alignment develops primarily through relatively slow and effortful means such as education and the broader cultural transmission of knowledge, there are simpler, low-cost pathways through which nudges can increase it albeit by a much more limited extent. Such interventions can influence behaviour through three main pathways (illustrated on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>): a) they can work by serving as reminders of behavioural goals that the decision maker already had but momentarily forgot about; b) they can work through the persuasion of the decision maker that the recommended behaviour is beneficial for them; and c) they can work by implying threat to the decision maker if they do not follow the recommendations of the choice architect. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NUDGES FOR THINKERS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>15</head><p>A choice architect can use any nudge to influence the decision maker's behaviour when their representations are highly aligned, both at the cognitive and motivational levels (green region on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). As the most likely source of unaligned behaviour under such conditions is that inattention temporarily misaligned representations, any nudge can remind the decision maker of their previously set goals. The domain of healthy food choice provides good examples (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bucher et al., 2016)</ref>. In this case, we can expect nudges to work when the decision maker agrees with the choice architect on what a healthy choice is and wants to generally eat healthy, but temporarily forgets about this (perhaps not strongly formed) goal. From this perspective we can also derive the expectation that such a nudge will not work when representations are misaligned either cognitively or motivationally. For example, if the decision maker does not share the representation of what constitutes healthy or unhealthy food, or what effects the consumption of those foods might have on their health, we should not expect this type of nudge to influence their behaviour. Similarly, independent from whether they share the representation at the cognitive level, we should also not expect nudges to work when the decision maker does not think that healthy eating behaviour is important or is a desirable goal.</p><p>In these latter cases, when representational alignment is somewhat lower (orange region on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>), a way in which nudges can still work is by persuading the decision maker. Examples of this include employer recommendations for pension schemes or health insurance providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Benartzi et al., 2017)</ref>. These nudges can work through increasing either cognitive or motivational alignment. For example, cognitively, they can make the decision maker recognise and address a mistaken or neglected aspect of their representation (e.g., by trusting that the choice architect making the recommendation had their best interest in mind when they did not have time to evaluate NUDGES FOR THINKERS 16 every option -or, when there is no trust or when the stakes are high, by prompting a more detailed evaluation of the options). Motivationally, such nudges can make people recognise the importance of a problem that they previously may not have considered a problem (e.g., by making younger people aware of the existence and importance of pension schemes).</p><p>When the level of representational alignment is low (red region on <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>) -because the decision maker strongly disagrees on facts, importance, or both -only nudges that imply threat can work. For example, sending personalised letters about unpaid taxes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hallsworth et al., 2017)</ref> can imply an immediate threat of legal action (compared to when those letters are more generically phrased). In other cases, when the nudge cannot be interpreted as a threat and representational content is not shared, the nudge will fail to work. For example, most food choice nudges cannot evoke a threatening interpretation and as such will not overcome such strong misalignment of representations when they exist.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The limits of nudges</head><p>Understanding how nudges work through representational alignment also illuminates the limits of what they can be expected to achieve. Specifically, it identifies the limits of nudges as people's actual understanding of and/or goals within their environments. Although these might sound self-evident or trivial concerns, as representational content and motivation is determined by a multitude of factors (e.g., cultural knowledge, people's own knowledge and experiences, situational elements) the space of shared representational content between choice architects and decision makers quickly diminishes with increasing representation variability. This is particularly relevant for representations about contentious or personally important issues that nudges are often aimed at (e.g., health, financial, and environmental behaviours), because they can and do vary greatly across people both at cognitive and motivational levels.</p><p>Another limit this view highlights is for meta-analytic <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Mertens et al., 2022)</ref> and largescale experimental <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Milkman et al., 2021)</ref> methods in nudge research, as foreshadowed earlier.</p><p>This is because these methods can only show a snapshot of how effectively a nudge currently works, but when the representations that underlie the behaviour change, the nudge might stop working generally. Note that this criticism holds irrespective of how well-conducted the metaanalysis was <ref type="bibr">(cf., Meier et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Szaszi et al., 2022)</ref>. For example, imagine that using the currently available best meta-analytic technique we estimate that a specific nudge has a reliably medium effect-size on healthy food choice. In what sense should we expect this nudge to work generally? People a couple hundred years ago would have found such nudges meaningless, as their representation of their choice environment primarily centred around finding and consuming any available food. People a couple hundred years from now might represent their environment differently for other reasons: perhaps new research will have identified other types of food as healthy and unhealthy, or perhaps medicine will have advanced to a degree where diseases resulting from unhealthy food can be cured with ease.</p><p>These somewhat outlandish examples illustrate the transient nature of people's representations well, and -more relevant for practitioners aiming to change current-day behaviour -it is not hard to think of representations that have changed on much shorter time frames (e.g., the rapidly changing views on the benefits of mask use, lockdowns, or vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic -cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Madsen et al., 2024)</ref>. In none of these cases should we expect the nudge to have the same effect it once produced in a mega-study or meta-analysis under the different respective representations. Instead, under the view we outlined, the results of mega-studies and NUDGES FOR THINKERS 18 meta-analyses can only be taken into consideration after the possibility of representational misalignment is accounted for (e.g., by monitoring representational change over time, or documenting current differences between cultures).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical consequences for future research</head><p>Our theoretical reassessment of how and why nudges can be expected to work has farreaching practical relevance for future nudge research and potentially even for broader behaviour change research. There are two main ways in which we can deploy this theory in practice: 1) assessing representational alignment and 2) developing nudges based on that assessment. By improving the fit between the choice architect's and the decision maker's representation, both of these steps can aid in developing better interventions. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows examples of the first step of this process: identifying the representational misalignment of the choice architect and the decision maker in popular domains of nudging. We expand on one of these examples -the example about financial decisions -below to illustrate how considering the extent of representational alignment can help derive expectations about when and what kind of nudges could work best. Assessing the extent of the target population's representational misalignment can serve as a useful starting point. This could proceed through asking a sample of people we aim to nudge about both the cognitive and motivational aspects of their representation (e.g., via a survey and/or relatively unstructured interviews, but in some cases, we can infer important dimensions on a NUDGES FOR THINKERS 20 theoretical basis), with the aim of identifying whether they share the underlying representation of the decision problem and how important they consider the choice.</p><p>For pension decisions, we may identify as the most relevant cognitive dimensions for people's decisions whether people understand how pension funds work and how feasible it would be for them to make contributions. That is, decision makers might have a clear understanding of the various funds and schemes they could contribute to or they might not -and similarly they may or may not think that they have sufficient income to make contributions. Note that the idea that they have a decent understanding of options and the means to contribute (i.e., that their representation of the factual side of the problem is the same as the choice architect's) is often implicit in how nudges are currently developed.</p><p>On the motivational side, personal importance of retirement saving and the reasons underpinning that goal might be important dimensions. For example, some of the people who do not share this goal with the choice architect may not want to save because they have not thought about it in detail, while others may think it is too far in the future and they can start later, or have a different conception about how much is 'enough' for retirement (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Goldin, Homonoff, Patterson, &amp; Skimmyhorn, 2020)</ref>. Note, again, that the assumption that the decision maker's goal is in alignment with the architect's goal is often implicit in current nudge development.</p><p>With the extent of representational alignment assessed, we can now start selecting particular nudges to use. From our earlier discussion we know that the more the representations align the more we can expect nudges to work. For people with highly aligned representationsthose who understand how pensions work, have the means, and want to contribute -any type of nudge would work, since if they are not already contributing it is presumably due to inattention.</p><p>For people misaligned in their factual understanding -for example, if they do not have the relevant NUDGES FOR THINKERS 21 information -persuasive nudges might work. For example, employer ranking of various pension fund options could help people gather more information for their choice. People misaligned on other dimensions -people who do not have the means or specifically do not want to contributelikely cannot be influenced through nudges unless they have coercive implications (such as government mandated enrolment). The other examples in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, relating to health and climaterelated behaviours show how misalignments in those domains can lead to nudge-failures. For instance, if one believes that recycling is a primary contributor to reducing carbon emissions -a common factual misconception <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Wynes, Zhao &amp; Donner, 2020)</ref> -then behavioural efforts to mitigate will be misplaced.</p><p>There are several possible extensions of this method. One relatively easy idea is to transfer the knowledge gained from developing nudges for a target population this way to another population by using clustering-based methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Deetlefs et al., 2019)</ref>. For instance, we can identify and measure the frequency of various representational clusters in our initial population and how well our various nudges worked for each of them. This can help estimate how effective the nudge might be in another population after only measuring the representational base rates.</p><p>Another extension could be to individually develop nudges for people who are not aligned.</p><p>Although the more generic nudges considered above might work for most of them, people often have immensely variable reasons for diverging from the understanding of the choice architect.</p><p>While this extension can make the method more costly, increasing the resolution of understanding regarding these individual reasons could also increase the efficacy of the nudges (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bryan et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Osman et al., 2020)</ref>. Lastly, misalignment can also be the result of the choice architect's inaccurate representation of the problem situation (cf., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hallsworth, 2023)</ref>. As such, they should keep in mind that they might learn something new from the people they are attempting to nudge NUDGES FOR THINKERS 22 and consider the use of methods that enable them to recognise if their understanding of the decision environment is mistaken.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>Developing nudges through the lens of representational alignment can help with anticipating what kind of nudges could work and for whom, and when and why they might not work or stop working. This is in stark contrast with prevalent approaches which often overlook, or simply assume a high representational alignment, and thus tend to explain discrepancies away by disparaging people's cognitive capacities. An increased focus on balancing the agency between people and choice architects -an acknowledgement that people think -may bring us closer to achieving both theoretical and practical progress.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Illustrative classification of the types of nudges that can be expected to work under varying degrees of representational alignment.</figDesc></figure>
