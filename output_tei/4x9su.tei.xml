				<p>Her research focuses on the acute and long-term effects of substances on cognition and memory. Note: This is a general guide only. Alcohol affects individuals differently depending on factors including age, gender, weight, health, poly-substance use, and tolerance (AGDHAC, 2022b). The cognitive effects of alcohol are especially relevant in forensic contexts. Cognitive impairment is central to complex legal questions about memory (e.g., accuracy, completeness, suggestibility) that may affect jurors&apos; perceptions of intoxication-related testimony.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tipsy, trashed, or totalled? Lay understanding of dose-specific alcohol intoxication and the criminal justice system</head><p>This online survey study explored how Australian laypeople <ref type="bibr">(N = 147)</ref>  Keywords: alcohol; intoxication; cognition; jury decision-making; definition;</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Australia</head><p>Victims and witnesses are regularly under the influence of alcohol when crimes occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kloft et al., 2021)</ref>. The testimony of these victims and/or witnesses is often the only evidence available at trial and is heavily relied upon by jurors <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Schweitzer &amp; Nu√±ez, 2018)</ref>. Jurors must accurately appraise intoxication and its consequences when evaluating such testimony.</p><p>The present study addresses this challenge by exploring the language, standard drinks, blood alcohol concentration (BAC), and symptoms that laypeople use to describe intoxication levels -and the contribution of individual differences to these definitions. Findings may help jurors assess intoxication more accurately based on lay descriptions delivered in trial settings.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alcohol and Cognition</head><p>Acute alcohol intoxication follows the consumption of large amounts of alcohol <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Vonghia et al., 2008)</ref>. It can produce symptoms across domains including "consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behaviour, <ref type="bibr">[and]</ref> impairment" <ref type="bibr">(World Health Organisation, 2022, 6C40.3)</ref>. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> summarises these symptoms with respect to BAC according to the Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care (AGDHAC; 2022b). The applied memory literature suggests that alcohol consumption prior to encoding damages the completeness -but not accuracy -of recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jores et al., 2019</ref>; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Otgaar et al., 2022</ref> for an alternative interpretation). However, dose is an important moderating factor.</p><p>Severe intoxication (BAC &gt; .10) is linked with significantly less complete and less accurate recall compared to lower levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Altman et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jores et al., 2019)</ref>. The volume of alcohol consumed before encoding also influences vulnerability to other memory errors. For example, individuals intoxicated at a low or moderate degree tend not to accept false information when questioned immediately post-event <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Schreiber Compo et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>However, false information acceptance increases at higher doses of alcohol <ref type="bibr">(Oorsouew et al., 2019</ref>).</p><p>The negative effects of alcohol extend to additional forensically relevant cognitive functions including planning, attention, perception, and inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Fillmore, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Vonghia et al., 2008)</ref>. These impairments are particularly relevant in sexual assault cases involving voluntary complainant intoxication, which are common <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abbey et al., 2001)</ref>. Judgements about the complainant's cognitive capacity to consent are crucial in these cases and intoxication-related evidence may inform them <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The reviewed literature illustrates the complicated relationship between alcohol intoxication and cognition. It demonstrates the need to assess laypeople's (1) definitions of alcohol intoxication, and (2) thresholds for alcohol-induced cognitive impairment, to establish whether jurors can accurately engage with this complexity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alcohol Intoxication in the Criminal Justice System</head><p>Criminal justice systems frequently lack consistent, informed guidelines for the management of intoxicated individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Evans et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hagsand et al., 2022)</ref>. For example, Australia lacks a widely used and legislatively endorsed legal definition of intoxication <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. Thorough investigation of the meaning and effects of intoxication is rare at trial, reinforced by an assumption that intoxication is a common knowledge issue. Courts also rarely allow experts to explain alcohol intoxication. Definitions and interpretations instead come from non-specialist parties (e.g., judges, police, lawyers, victims/witnesses; <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>These practices introduce significant potential for the mishandling of intoxication at trial. Jurors often decide if and how a person's intoxication status is relevant to their testimony without precise, evidence-based support <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. The integrity of this exercise relies on the assertion that laypeople are equipped to resolve complicated debates about intoxication and cognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Jurors' Perceptions of Alcohol Intoxication</head><p>However, empirical research points to the opposite conclusion. Jurors cannot accurately determine a person's degree of intoxication. Both amateurs and those with training (e.g., police, bartenders) cannot reliably identify dose-specific alcohol intoxication using behavioural observation <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Monds et al., 2021b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rubenzer, 2011)</ref>. Jurors are also unable to accurately interpret the consequences of a person's intoxication status after-the-fact. Jurors are unaware of the abovementioned dose-dependent relationship between alcohol and completeness/accuracy, leading to an indiscriminate negative view of the credibility of intoxication-related memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Crossland et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Evans &amp; Schreiber Compo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Martin &amp; Monds, 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, jury decision-making in intoxication-related cases is influenced by jurors' personal characteristics. For example, gender, hostile sexism, personal alcohol consumption, and moralistic beliefs about alcohol (e.g., 'people make bad decisions when they drink') predict jurors' decisions in these cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Crossland et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Evans &amp; Schreiber Compo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Martin &amp; Monds, 2023)</ref>. The current study therefore seeks to establish the influence of individual differences on lay intoxication definitions and thresholds for alcohol-induced impairment.</p><p>It is surprising that courts view intoxication detection and interpretation as common knowledge given evidence of skill deficits and the intrusion of individual differences on these assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Quilter and McNamara (2018)</ref> documented a variety of measures used in courtrooms to evaluate intoxication and its effects, including verbal descriptions (e.g., 'under the influence'), drink counts, a score of intoxication out of ten, and judges' interpretations. The current study explores which of these methods are preferred by laypeople when assessing intoxication in a legal context, as well as openness to expert interpretation. Findings may structure future attempts to improve lay understanding of alcohol intoxication by combining favoured evidence formats with expert knowledge.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Language of Intoxication</head><p>While observable and/or objective indicators of intoxication (e.g., symptoms, BAC)</p><p>are important, we must also understand qualitative definitions that reflect intoxication as a subjective experience. Laypeople use an expansive terminology to describe intoxication, with substantial discrimination between moderate and severe doses <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Thickett et al., 2013)</ref>. This vocabulary defines intoxication across domains including perception, behaviour, affect, and cognition, further asserting its descriptive utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Linden-Carmichael et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>However, intoxication language is culturally bound. For example, English, Dutch, and Swedish samples primarily employ behavioural terminology (i.e., describe intoxication via behaviour following alcohol consumption), while Scottish samples prefer language that focuses on the psychological effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cameron et al., 2000</ref> However, a dose-specific summary of lay intoxication language may improve language-based assessments by highlighting their associated quantitative features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Current Study</head><p>The current study aimed to achieve the following in an Australian context:</p><p>1. To produce a systematic lay definitions of intoxication in terms of language, standard drinks, BAC, and symptoms.</p><p>2. To determine the impact of individual differences on these definitions.</p><p>3. To explore perceived thresholds of alcohol-induced impairment in the context of memory and capacity for sexual consent.</p><p>4. To investigate laypeople's preferred forms of intoxication evidence when evaluating a person's intoxication status in a legal context.</p><p>We did not propose hypotheses given the exploratory nature of the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>This study was approved by the University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 2022/361).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were recruited via social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit). The study was described as an investigation of "how Australians perceive and measure alcohol intoxication". An a priori G*Power analysis indicated that N = 146 would be sufficient to detect and effect size of f 2 = .15 with power .95. Participants were required to be at least eighteen; the minimum age for legal alcohol consumption in Australia. They were also required to be Australian citizens or live in Australia and be fluent in English.</p><p>Participants were not reimbursed.</p><p>Participants who responded incorrectly to at least once attention check question (e.g.,</p><p>'Select [5] here') were excluded (n = 39). Two participants were excluded for failing to meet Australian citizenship/residency requirements. The final sample comprised 147 participants (32 males, 111 females, 4 gender diverse). The following ethnic backgrounds were present:</p><p>European/Caucasian (85.0%); Asian (7.5%); Mixed (4.1%), Middle Eastern (2.0%); Hispanic (.7%); Other (.7%). In total, 32.0% of participants had served alcohol at work and 38.8% had received training for this purpose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Design</head><p>The study was a cross-sectional online survey. Key dependent variables included:</p><p>‚Ä¢ The language, number of standard drinks, BAC, and symptoms associated with low, moderate, and severe intoxication.</p><p>‚Ä¢ The intoxication level, number of standard drinks, and BAC at which alcohol is believed to impair memory and capacity for sexual consent.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Preferred forms of evidence when evaluating another's person's intoxication status in a legal setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Measures</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Demographics</head><p>Participants reported their age, gender, ethnicity, first/preferred language, and</p><p>Australian citizenship and residency status.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intoxication Language</head><p>Text-entry items asked for up to three terms describing a person at each of the following intoxication levels: low, moderate, and severe. These items were adapted from Linden-Carmichael et al. <ref type="formula">2021</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard Drinks</head><p>Text-entry items asked for the number of standard drinks an adult male must consume over two hours to achieve low, moderate, and severe intoxication. These items were replicated to assess female consumption. Separate standard drink definitions for males and females were obtained based on gender differences in intoxication following consumption of the same volume of alcohol <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Baraona et al., 2001</ref>). Participants were provided with a definition and examples of an Australian standard drink according to the Alcohol and Drug Foundation (ADF; 2021). For example, an Australian standard drink constitutes 100mL of a 13% alcohol wine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BAC</head><p>Participants reported the BAC they associate with low, moderate, and severe</p><p>intoxication via text-entry items. There were provided with an explanation of BAC and its parameters according to the ADF (2017): This is the legal limit for driving in Australia.'</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Symptoms</head><p>Three multi-answer items explored the symptoms associated with low, moderate, and severe intoxication. Participants selected any of the 21 response options they believed matched each intoxication level. Response options were sourced from <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Vonghia et al. (2008)</ref> and included items such as nausea, slurred speech, and impaired judgement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alcohol-Induced Impairment Thresholds</head><p>Participants indicated when alcohol impairs a person's memory for events in terms of intoxication level (low, moderate, or severe), standard drinks, and BAC. All three items were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Monds et al. (2021a)</ref>. These items were repeated to determine thresholds for impaired capacity for sexual consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intoxication Assessment</head><p>Participates rated the accuracy of their ability to judge their own intoxication level.</p><p>Responses were delivered on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Not accurately at all, 7 = Extremely accurately), where higher scores indicated greater perceived accuracy. This item was replicated to explore perceptions of a typical person's similar assessment ability. Four items asked participants to rate the difficulty of judging another person's degree of intoxication when they are sober and at a low, moderate, and severe level of intoxication. Responses were delivered on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Not difficult at all, 7 = Extremely difficult), where higher scores indicated greater difficulty. For brevity, these six items will not be discussed further in this publication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Intoxication Evidence</head><p>A twelve-item measure assessed preferred evidence formats when judging a person's intoxication status and its relevance to a legal case. Responses were delivered on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = Not helpful at all, 7 = Extremely helpful), where higher scores indicated greater usefulness. The listed evidence was sourced from <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Quilter and McNamara (2018)</ref> and</p><p>included BAC, an expert's interpretation, and a score of intoxication out of ten.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alcohol Stigma</head><p>Three items explored quantification of 'too much alcohol' via intoxication level, standard drinks, and BAC. These items will be explored in a future publication.</p><p>A four-item measure adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Dilevski et al. (2022)</ref> assessed alcohol stigma.</p><p>Responses to each statement (e.g., 'Would you be afraid to talk to someone who consumed alcohol?') were delivered on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Definitely not, 5 = Definitely). Item three was reverse coded so that higher scores indicated more negative attitudes toward alcohol use (i.e., greater stigma).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Personal Alcohol Consumption</head><p>The three-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test -Consumption (AUDIT-C; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Bush et al., 1998)</ref> assessed personal alcohol consumption. Higher total scores indicated greater alcohol consumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alcohol-Related Work and Training</head><p>Participants reported whether had served alcohol at work and if they had received training for this purpose. Those who responded affirmatively to the second item were asked to provide the name of the training and the country it was completed in. These items were adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Monds et al. (2021a)</ref>. Only alcohol-related training was included in relevant analyses given its strong correlation with alcohol-related work, r = .682, p &lt; .001.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Defining Intoxication and Drunkenness</head><p>Text-entry items asked for brief definitions of 'intoxication' and 'drunk'. For brevity, these items will not be discussed further in this publication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The study was completed online via Qualtrics. Participants recorded informed consent and completed the demographic questionnaire. They provided terms to describe low, moderate, and severe intoxication, and reported the standard drinks, BAC, and symptoms they associate with these intoxication levels. Subsequent items explored the thresholds at which memory and capacity for sexual consent are impaired following intoxication.</p><p>Participants rated the accuracy of their own and others' ability to judge intoxication status, and the usefulness of intoxication evidence formats. They quantified 'too much' alcohol and completed the alcohol stigma questionnaire. The study concluded with questions exploring personal alcohol consumption, work/training experiences, and definitions of 'intoxication'</p><p>and 'drunk'.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Pampel, 2000)</ref>. Descriptive analyses investigated preferred forms of intoxication evidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Seventeen participants completed only the initial language-based items. Their data were included in the descriptive analysis of intoxication language (N = 164). All other analyses were performed using the final sample of 147 participants who completed the survey in full. Four participants reported their gender as 'other'. These participants could not be included in analyses related to participant gender based on the low cell count. Their data were retained in all other analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lay Definitions of Dose-Specific Alcohol Intoxication</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linguistic Definitions</head><p>Language data were cleaned for obvious spelling errors and similar terms were collapsed (e.g., 'blackout' and 'black out'). In total, 403 terms were generated to describe the intoxication spectrum. Moderate intoxication was associated with the largest vocabulary (188 terms), followed by severe and low intoxication (172 and 126 terms respectively). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 1</ref> presents the most reported terms for each intoxication level. Seventy-one terms doubled up across intoxication levels, and eight terms were reported across the entire range of intoxication. Psychological: Related to an individual's cognition and emotions; psychological symptoms of intoxication (e.g., 'mellow', 'emotional').</p><p>Slang: A slang term or phrase (e.g., 'tipsy', 'smashed').</p><p>Quantity/Measurement: Related to how much alcohol a person has consumed and/or an assessment relative to sobriety (e.g., 'had a couple', 'not sober').</p><p>Identity: An identity label or description of a 'type' of person (e.g., 'a lightweight', 'party animal').</p><p>Judgement: A positive or negative judgement about the individual based on the observer's experience and/or perception of them (e.g., 'fun', 'worrying').</p><p>Activity: Related to an activity or goal associated with alcohol consumption (e.g., 'ready to party', 'drowning their sorrows'.</p><p>Terms lacking an interpretable meaning in the context of alcohol intoxication (e.g., 'ARDL', 'dinner') were not categorised (n = 22). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2</ref> presents the proportion of terms reported from each category according to intoxication level. Psychological and behavioural/physical terms were most used to describe low intoxication, while behavioural/physical and slang terms most described moderate and severe intoxication. with intoxication level. Participants generally assigned more standard drinks to male alcohol consumption compared to female consumption. Although most definitions were within the five to ten standard drinks range, some participants reported extreme numbers -especially for severe intoxication. The differences between the mean and median standard drinks for low, moderate, and severe male intoxication were -.18, .02, and 1.01 respectively. These differences for low, moderate, and severe female intoxication were .13, -.11, and .31</p><p>respectively.    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard Drinks Definitions</head><p>Age, gender, and personal alcohol consumption significantly predicted the relationship between intoxication level and standard drink definitions.</p><p>An increase in age was associated with a .60% reduction in the odds that severe male intoxication was defined using more standard drinks, and a .40% and .60% decrease in these odds for moderate and severe female intoxication respectively.</p><p>The odds that female participants defined low female intoxication using more standard drinks increased by 12.29% when compared to male participants.</p><p>Finally, greater personal alcohol consumption was associated with the following increases in the odds that participants assigned more standard drinks to male intoxication: 37.71% (low intoxication); 3.67% (moderate intoxication); 3.46% (severe intoxication).</p><p>Similar increases in these odds for female intoxication definitions were observed: 2.33% (low intoxication); 2.43% (moderate intoxication); 2.63% (severe intoxication).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BAC Definitions</head><p>An increase in age was associated with a .10% decrease in the odds that participants used higher BACs to define low intoxication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Differences and Alcohol-Induced Impairment Thresholds</head><p>On average, participants believed alcohol begins to impair memory at a moderate level of intoxication, 6.01 standard drinks, or a BAC of .25. The average threshold for capacity to consent to sexual activity was a moderate level of intoxication, 5.50 standard drinks, or a BAC of .22.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Thresholds for Impaired Memory</head><p>Age, personal alcohol consumption, and alcohol-related training significantly predicted memory impairment thresholds <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">(Table 3</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preferred Forms of Intoxication Evidence</head><p>Participants rated the usefulness of intoxication evidence formats (e.g., cognitive symptoms, BAC) when evaluating a person's intoxication status and its relevance to a legal case. <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref> presents means and standard deviations of these ratings, plus the proportion of participants who considered each format to be at least moderately helpful.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lay Definitions of Dose-Specific Alcohol Intoxication</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Linguistic Definitions</head><p>Participants used an extensive vocabulary across a variety of domains (e.g., symptoms, slang terminology) to describe the intoxication spectrum. Low intoxication was most described using psychological terms, while moderate and severe intoxication were most frequently labelling using physical/behavioural terms. This finding aligns with the pattern of symptoms observed with increasing intoxication, as psychological effects tend to emerge first (AGDHAC, 2022b). Intoxication language therefore may be informed by the salience of selfexperienced symptoms at each dose.</p><p>Language variation across intoxication levels implies a degree of dose specificity in intoxication terminology. Descriptive language is frequently used to articulate intoxication in Australian courts, often with little scrutiny of what this language represents <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. Linking language to dose may improve the efficacy of this imprecise tool.</p><p>However, the utility of language remains restricted as many terms were duplicated across levels (e.g., 'drunk' was the most common descriptor of both moderate and severe intoxication). Language-based assessments must be supplemented using other measures of intoxication. Additionally, legal actors' (e.g., witnesses, victims, police, lawyers) language should be directly clarified to achieve accuracy.</p><p>Our findings also reinforce the need to engage with intoxication language through a culture-specific lens. Higher levels of intoxication were associated with larger vocabularies, while an American study documented the inverse <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Linden-Carmichael et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, popular Australian slang terms (e.g., 'smashed', 'pissed') were uncommon in the American sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Linden-Carmichael et al., 2020)</ref>. Therefore, courts should contextualise intoxication based on the culture of those delivering and interpreting intoxication language.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Standard Drink Definitions</head><p>Standard drink definitions increased with intoxication level. Definitions describing male consumption were greater than those describing female consumption, reflecting a general understand of gender differences in intoxication following comparable alcohol consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Baraona et al., 2001</ref>). <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Quilter and McNamara (2018)</ref> highlighted Australian courts' frequent use of 'drink counts' to establish a person's intoxication status during an event. These counts typically reference the type of alcohol consumed and its container (e.g., 'two casks of white wine') rather than standard drinks <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">p. 179)</ref>. The researchers argue that these 'drink counts' likely offer little more than a "crude indicator of the volume of alcohol consumed" despite the appearance of specificity <ref type="bibr">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018, p. 180)</ref>.</p><p>Courts may achieve more precision by estimating standard drink counts using evidence-based conversion guides (e.g., AGDHAC, 2020). However, the influence of factors such as drinking period, age, gender, size, tolerance, and poly-substance use will complicate discussions (AGDHAC, 2022b). Nonetheless, evaluating intoxication using standard units offers a promising strategy to improve current practices characterised by imprecision <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. Quantification via standard drinks may offer a close estimation of intoxication than unsystematic 'drink counts' if jurors, judges, and other legal actors are properly informed about this metric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BAC Definitions</head><p>BAC definitions also increased with intoxication level. The average BAC associated with low intoxication (.07) reflected awareness that Australian driving laws define intoxication as BAC ‚â• .05 (AGDHAC, 2022a). However, participants struggled with BAC beyond this benchmark as definitions were affected by extreme values. For example, the average BAC associated with severe intoxication (.32) is linked to coma and death <ref type="bibr">(AGDHAC, 2022b)</ref>. This may be related to (1) peoples' tendency to poorly estimate BAC, and (2) the rarity of BAC calculation in everyday life <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Aston &amp; Liguori, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rubenzer, 2011</ref>).</p><p>BAC is therefore not a foolproof solution to issues associated with subjective metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rubenzer, 2011)</ref>. BAC is currently inadmissible outside driving-related cases in Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. Moreover, compulsory testing of victims and witnesses may convey harmful victim blaming or discourage cooperation. It is also difficult to estimate BAC using a delayed reading. Finally, judges and jurors prefer 'lay' or observable intoxication evidence, even when a BAC result obtained immediately post-event is available <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Despite these challenges, we argue that BAC evidence belongs in the courtroom when available and properly contextualised. Interpretation of BAC information can improve with training, suggesting education can resolve the observed issues with comprehension <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Aston &amp; Liguori, 2013)</ref>. Nonetheless, we propose standard drinks are the most promising objective measure of intoxication. They are more familiar and are easier to report and understand than BAC, and therefore better align with legal actors' preference for simple intoxication evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Symptom Definitions</head><p>Impairment-based symptoms (e.g., impaired judgement) increased with intoxication level, while positive symptoms (e.g., relaxation) decreased. Fewer symptoms were associated with low intoxication compared to moderate and severe intoxication. These findings reflect an understanding that the negative effects of alcohol increase with dose <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Dry et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Quilter and McNamara (2018)</ref> documented a strong reliance on visual cues in Australian courts, highlighting an assumption that intoxication can be reliably observed.</p><p>However, police, bartenders, and laypeople cannot consistently identify a person's intoxication using symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rubenzer, 2011)</ref>. Additionally, no symptom has been linked to a specific degree of intoxication without substantial variation between individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rubenzer, 2011)</ref>. Symptoms also depend on whether intoxication is rising or falling and can be caused by other substances (e.g., benzodiazepines) or health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Kloft et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Martin et al., 1993)</ref>.</p><p>However, courtroom assessments of alcohol intoxication should not exclude symptom-based evidence, especially given the preference for this information <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. How an individual felt while intoxicated may be the only information available in cases where the person cannot remember how much alcohol they consumed and were not breathalysed. Instead -like each of the strategies discussed above -courts should cautiously evaluate symptom-based evidence when determining intoxication and its consequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Individual Differences and Lay Intoxication Definitions</head><p>Individual differences influenced many of the lay definitions discussed above, suggesting that personal experience anchors conceptions of intoxication. Older participants assigned fewer standard drinks to severe male intoxication, and moderate and severe female intoxication. Alternatively, participants who habitually consumed more alcohol defined moderate and severe intoxication with more standard drinks across male and female targets.</p><p>Both effects may be informed by tolerance: sensitivity to alcohol generally increases with age and decreases with persistent alcohol use <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Elvig et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Meier &amp; Seitz, 2008</ref>).</p><p>Individual differences exerted far less influence over BAC definitions. This may be a product of the misunderstanding of BAC discussed above. Future research should re-examine these relationships following BAC education.</p><p>Australian courts regularly depend on laypeople to evaluate an individual's intoxication status and its legal consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. This process may amplify the role of individual differences and create strategic opportunities for lawyers:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Jurors whose individual difference factors imply a favourable interpretation of intoxication evidence can be privileged during voir dire.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Awareness of victims'/witness' individual difference factors can be used to enhance their delivery of intoxication evidence at trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Alcohol-Induced Impairment Thresholds</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Memory</head><p>Participants believed alcohol impairs memory at a moderate level of alcohol intoxication, 6.01 standard drinks, or a BAC of .25. Age and personal alcohol consumption informed standard drink thresholds, likely driven by the same tolerance effects discussed above <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Elvig et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Meier &amp; Seitz, 2008)</ref>. Participants with alcohol-related training (e.g., Responsible Service of Alcohol accreditation) labelled the threshold for impaired memory using higher BACs. This judgement aligns with empirical literature, suggesting that education and practice interacting with intoxicating people improves understanding of BAC and memory impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Jores et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Capacity for Sexual Consent</head><p>Participants reported the threshold for impaired capacity for sexual consent as a moderate level of intoxication, 5.50 standard drinks, or a BAC of .22. Greater alcohol stigma predicted lower impairment thresholds when using descriptive labels (i.e., low, moderate, or severe). The belief that alcohol is 'bad' may encourage people to view alcohol as more harmful in sexual situations, lowering the perceived level of intoxication required to damage a person's capacity for consent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Impairment Thresholds in the Courtroom</head><p>Questions about impairment are central to legal proceedings and may inform how intoxication evidence is presented and interpreted <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. For example, impairment thresholds may determine whether a person's testimony, line-up identification, or sexual assault claim is viewed as credible <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Evans &amp; Schreiber Compo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lynch et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Martin &amp; Monds, 2023)</ref>. Courts should acknowledge the potential contribution of individual differences and minimise erroneous decision-making by providing context-specific, evidence-based information about alcohol and impairment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preferred Forms of Intoxication Evidence</head><p>Participants viewed symptom-based evidence as most helpful when evaluating a person's intoxication status and its legal relevance, while a judge's interpretation was seen as least helpful. The preference for symptom information aligns with common questions in intoxication-related trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. For example:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Has alcohol damaged the credibility of testimony?</p><p>‚Ä¢ Could an intoxicated complainant consent to sexual activity?</p><p>‚Ä¢ How did an intoxicated person behave before, during, and after the event in question?</p><p>Participants welcomed expert interpretation, reinforcing the conclusion that current reluctance to utilise expert intoxication evidence is unfounded <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, judges' interpretations were least valued. This contradicts current practice: judges tend to believe they can accurately articulate and interpret intoxication despite lacking expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. Targeted, serviceable education for judges may address this issue.</p><p>These findings reflect preferences rather than use. The evidence formats perceived as most helpful on paper may diverge from those preferred at trial. For example, judges'</p><p>interpretations may become more convincing when jurors are relying on judges to help them navigate real legal complexities <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cordell &amp; Keller, 1993)</ref>. Moreover, preferred formats may differ from those that actually help laypeople to make informed decisions. Nonetheless, these results offer valuable preliminary insights into the most compelling forms of intoxication evidence and may benefit future education strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations and Future Directions</head><p>Not every person will define intoxication in the same way. Australian courts are already hampered by a vague approach to intoxication, so it would be imprudent to recommend a one-size-fits-all application of our findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Quilter &amp; McNamara, 2018)</ref>. The current study also remained abstract rather than referencing a specific case. Case details (e.g., crime type) can affect how people evaluate an individual's intoxication status and their subsequent decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bieneck &amp; Krah√©, 2011)</ref>. Additionally, target factors that affect intoxication (e.g., drinking period, size, tolerance) were not provided (AGDHAC, 2022b).</p><p>These qualifications frame our findings as consensus-based guidelines for the articulation and interpretation of intoxication, rather than rigid standards. Context, specificity, and expert scientific/medical guidance are essential for accurate engagement with intoxication in the courtroom.</p><p>The current study explored lay Australian understanding of alcohol intoxication.</p><p>Previous research suggests that jurors struggle to accurately employ intoxication information when decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Crossland et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Evans &amp; Schreiber Compo, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Martin &amp; Monds, 2023)</ref>. Future research should explore how the observed lay intoxication definitions shape decision-making in trial scenarios and whether lay understanding can be improved.</p><p>Participants' receptivity to expert evidence is promising. However, further research is required to establish the most effective modes of intoxication evidence and education, their robustness across cases, and whether they differ from the preferences expressed in the current study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>The current study demonstrated that laypeople use a range of measures to define alcohol at a dose-specific level. The relationships between standard drinks, symptoms, and alcohol intoxication were better understood than the link between intoxication and BAC. Lay definitions were influenced by age, personal alcohol consumption, and gender. Participants also possessed thresholds for alcohol-impaired memory and capacity for consent. Age, personal alcohol consumption, alcohol-related training, and alcohol stigma informed these thresholds. Awareness of the link between these individual differences and conceptions of intoxication may benefit lawyers during victim/witness preparation, jury selection, and oral argument.</p><p>Participants welcomed many forms of intoxication evidence, especially symptombased information, and expert interpretation. These results reflect an awareness that alcohol intoxication is complex and multi-factorial <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rubenzer et al., 2011)</ref>. No single evidence format is free from limitations or will be available in every case. Therefore, courts should strive for accuracy by (1) using as many information sources as possible, and (2) utilising evidence-based expert guidance, to corroborate assessments of intoxication and its legal consequences.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>define alcohol intoxication using language, standard drinks, blood alcohol concentration (BAC), and symptoms. Participants used an extensive vocabulary to describe intoxication and better understood intoxication in terms of standard drinks and symptoms compared to BAC.

Participants rated symptom-based evidence as most useful when evaluating a person's intoxication status in a legal setting and welcomed expert evidence.
