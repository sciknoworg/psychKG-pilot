			<abstract>
				<p>As humans, we often repeat previously rewarded actions without thinking, but we also possess the ability to plan ahead and simulate actions based on an internal model of the environment. These two types of control are commonly conceptualised as model-free versus model-based control. While there is a body of research on interindividual differences in using either strategy, we aimed to test whether people can also learn to regulate which strategy to use based on environmental demand. We used a two-stage decision-making task in which two different firststage states that repeated or alternated between trials shared a deterministic transition structure where actions led to the same second-stage states with drifting reward options. We manipulated how often participants (n = 140) were exposed to alternations versus repetitions between the different first-stage states. When these states frequently repeat, there is a reduced need to consult the transition structure as it pays off to adopt model-free control and simply retake previously rewarded actions. Conversely, when first-stage states frequently alternate, it is more beneficial to adopt model-based control, considering the transition structure and generalising reward outcomes between them. In line with our hypothesis, we show that participants exposed to more first-stage state alternations were also more model-based in a later test phase compared to participants exposed to more first-stage state repetitions. These findings suggest that people learn to arbitrate between different reinforcement-learning strategies consistent with a costbenefit analysis sensitive to environmental demands.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>When an action leads to a desired outcome, we tend to repeat it almost automatically, yet we can quickly adapt our behaviour to changing circumstances when needed. For example, we can almost blindly take the same route to work daily but also plan a detour if a traffic jam is announced. The distinction between model-free and model-based reinforcement learning provides a mathematical formalisation of these adaptive features of human behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Daw et al., 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Daw et al., , 2011</ref>. While model-free choices rely on the reward history of previous actions, directly reinforcing those leading to success, model-based control guides behaviour by planning over an internal causal model of the environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dolan &amp; Dayan, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Doll et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gläscher et al., 2010)</ref>. These strategies trade off against each other, as model-free control is more efficient and cognitively cheap, and model-based control is more flexible but computationally more demanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kool et al., 2017;</ref>. However, little is known about how people learn to navigate this trade-off based on environmental demands. Therefore, inspired by previous theories and studies on the learning of cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abrahamse et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Braem &amp; Egner, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Doebel, 2020)</ref>, we aimed to test whether people can dynamically learn to adjust their reliance on model-based versus model-free control depending on the environment-specific demands and benefits of using these different strategies.</p><p>Previous findings have shown that the regulation of model-based and model-free control can be driven, among others by cognitive load <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gershman et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Otto, Gershman, et al., 2013)</ref>, opportunity costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Pezzulo et al., 2013)</ref>, time <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Keramati et al., 2011)</ref>, stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Otto, Raio, et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Radenbach et al., 2015)</ref> or amplification of outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kool et al., 2017)</ref>. In this study, we aimed to test whether people can also learn the value of modelbased versus model-free control from more subtle contingencies in the environment that make one or the other strategy more beneficial. To test this question, we implemented a simple manipulation in the deterministic two-step task developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kool et al. (2017)</ref>. On each trial of this task, participants start in one of two first-stage states. Each of these states is associated with a unique pair of spaceships. For each of these two pairs, the two spaceships deterministically lead to one of two planets, each associated with an alien that provides rewards that drift slowly over time (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1)</ref>. In our version of this task, we varied levels of environmental demand by changing the frequency of repeating versus alternating firststage states (i.e., the initial spaceship pairs to choose from). We reasoned that if spaceship pairs frequently alternate, it is worth mobilising cognitive resources to update the current reward values of each planet associated with the spaceships in each pair (i.e., to be more model-based). However, if spaceship pairs frequently repeat, generalising between pairs has less added benefit, and simply repeating previously rewarded actions (i.e., to act more modelfree) may be sufficient. Therefore, we predicted that people who encounter more alternations between the first-stage states would learn to be more model-based, while those subjected to more first-stage state repetitions may learn to be more model-free.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Participants</head><p>We recruited 144 participants from the University's recruitment platform, who participated for course credit. Of these, four were excluded based on more than 40 missing responses. In the group rewarded more on first-stage repetitions (n=69), there were 47 women, 20 men and one non-binary participant (mean age = 19.29, SD = 2.88, eight lefthanded). In the group rewarded more on first-stage alternations (n=71), there were 57 women and 14 men (mean age = 18.63, SD=1.02, five left or ambidexter). For one participant in the repetition group, demographic data was not saved. Participants were not given bonus payments based on performance, but they were told that the goal of the experiment was to collect as many points as possible.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Materials and procedure</head><p>The experiment was programmed in jsPsych (de Leeuw, 2015), retrieved and adapted from Kool and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kool et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kool et al., , 2017</ref>, and run online. In each trial, participants were presented with one of two screens (first-stage states), each containing two spaceships (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). Participants had to choose between these spaceships, which were presented side-byside using the "F" and "J" keys on the keyboard within 1,500ms. This choice determined which of two planets (second-stage states), a red or a purple one, would then be visited. Importantly, the choices in each first-stage state afforded the opportunity of transitioning to either plane: one ship always led to the purple planet and the other to the red planet. In this second-stage state, participants encountered a single alien that would give the rewards in the form of "space treasure" after a button press. The rewards provided by the aliens were determined according to independent and slowly drifting reward distributions (Gaussian random walk with rewards varying between 0 and 9 (σ = 2)).</p><p>Before starting the main experiment, participants underwent extensive training to learn the reward manipulation and transition structure, i.e., which spaceship leads to which planet, followed by 25 complete practice rounds. They were instructed that the goal was to collect as many points as possible throughout the main experiment. In the first half of the main experiment (125 trials, to have sufficient trials in the subsequent test phase, based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kool et al., 2016)</ref>, participants in the first-stage "repetition" group were presented with 80% repetitions of first-stage states, i.e., they encountered the same spaceship pairs in two subsequent trials.</p><p>Conversely, participants in the first-stage "alternation" group encountered first-stage alternations 80% of the time. In both groups, we ensured participants saw both stages 50% of the time. In the second half, both groups underwent another trials, in which they saw 50% first-stage repetitions or alternations respectively. At no point in the experiment were participants instructed on the frequency manipulation.</p><p>Because the choices between spaceships are equivalent between the first-stage states, this task allows us to distinguish between model-based and model-free strategies. This is possible because only the model-based system transfers experiences learned in one starting state to the other starting state. For a model-based agent, each second-stage outcome affects subsequent first-stage preferences equivalently, i.e., independent of whether the next trial starts with the same pair of spaceships as on the previous trials. This is because model-based agents plan towards the second-stage goals. In contrast, a pure model-free strategy does not transfer experiences between first-stage states since they only learn action-reward associations <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Doll et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Simulating the environment-specific marginal gains of using model-based control</head><p>Before running the main analyses on participants' performance, we ran simulations to confirm whether adopting a model-free strategy effectively paid off more when first-stage states repeat vs alternate frequently (in terms of total reward earned). To this end, we simulated data from 125 trials for 500 agents per reward group based on 500 plausible parameter combinations. As expected, our simulated data showed a significant correlation between the model-based weighting parameter and the total rewards earned in the group encountering more first-stage alternations (Pearson's r(498)= 0.168, p &lt; 0.001), indicating that it paid off to be model-based in this group in terms of total rewards earned. However, this correlation was not observed in the group encountering more first-stage repetitions (Pearson's r(498)= 0.036, p &lt; 0.425). A Fisher's z-test indicated a significant difference between these two correlations, p = .017, suggesting there was a reduced need to be model-based in this group, and a cheaper model-free strategy was sufficient regarding total pay-off.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Comparing model-based control in high-versus low-alternation environments</head><p>We restrict our analyses to the test phase of the experiment for two reasons. First, both groups performed the same task in this phase but not in the inducer phase. Second, our hypothesis only pertained to the test phase.</p><p>As expected, our results revealed that people in the group encountering more firststage alternations showed increased model-based control compared to people in the group encountering more first-stage repetitions (t(128.97) = -2.374, p &lt; .01; one-sided, Welch modification to degrees of freedom used due to inequality of variances). Moreover, they were less persistent in their choices, as indicated by the choice stickiness parameter (t(138) = 2.013, p = .046; see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Differences in choice behaviour in high-versus low-alternation environments</head><p>To get a behavioural estimate of whether participants in the group encountering more repetitions in the inducer phase showed more model-based behaviour in the test phase, we also ran a logistic mixed effects model in brms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bürkner, 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bürkner, , 2018</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bürkner, , 2021</ref>. This model predicted whether participants stayed with or switched the second-stage state from the previous trial as a function of the sign of the second reward prediction error (PE) on the last trial (retrieved from the computational model), first-stage state sequence (repetition or alternation) and group (in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kool et al., 2017)</ref>. In logistic models for this task, a main effect of previous PE reflects model-based control (because it reflects a tendency to visit previously rewarded second-stage state regardless of starting state), whereas an interaction between previous PE and first-stage state reflects model-free control (because the effect of previous outcome depends on whether the same first-stage state is encountered).</p><p>We predicted that we would observe an interaction between group, the sign of the previous PE and the first-stage sequence. Specifically, we expected that participants in the group encountering more first-stage alternations would show more stay (leave) behaviour following positive (negative) prediction errors on both repetition and alternation trials (where one has to generalise across stages, i.e., be model-based), whereas participants in the group encountering more first stage repetitions to show more stay (leave) behaviour following positive (negative) PE, but only on repetition trials (where no generalisation is necessary). As expected, we found main effects of previous PE (b=-0.406, 95% CI [-0.519, -0.403]), with participants being more likely to stay following a positive PE, and of transition (b=0.148, 95% CI [0.098, 0.197]), with participants being overall more likely to choose the same state again when they repeated. We also saw an interaction between the sign of the previous PE and transition .039]), with participants being more likely to stay following a positive PE on repetition as compared to alternation trials. This interaction was not further modulated by group (b=-0.004, 95% CI [-0.046, 0.035]) (see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). We also did not see an interaction between the sign of the previous PE and group (b=0.023, 95% CI [-0.033, 0.083]), though the alternation group showed numerically less stay behaviour following negative prediction errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The goal of this project was to investigate whether people can learn to arbitrate adaptively between two reinforcement-learning strategies, i.e., model-free and model-based control, depending on features of the environment. While others have shown that people can learn to arbitrate between both strategies based on explicit incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kool et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Patzelt et al., 2019)</ref>, we showed that they can also learn to regulate these control modes based on more subtle environmental features. Specifically, we manipulated how frequently participants encountered first-stage alternations or repetitions in the two-step task, thereby influencing which strategy is more effective in terms of a cost-benefit trade-off <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kool et al., 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kool et al., , 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Otto &amp; Daw, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Shenhav et al., 2013)</ref>. As model-based control pays off more when the first-stage states alternate frequently due to having to update values between the two spaceship pairs, we expected and found that participants eventually learned to act more model-based in a subsequent, separate test phase. Our finding provides important evidence for the ability of humans to learn adaptive control settings over time, without explicit instructions or task cues, in line with an emerging learning perspective on cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abrahamse et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Braem et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Held et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Simoens et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Xu et al., 2024)</ref>. The fact that such learning translates to reinforcement learning further hints at a general self-regulatory mechanism that can explain adaptive parameter settings without necessitating a homunculus or "loan of intelligence" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Boureau et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dennett, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>Our findings may further have clinical implications. Specifically, previous research has found interesting interindividual differences in applying either strategy, highlighting an important transdiagnostic mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gillan et al., 2016)</ref>. Extending these findings, others have pointed at interindividual differences in regulating both strategies based on reward incentives that participants were explicitly told to consider <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Patzelt et al., 2019)</ref>. In contrast, our manipulation relied on the regulation of meta-control based on learned contingencies with environmental demands. As also argued for other disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Geurts et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Van Eylen et al., 2011)</ref>, the use of explicit task instructions or manipulations can often lead to a failure to detect underlying cognitive impairments in clinical disorders because (difficulties with) our daily activities or everyday life often come without clear instructions on how to act. We, therefore, believe it would be interesting to adapt our manipulation to a within-subject design and study whether (mal)adaptive regulation of reinforcement strategies based on environmental demands could be a clinical marker. Similarly, it would be interesting to study this in development, meaningfully extending findings by <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Smid et al. (2023)</ref> who found less arbitration between both strategies in children based on explicit stake cues.</p><p>One limitation of our work concerns the current criticisms of the strict distinction between model-based and model-free control. For instance, it has been argued that this dichotomy is oversimplifying more complex decision-making structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Collins &amp; Cockburn, 2020)</ref>, that there is no sharply defined line separating them <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Miller et al., 2019)</ref>, or that the model-free system is hierarchically governed rather than flat as modelled in this paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dezfouli et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dezfouli &amp; Balleine, 2012</ref>. Another criticism states that seemingly model-free behaviour in humans may arise simply from inaccurate models rather than a model-free process <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Feher Da Silva &amp; Hare, 2020)</ref>. We believe these criticisms do not diminish the value of our findings. Our predictions rely on the assumed computational cost of model-based control and its increased usefulness in an environment with more first-state alternations. Because our main interest was to document how people learn to arbitrate the relative costs and benefits of different decision strategies (see also <ref type="bibr">Otto et al., 2022)</ref>, showing a similar learned arbitration between this type of model-based control and, for instance, a computationally efficient but incorrect model (a wrong model would take up resources as well, see also, Morris &amp; Cushman, 2019) should thus be equally informative.</p><p>In sum, our findings suggest that people can learn to adaptively regulate their reliance on model-based versus model-free control depending on environmental demands. Namely, individuals showed changes in control strategies in response to the frequency of first-stage alternations, favouring model-based control when alternations were frequent and defaulting to the less costly model-free approach when first-stage repetitions dominated. Future research exploring individual differences in model-based versus model-free control could further elucidate how this learning of adaptive control processes may vary across different (sub)clinical populations or stages of development.</p><p>Data availability: All data is available at https://osf.io/6gy9c/?view_only=994e80d9931448dea371782c5443a0af. </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>the learning rate (the degree to which new information is integrated into the decision process).
