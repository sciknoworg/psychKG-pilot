				<p>Cyber operations are increasingly automated processes that can occur at computational speed with the intent of reducing, or denying time for good decision making or time to ground communication between human agents. There is a lack of performance measures and metrics in cyber operation settings. One potential setting describing human performance could be emotional stability under stress. Measures of higher individual affective variability indicate more emotional adaptability and allows for measuring individuals as dynamic systems. Previous research in other security-sensitive high-stake situations has shown that individuals with less emotional adaptability display maladaptive behaviors while individuals with more emotional adaptability can adapt more efficiently to changing situations, show more confidence in their own abilities and skills, and display better performance. We hypothesized that measurements of affective variability during a cyber defense exercise will be associated with team workload demands. Data was collected from 13 cadets during the Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy&apos;s annual Cyber Defense Exercise. Three indicators of individual affective variability were measured daily with the Self-Assessment Manikin and compared to scores on the Team Workload Questionnaire. We found that affective variability was negatively associated with team workload demands. Participants with higher affective variability, as measured by the Self-Assessment Manikin, will impose less workload demands on the team, which can lead to better outcomes. This is the first study to assess how individual emotional adaptability affects team dynamics in a cyber defense setting. Future research should include variable measurements as they may have better explanatory power for performance measurements.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Cyber operations are increasingly automated processes that can occur at computational speed with the intent of reducing, or denying time for good decision making or time to ground communication between human agents. One of the most persistent issues in studying cyber defense individuals and teams is that there is a general lack of performance metrics and measures in such a setting. In recent years, there has been an increase in research evaluating the performance of cyber defenders in teams, but few studies have looked at individual aspects that may influence team performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Cyber operations are high-stake situations and COs are under heavy cognitive load for prolonged periods of time. Security Operations Centers (SOCs) consist of teams that work around the clock to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats and incidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. SOC teams monitor large and continuous streams of network data to detect potential threats. Operative cyber personnel (Cyber Operators; COs) make up the technical staff of SOC teams and are responsible for threat detection, data analysis, digital forensics, network security and cyber intelligence, as well as communicating with SOC decision-makers and clients. Thus, the task-environment that COs are working within spans the cyber, physical, and social domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and creates a complex socio-technical system (STS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> where humans and machines interact to maintain cyber resilience in civil and military sectors.</p><p>The cognitive challenges SOC teams face while operating in a STS span a wide range of domains from complex problem-solving, to asset prioritization and protection, intra-and inter-team communication, decision-making based on high uncertainty, leadership efficiency, collaboration and coordination efficiency, constant acquisition of technical and threat competence, updating situational awareness, risk management, problem detection, and information seeking, and more <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Developing applicable solutions to these challenges such that SOC team performance can be improved will require scientific approaches at both the team- <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and individual level <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>Communication problems are listed as one of the main challenges facing SOC teams <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> but individual factors that affect communication and coordination in cyber teams are poorly understood. Due to the cognitive load associated with cyber operations, the ability to adaptively regulate stress and emotions may serve as relevant individual level indicators of performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">The relationship between affective states and adaptive performance</head><p>Higher affective variability (RMSSD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> is defined as "relatively short-term changes that are construed as more or less reversible and that occur more rapidly" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Indices of affective variability allows for the measurement of individuals as dynamic systems where neither trait nor state measurements are able to access changes during specific situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and has been shown to predict higher maladaptive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and higher variability in perceived control predicted earlier mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Interpreting stress reactions and tension has effects on perceiving one's state and adaptation ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Research has shown that positive moods improved confidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, while despondent moods decreased feelings of self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Research on affective states and their influence on behaviors in cyber security is scarce. Research in other domains has shown that affective states can influence performance <ref type="bibr">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18]</ref> and this could lead to targeted interventions to help learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Situational stressors, whether environmental, emotional, or cognitive, increase physiological arousal to prepare the individual to adapt to the environment, and all stressor categories essentially work on the same biological systems to activate the individual for action. Theories for optimal arousal suggest that there is an individual sweet spot for every person where arousal levels matched to a task maximizes performance, and arousal levels below or above this sweet spot is an impediment to performance (Yerkes-Dodson law <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20]</ref>). Arousal levels change with shifts in attention but are dependent on the emotional valence of stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> and optimal attention-allocation for task-related performance appears to be associated with proxies for regulation of arousal that are also associated with affective variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>. This suggests that the neural components responsible for regulating affective states are intertwined with performance-related factors associated with attention and arousal. Cognitive-and behavioral neuroscience approaches to problems facing the field of cybersecurity are currently under-explored. To fully appreciate why the regulation of affective states can be important for cyber team performance, it is necessary to first understand the central and peripheral psychophysiological correlates of affective regulation, communication and coordination, and complex problem solving, and how these abilities rely on the same neural systems. Thus, in the three following sections we will detail the underlying neural components of these abilities and how they are related.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">Neural correlates of affective control and variability and relationships with regulation of physiological arousal</head><p>The primary neural structure that is responsible for an individual's ability to regulate their own affective states is the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC exerts top-down control on emotional states in part via a prefrontal sub-structure called the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) which is involved in regulating both neutral and negative emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>. In addition to affective regulation, the DLPFC also plays an important role in other executive functions such as planning and attention control. During conscious regulation of one's own affective states, activity in the DLPFC increases while activity in the Amygdala, a structure associated with arousal and negative affect, decreases along with selfreports of negative affect <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24]</ref>. For an individual to consciously regulate their own affective states, the DLPFC must first be engaged to allocate attention to the individual's emotional state then decide how to regulate it. The role of the DLPFC in affective regulation is lateralized, with the left DLPFC (lDLPFC) being involved in affective regulation while increased right DLPFC (rDLPFC) activity is associated with affective dysregulation and deficits in emotional attention regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26]</ref>. The PFC receives signals about emotional-and physiological arousal through a process called interoception (sensing the activity in your organs; gut feelings) <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref> and the PFC integrates this information when deciding how to regulate affective states.</p><p>The DLPFC regulates physiological-and emotional arousal in part by (1) increasing activity in the vagal branch of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), and (2) inhibiting activity in the sympathetic branch of the ANS <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. Both branches of the ANS innervate all the organs of the body, and this DLPFC-to-ANS pathway of stimulation will lead to reduced arousal, characterized by decreased activity in organs such as the heart and lower heart rate. As opposed to the constant and high heart rate resulting from sympathetic input to the heart, the increased DLPFC modulated vagal input to the heart causes the length and variations in the intervals between each heart beat to increase, increasing heart rate variability (HRV). This mechanism is what allows the DLPFC to aid the individual in adapting their emotional and stress responses to situations with varying levels of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31]</ref>. Higher vagally mediated HRV (vmHRV) reflects higher vagal input to the heart at rest, lower heart rate, and higher affective variability, while lower vmHRV reflects lower vagal input to the heart at rest, higher heart rate, and lower affective variability. Higher affective variability means higher regulatory range thus higher capacity for adaptive emotional responding, while lower affective variability means lower regulatory range thus lower capacity for adaptive emotional responding.</p><p>Evidence for top-down control of the PFC on stress-and emotional arousal was found in a study where transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the left DLPFC reduced was associated with increased vmHRV, higher mood scores, and reduced levels of cortisol, the latter being a hormonal biomarker of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>. Further evidence for the coupling of cognitive function, affective variability, and physiological adaptive ability was demonstrated in a study showing that cognitive flexibility along with higher vmHRV predicted ability to regulate arousal during prolonged stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32]</ref>. As COs operating in teams can be exposed to heavy stress and cognitive load for long periods of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33]</ref> it suggests that affective regulation capacity can be vital to cyber team performance. Furthermore, affective regulation ability is related to the degree individuals can emotionally detach from work-related stress, with lower affective regulation ability being associated with lower ability to detach, indicated by higher levels of workrelated perseverative cognitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>. The temporal intensity of affective states may increase allocation of attentional resources to attentional states resulting in perseverative cognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>. Given the tendency for SOC team members to work 12-hour shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the ability to detach from work may be important to reduce work-stress load on COs, although our previous research show that indicators of affective intensity are not related to perseverative cognitions in cyber officer cadets <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>. This may suggest that the selection process for COs result in cognitive and emotional profiles that differ from the general population, which in turn could downplay the effect of affective variability on cyber team dynamics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Neural correlates of affective variability and control overlaps with neural correlates of social coherence, coordination, and communication</head><p>vmHRV and its relation to affective regulation is suggested to be important for interpersonal functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref> arguing for its relevance in collaborative settings such as cybersecurity. Studies on socio-emotional problems in children suggest that they co-occur with communication problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref> and continuous measures of vmHRV suggest that reduced affective and arousal regulation is associated with communication problems in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>. Moreover, vmHRV is associated with proxies of social cognitions. This includes personal indicators of ability to adapt to the environment in the face of adverse conditions such as feelings of trust and social relatedness among adolescents and young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref> as well as social orientation values in male adults such as preference for cooperation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>. Being able to regulate one's own affective states during social interactions may result in experiencing social interactions as low-stress, thus, for individuals working in high-stress social settings and in teams, affective regulatory capacity could possibly aid cooperation by facilitating pro-social cognitions.</p><p>A wide range of data from various settings suggest that for humans to coordinate and communicate successfully in dyads and in groups, it requires the synchronization of various physiological systems in both the central and peripheral nervous system <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51]</ref>. One simple example of how disruptive asynchrony can be to communication is if you are trying to maintain a conversation with someone who is shouting when you are talking calmly or if they are not walking at your pace. The same is true for affective states and physiological arousal, indicated by studies assessing vmHRV synchrony with respect to social coherence and communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48]</ref>. Coordinating and communicating with an individual that is in a different and perhaps unpredictable affective state compared to one's own can be challenging during exposure to prolonged stressors.</p><p>Communication is a complex social interaction, with contextually guided predictions and mental models of speakers and listeners contributing to message comprehension as much as the actual words that are shared. In studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging, spatial and temporal neural coupling (brain-to-brain synchrony) between speaker and listener is important for the success of communication with respect to whether the listener comprehends what the speaker is trying to convey <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51]</ref>. Both mirroring and predictive synchronous activity was observed in the listener with respect to the brain activity of the speaker, with greater neural coupling being related to greater understanding of the conveyed message. In naturalistic studies of groups of high-school students, attentional effort appears to be a determinant of brain-to-brain synchrony <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>. A recent review found that optimizing attentional efforts for task-related processing is positively associated with vmHRV <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</p><p>The pupil of the eye has been used as a physiological system to study synchrony with respect to communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>. Pupil dilation is under control of the sympathetic nervous system, with reduced sympathetic activity resulting in wider pupil diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">54]</ref>. Under constant luminance conditions, pupil dilation is positively associated with emotional arousal, cognitive load, mental effort, conflict processing, and emotion regulation efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[57]</ref>. tDCS of the DLPFC during processing of emotional stimuli has opposite effects on pupil diameter depending on whether the lDLPFC or rDLPFC is stimulated, with tDCS of the lDLPFC being associated with increased pupil diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[58]</ref>. Similarly, chronic vagus nerve stimulation, a safe treatment for affective dysregulation, increases resting pupil diameter without affecting light reflexes <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref>. Spontaneously synchronized pupil dilation patterns across individuals (speaker-and-listener dyads) has been shown to be a marker of joint attention, with higher pupillary synchrony occurring during emotional peaks in communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[52]</ref>. Individual factors such as level of expressiveness in the speaker and level of empathy in the listener is positively associated with degree of synchrony, thus greater brain-to-brain coupling. For high-school students, silent gazing into a randomized peer's eyes for 2 minutes prior to class predicted greater brain-to-brain synchrony during class, as measured with electroencephalogram <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[44]</ref>. Together, the above data suggest that the neural mechanisms responsible for successful affective regulation is, at least in part, responsible for successful coordination and communication.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.4">Neural correlates of affective variability and control overlaps with neural correlates of complex problem-solving</head><p>Being involved in executive functioning, the DLPFC is also a central structure involved in working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">61]</ref> which is a resource with limited capacity that individuals use for problem solving. In line with this notion, complex problem solving is dependent brain networks where the DLPFC is a central component in breaking the problem up in individual tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[64]</ref>, representing contextual task-demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[65]</ref>, and cognitive control of perceptual information during loss of situational awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref>. Taken together with the fact that optimal allocation of attention to task-related stimuli is associated with psychophysiological proxies of DLPFC functioning and affective variability <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>, this can potentially have important implications for cyber operations. If cybersecurity personnel are simultaneously exposed to (1) complex technical problem solving, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> stressors that require conscious regulation of affective states, and (3) challenges related to communication, this will arguably tax the DLPFC and plausibly result in a conflict of information processing that can affect priorities and be detrimental to team performance. Together, the above studies suggest that there is a significant overlap in the neural substrates that affect success in both communication and affective control as well as problem solving. If DLPFC task-load reaches an individual's capacity threshold in one domain (e.g. affective regulation), functioning in the other domains (problems solving or communication) may break down. Thus, measures of indicators of affective variability at the level of the individual may provide important performance metrics related to inter-individual cooperation and coordination in collaborative settings such as cyber defense.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1.5</head><p>How affective states may relate to the Hybrid Space framework and the Orienting, Locating, Bridging (OLB) model</p><p>As the challenges that COs face span the cyber, physical, and social realm, COs must skillfully apply a wide range of cognitive abilities to flexibly transition between these contexts. To conceptualize the cognitive complexity and communicative challenges that COs face, work conducted in collaboration with our lab proposed the Hybrid Space (HS) framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The HS framework is based on cognitive engineering and focuses on the interconnectedness between cyber-and physical space, and the tension between tactical and strategic goals in decision-making to illustrate the cognitive landscape that COs must navigate <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1, a)</ref>. Knowing where you are in the HS requires the ability to observe your own mental state, termed metacognitive awareness, and to move within the HS requires cognitive agility <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1, b</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. When individuals such as team members or superordinates and subordinates are located in different quadrants of the HS, competencies, goals, and proximity to situational stressors may differ between them, making the nature of communication more difficult thus increasing the cognitive load on COs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1, c)</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>. When information is relayed back and forth across individuals with different locations in the HS, cognitive complexity increases <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">(Figure 1, d</ref> show that these representations occur spontaneously in the brain when an individual enters a social context (e.g. is shown a picture of a peer) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[67]</ref> and that this encoding rely on prefrontal structures involved in affective regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>. If affective variability is an indicator of prefrontal cortical function, then lower affective variability may indicate reduced prefrontal functioning thus ability to accurately represent one's own position in a social setting which may be detrimental to social cohesion.</p><p>To accurately locate other individuals in the HS requires perspective taking <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">69]</ref>. Taking the perspective of other individuals is partly dependent on empathy. Empathy is reliant on PFC structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref>, is positively associated with psychophysiological proxies of affective regulation such as vmHRV <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> and may in part explain some of the ways the PFC aids the individual in navigating a social network. Our lab recently proposed the Orienting, Locating, Bridging (OLB) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref>, a three-stage pedagogic tool to foster metacognitive awareness for improved communication flow in the HS. The OLB model explicates the steps an individual must take to facilitate communication and coordination across levels of expertise, hierarchical layers, and professional backgrounds. First, an individual must apply metacognition to find their own location in the HS (Orienting), then the individual must apply perspective taking to find the communication partner's location in the HS (Locating), then the individual must adapt their communication style and content to the partner depending on their own and the partner's location in the HS (Bridging).</p><p>Affective dysregulation could potentially prevent successful OLB-ing, either by forcing the individual to allocate attentional resources to their own affective states thus preventing them from engaging in model application (or communication in general), or at individual stages of the model depending on the timing of situational and affective challenges. For example, affective dysregulation could lead to problems with:</p><p>1. Orienting, via conflicts or deficits in shared mechanisms that relate affective regulation to metacognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref> or deficits in neurocognitive processing related to self-regulation such as being aware of and aligning emotional responses, cognitions, and behaviors to goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[72]</ref>.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">52]</ref>. Although numerous studies link affective variability to cooperative proxies and optimal social interactions, how this translates to collaboration in a cyber operation setting has yet to be explored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.6">Aim</head><p>We argue that multiple affective measurements taken during an exercise would be associated with team workload demands. Being able to measure how individual variable affective states influence team performance would give a better understanding of how to develop better interventions to increase metacognition, thus having better situational awareness and helping team performance. Research has shown that metacognition has positive influences on situational awareness and performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[76]</ref>. Thus, in this paper we examine the relationship between affective variability and team workload demands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participants and Procedure</head><p>Data was collected during the Norwegian Defense Cyber Academy's (NDCA) annual Cyber Defense Exercise (CDX). This arena facilitates the opportunity for students to train in tactics, techniques and procedures for handling various types of cyberattacks. The exercise contributes to improving appreciation for the human and technical competences necessary to establish, manage and defend a military digital information in-frastructure under simulated operational conditions. The exercise lasted five days. Before each day, the participants were asked to rate their affective states. At the end of the day the participants were asked to assess team performance. A total of 13 cadets participated in the research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Measurements</head><p>The Self-assessment Manikin <ref type="figure">(SAM;[77]</ref>) was used to measure affective states. The SAM is a 3-item 9-point Likert-scale (1 to 9) that measures mood (negative to positive), physiological activation (PA; little to much), and control (little to much). The SAM is a validated culture-and language independent visual scale that is used in performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref> research in different domains and populations including cyber environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[77]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[78]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[79]</ref>. Both mean and variability scores were computed. Affective variability was computed for the three aspects of the SAM using the formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">= � 1 ( − 1) �� +1 − ���� � =0</formula><p>where N is the total number of R peaks, RR j is the jth RR interval, RR is the mean of the RR intervals, j denotes the average of the RR intervals up to the jth. This resulted in three independent variables: Mood, Activation and Control. Higher mood indicates more positive mood, higher activation indicates more arousal, and higher control indicates higher self-efficacy. For this study, the SAM showed good reliability for each subscale (Mood Cronbach's a= .633; Activation Cronbach's a = .891; Control Cronbach's a = .928).</p><p>The Team Workload Questionnaire (TWLQ)[80] was used to assess the workload demand in team tasks. Items are scored on an 11-point Likert scale (range: very lowvery high) with high scores indicating higher levels of subjective workload. Average scores for team workload performance were computed on the subscales of the two dimensions, the Teamwork component (communication, coordination, team performance monitoring) and Task-Team component (time-share, team emotion, team support).</p><p>The TWLQ has shown good reliability on all subscales (Cronbach's a &gt;.70) [80] and also for this research (Teamwork Cronbach's a = .847; Task-team Cronbach's a = .624).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Ethical considerations</head><p>The study conformed to institutional guidelines and was eligible for automatic approval by the Norwegian Social Science Data Services' (NSD) ethical guidelines for experimental studies. Participants gave their informed consent verbally prior to the study and were informed that they could withdraw from participation at any time and without any consequences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Data Analysis</head><p>Statistical analysis was done with JASP version .14.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[81]</ref>. All variables were centered and standardized for analysis. Alpha levels for hypothesis testing were set at the 0.05 level. A multiple linear regression was computed with affective state measures (SAM) entered as predictors and the subscales of the TWLQ as criterion variables.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion and Conclusion</head><p>Recent research indicated that there is a scarcity of studies in cybersecurity that simultaneously assess team and individual factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In this study, we set out to assess the association between individual measurements of affective variability (Mood, Physiological Activation, and Control) on team workload demands (teamwork demands, taskteam demands). We found that higher affective variability could predict better teamwork behaviors (team performance monitoring) as well as decreasing the task-team workload demands. Participants with higher affective variability, as measured by the Self-Assessment Manikin, will impose less workload demands on the team, which can lead to better outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">82]</ref>. Previous studies showed that more flexible intra-individual psychological processes (i.e. variable self-efficacy) could predict better team outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[82]</ref>.</p><p>On a neurological level, while being important for regulating affective states <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>, the DLPFC is also important for complex and technical problem solving such as understanding computer code <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">64]</ref> and perceptual tasks such as sorting through perceptual stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[83,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">84]</ref>. Moreover, psychophysiological proxies for DLPFC functioning are associated with a sense of mastery as an adaptive individual trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>. In our study, we found that higher variable Control, an indicator of self-efficacy, was associated with less performance monitoring and less team support demands. In previous research, we showed that interoceptive ability, an indicator related to the cognitive perceptions of emotions and arousal, was moderated by self-efficacy during counterintuitive decisionmaking in officer cadets <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[85]</ref>. Self-efficacy may facilitate better cyber oriented decision-making in certain situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[86]</ref> and is negatively associated with stress arousal during task-engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[87]</ref>. Higher Control variability in our sample may be indicative of the level of expertise among COs, and recent research seems to suggest that cybersecurity experts need less intra-team communication and coordination compared to novices <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">89]</ref>.</p><p>A previous study suggested that increasing cybersecurity alerts were associated with drops in team performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[90]</ref>. The authors suggested that team dynamics were affected at the structural level with communication breaking down due to cognitive fatigue. As lower affective variability is due to limited capacity of prefrontal structures such as the DLPFC to exert top-down control on emotional states <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref> then it is possible that the (1) arousal was higher than participants were comfortable with (i.e. past optimal arousal levels) such that attention was focused inwards, (2) that affective states were competing with problem solving (3) and sorting between task-related perceptual stimuli to maintain situation awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[66]</ref>. Thus, lower affective variability in our sample may reflect reduced capacity for situational load thus higher team support demands.</p><p>Inability to regulate one's own affective states will also affect the capacity to help regulate other individual's affective states due to low tolerance for cognitive-emotional load <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[91,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">92]</ref>. If an individual must spend cognitive effort on regulating their own stressand affective arousal, less cognitive capacity can be allocated to help handle other people's stress levels. If communication dyads are significantly stressed without capacity to down-regulate their own arousal, this may result in a positive feedback loop elevating arousal-related conflict levels during communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref>. A recent preliminary report on US army computer network defense teams participating in a CDX reported that arguing in cyber defense teams was negatively associated with team performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[93]</ref>. The authors reported that frequent arguing was negatively associated with two performance measures: (1) the time between start of an inject to returned rapport approval by team controller, and (2) the percentage of category of injects correctly identified by the blue team. The study did, however, not report p-values for this relationship. This can have major consequences in high-stress, high time-pressure social settings such as cyber threat situations. The relationship between affective variability, characteristics of communication among cyber team members, and performance in a CDX should be assessed in future studies. This is the first study to assess how individual emotional adaptability affects team dynamics in a cyber defense setting. Our findings suggest avenues for metacognitive training on self-regulation strategies as well as advocating the need for neuroergonomic approaches to understanding how the interrelatedness between different domains of challenge to individual CO performance might affect team performance in cybersecurity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Limitations</head><p>There are several limitations for the study. An a priori power analysis (G*Power <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[94]</ref>) showed that the minimum number of participants needed (N = 17) to achieve medium effect sizes (f 2 = .25), our study only had 13, but was the full cohort of the group. This, alongside that the study is correlational in nature and all variables are self-reported, meaning the results need to be interpreted with caution as type I and II error may occur since several results were near significance levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Conclusion</head><p>Future research on team performance in cybersecurity should include variable measurements of individual factors as they are more sensitive and may have better explanatory power for performance measurements than team-level measures alone.</p></div>
