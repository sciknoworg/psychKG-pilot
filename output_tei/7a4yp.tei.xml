			<abstract>
				<p>Prosocial behaviours are essential for solving global challenges. Typically these behaviours are measured using economic games or tasks where people decide between helping or not. However, in everyday life, current behaviours are interrupted with alternatives. Across three samples, people (total n=510) watched a movie whilst encountering opportunities to interrupt it to benefit another person or themselves. Crucially, participants decided in poor and rich environments where the average reward values of opportunities changed. We demonstrate a robust environmental influence on decisions that benefit others. People were more willing to interrupt their behaviour to help others in poor compared to rich environments. Computational modelling revealed that the opportunity costs of different environments were valued distinctly for others. Factors of utilitarianism, empathy and motivation, captured variability in opportunity costs for others. We show that when we decide to engage in prosocial behaviours depends on the environment which is critical as environments change.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Humans constantly decide whether to interrupt what they are doing to try something else.</p><p>However, current experimental paradigms often present people with two options to decide between, which do not reflect these kinds of decisions people face in everyday life <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</p><p>Indeed, in the real world we come across opportunities to interrupt what we are doing for other potential rewards. We are asked to stop to help kids with homework or make tea for our partners whilst watching TV or scrolling through social media. Theories from behavioural ecology describing non-human animal behaviour suggest that deciding when to act depends on the opportunity costs in one's environment-i.e., the value of what we are doing now compared to everything else we could be doing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. How these environmental influences extend to human behaviour is beginning to be uncovered <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7)</ref>, yet whether these influences extend to decisions that affect other people is still unknown. This is despite such prosocial behaviours being key to solving global challenges <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> and for societal cohesion broadly <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. Indeed, the nature of altruism is a fundamental question of being human <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Does when we decide to help others depend on the richness of our environment?</p><p>Human prosocial behaviour is often measured using economic games such as the dictator game, trust game, or the prisoner's dilemma (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Other studies have compared twoalternative forced choices between exerting effort for rewards or resting <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>. While these paradigms present people with many decisions, they may not capture the types of everyday behaviours and prosocial decisions that our brains evolved to solve <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20)</ref>. In real-world settings, one's current behaviour is interrupted by a choice to help others, or to do something else more beneficial for oneself. Decision-making researchers have begun to measure these more naturalistic behaviours using paradigms and approaches from behavioural ecology <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. How different environments affects decisions to act to help other people, however, remains unclear. This is despite many decisions we make having direct impacts on other people, and not only ourselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</p><p>More broadly, research in social psychology has examined the environmental factors that determine when we help others. For example, the presence of others <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>, the urgency of the situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33)</ref>, or the perceived costs of acting <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> can influence how likely we are to act to help <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. The impact of the broader environmental context, however, is less clear.</p><p>The richness of one's social environment-i.e., relationships, social network, etc.-relates to levels of prosocial behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, but the specific impact of one's economic environment is highly debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. Some studies report that those who are financially poorer may be more prosocial <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>, while others report the opposite <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(48)</ref>. However, these studies are often correlational and do not experimentally manipulate the environment. Therefore, whether poorer environments lead to higher levels of prosociality, and the mechanisms that ultimately drive decisions about when to help others are still unknown.</p><p>In both humans and non-human animals, one's environment strongly influences decisions about when and how to act <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. Studies on foraging behaviour have shown that the quality, or richness, of an animal's environment determines how it chooses its prey. A seminal study in birds showed that in rich environments, where the average quality of prey is higher, animals will forgo low-quality prey and instead selectively wait for better options <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref>.</p><p>When the environment is poor-i.e., where the average quality of prey is lower-animals will eat the low-quality prey at the same rate as higher quality prey they encounter. This environmental influence on deciding when to act for oneself has been observed in a wide range of animals, from worms to monkeys <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref> and more recently in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23)</ref>. To date, most human studies have focused on decisions within a foraging context, such as whether to explore a patch in which one resides, or leave to exploit an alternative patch (50).</p><p>Here we were interested in whether the richness of one's environment influences decisionmaking about when to interrupt behaviour to help others in a similar or different manner to those decisions that only affect ourselves.</p><p>To accomplish this we combined well-established theories and computational principles about animal behaviour from behavioural ecology and decision neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> to test the impact of poor and rich environments on decisions about when to help others. Across 3 separate studies (study 1 n = 237, study 2 n = 219, study 3 n = 54), we adapted a prey selection paradigm where people watched a movie and encountered opportunities to earn potential rewards by exerting a fixed amount of physical effort, calibrated to their own ability ( <ref type="figure">Figure    1a</ref>). Crucially, on some trials, participants had the chance to interrupt their ongoing behaviour to win rewards for an anonymous other person. The opportunities signalled the magnitude and probability of receiving the reward, and their frequency differed in constructed poor and rich environments. If the participant decided to act and pursue the opportunity, the movie would disappear while they completed the effort task. If the participant declined the opportunity, they did not have to take any action; the movie continued playing and the opportunity disappeared after a few seconds. We instructed participants that their decisions would be completely anonymous, and that the other player would be unaware that the participant would be earning rewards on their behalf. This allowed the 'other' trials to be identical in all aspects to 'self' trials except for the reward recipient, and controlled for motives such as reciprocity and reputation affecting prosocial decisions.</p><p>Across all studies, we show a robust environmental influence on decisions to act that is stronger when deciding to help others compared to oneself. We found that participants were more likely to interrupt their behaviour in poor environments than in rich ones as the quality of the reward increased, and that this environmental effect was larger when deciding for others.</p><p>Computational modelling revealed that opportunity costs were distinctly encoded for self and others in different environments, and that people were equally sensitive to value when deciding for others in a poor environment as for themselves in a rich environment. Distinct factors of utilitarianism and empathy/motivation, but not psychiatric traits, were related to variability in opportunity costs for others. Together, we demonstrate that choosing to act to help others depends on the quality of one's environment, and that this environmental influence is stronger than when deciding to help oneself. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Prosocial Ecology Task. Participants watching an episode of a nature documentary encountered opportunities to earn rewards. (a) The task was divided into blocks of trials that differed based on the environment and reward recipient. At the start of each block, the task signalled to the participant whether they were in a poor or a rich environment and whether they were playing for themselves or an anonymous other. Within each block, participants saw opportunities (coloured ovals with dots inside) to earn potential rewards while watching the movie. The colour and number of dots of the offer (b) represented the potential reward's magnitude and probability, respectively. If participants chose to accept the opportunity, the movie was hidden and Reward magnitude Reward probability a brief effort task appeared (note: study 3's effort task duration was 3 s). This task had participants repeatedly press an on-screen button (studies and 2, displayed here) or squeeze a handheld grip device (study 3; see Methods) to 60% or 50% of their maximum effort threshold, respectively. The screen would then display the amount of reward earned, based on the colour of the opportunity. The screen would sometimes display "0 credits" based on the reward's probability (more likely if the number of dots was low), if the participant rejected the offer, or if the participant failed the effort task. If participants instead chose to decline the opportunity, no action was required and the offer disappeared while the movie continued to play. The same movie played across all the blocks. In half of the blocks, participants earned rewards for themselves and for an anonymous other person in the other half. The blocks also differed in environmental richness, with half of the blocks comprising a poor environment and the other half a rich environment. (c) Importantly, both environments saw the same range of reward magnitude and probabilities. However, on average, reward opportunities in the poor environment were lower in magnitude and probability compared to those in the rich environment. The frequency shown in the heatmap here refers to the number of trials in studies 1 and 2 (note: study 3 had twice as many trials) for the different levels of reward magnitude and probability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>People act to help others more in poor compared to rich environments</head><p>Participants in study 1 (n = 237 participants, aged 18-35 years, M (SD) = 28.8 (4.4); selfreported gender: 124 women, 112 men, 1 non-binary) completed the novel Prosocial Ecology Task <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>. We tested our central pre-registered hypothesis (AsPredicted #102887) that the richness of the environment would influence decisions to act for others differently from decisions that benefit oneself. To do so, we built a generalised linear mixed-effects model (see Methods) that included environment (poor vs. rich), recipient (self vs. other), and the expected value of the reward (magnitude*probability) as predictors of choices to act-i.e., to skip part of the movie and pursue other potential rewards. We found that, as expected value increased, participants were more likely to choose to act in the poor environment compared to the rich one, and that this difference was greater when the choice benefitted the other person relative to oneself (three-way interaction: odds ratio (OR) = 1.49, 95% confidence interval [1.05, 2.12], z = 2.20, p = 0.027, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 2a</ref>, see <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> for full model results). In other words, people decided to act more often in poor environments compared to rich ones, and this environmental influence was stronger when making prosocial decisions than self-benefitting ones.</p><p>In line with our pre-registration, we ran several control analyses to account for potential effects of fatigue and previously seen opportunities. We first included trial number, as a proxy for fatigue, to the model before also adding the previous trial's choice and expected value. After controlling for all these variables, we still found that people were more likely to help others in poor environments (three-way interaction: OR = 1.42 <ref type="bibr">[1.10, 1.83]</ref>, z = 2.69, p = 0.007). We also observed that participants were less likely to choose to act over time (OR = 0.52 [0.48, 0.57], z = 15.07, p &lt; 0.001), but were more likely to act if they had done so on the previous opportunity (OR = 1.21 <ref type="bibr">[1.09, 1.35]</ref>, z = 3.53, p &lt; 0.001). There was no statistically significant effect of the expected value on the preceding opportunity (OR = 0.97 [0.93, 1.01], z = 1.65, p = 0.098, BF01 = 47.17; see <ref type="table">Table S2</ref> for full results). In other words, the observed environmental interaction on participants' choices was present even after accounting for potential effects of fatigue or autocorrelation in choices (e.g., by repeating the same actions from previous trials).</p><p>We also tested our pre-registered analysis of reward magnitude and probability as separate predictors to examine if expected value effects were driven by reward magnitude or probability alone. We observed that participants were more likely choose to act at higher reward magnitudes (OR = 2.33 <ref type="bibr">[2.09, 2.60]</ref>, z = 15.03, p &lt; 0.001) and at higher probabilities (OR = 7.05 <ref type="bibr">[6.00, 8.32]</ref>, z = 23.51, p &lt; 0.001). People were more likely to choose to act for themselves than for others when the probability was high (reward probability*recipient: OR = 0.83 [0.71, 0.97], z = 2.29, p = 0.022, see <ref type="table">Table S3</ref> for full model results).</p><p>Second, we ran a control analysis to test whether participants could still exert the required effort (60% of their maximum button presses) at the end of the experiment by measuring participants' effort thresholds again after completing the main task (see Methods). We found that people were still able to achieve the required effort, with higher effort post-task compared to the start (t(233) = 10.55, p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.69 [0.60, 0.79]). We also checked that participants were able to successfully perform the effort task after choosing to act and found that participants were indeed highly successful (M = 99.4% success rate) for both self and other.</p><p>At the end of the study we asked participants how much they enjoyed watching the movie and whether they had seen it previously. The majority of participants had not seen the movie before . This suggests that interrupting the movie indeed elicited an opportunity cost. In summary, study 1 showed participants were more likely to decide to act to help others in poor environments, and these effects were not driven by fatigue, the influence of the previous trial, or inability to perform the effort task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opportunities to help are accepted more for self than other</head><p>Previous studies have shown that despite humans being willing to help others, for example by splitting amounts of money <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> or putting in effort to earn rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">52)</ref>, they are somewhat selfish and much less willing to benefit others than they are to benefit themselves.</p><p>In such studies, people will unevenly divide a pot of money between themselves and others and exert less effort to win rewards for others. We found that even though participants had the option to carry on watching a movie, they still interrupted their behaviour to help others a significant portion of the time <ref type="bibr">(</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>People are more willing to act in poor environments</head><p>Research in behavioural ecology shows that the richness of the environment affects animals' decisions to forage for food <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">50)</ref>. Models of prey selection predict that in rich environments, where the quantity and quality of food is high, animals will become more selective in their foraging behaviour. In poorer environments, animals become less selective and are more likely to forage for food that they might have otherwise refused in a rich environment. In line with these models, we found that, for equivalent opportunities, people were more likely to choose to act in the poor environment compared to the rich one (poor vs.</p><p>rich: OR = 0.50 [0.40, 0.62], z = 6.36, p &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 2</ref>; see <ref type="table">Table S1</ref> for full results). For example, participants encountered medium magnitude/probability opportunities at the same rate in both environments (see central squares in <ref type="figure">Figure 1c</ref>). However, they were significantly more likely to accept an opportunity when it appeared in the poor environment compared to when the same opportunity appeared in the rich environment (see also 22).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Greater environmental effect on money earned for others</head><p>Finally, we tested whether differences in decisions to act were reflected in the number of credits participants earned for themselves and the other person, which translated into bonus money at the end of the study. Importantly, the opportunities presented for self were identical to those presented for other, across both environments (see Methods). We found that participants earned more credits in the rich environment relative to the poor one (poor vs. rich:  <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>). In essence, participants earned substantially more from opportunities for themselves than for others when in rich environments. In poor environments their own earnings were much closer to those for the other. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">Figure 2</ref>. Humans decide to help others more often in poor environments. Results from study 1 (n = 237). (a) There was a significant interaction between recipient, environment, and reward expected value.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental effects extend to different types of effort and recipient</head><p>In study 3, we tested whether our findings extended to different forms of effort and recipients (n = 54, aged 18-32 years, M (SD) = 21.9 (3.2), 39 women, 15 men). We invited participants to the lab where they anonymously met the other person before performing the same task as above. To introduce the participant to the other person, we used a previously established role assignment procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53)</ref>. This procedure allows participants to meet each other yet does not reveal any identifying information such as gender, age, or physical characteristics (see Methods) to minimise any influence of these factors on prosocial decisions. For this inperson version, participants used a grip-force device to exert physical effort, rather than rapidly pressing an on-screen button using the computer mouse. Before completing the task, we measured their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and used a fixed effort level of 50% MVC for the effort task, to threshold it to their own ability.</p><p>Replicating our findings from studies 1 and 2, we found a stronger effect of the environment on participants' decisions of when to act to help others (three-way interaction: OR = 1.92 [1.32, 2.80], z = 3.40, p &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3d</ref>, see <ref type="table">Table S6</ref> for model results). This significant interaction remained when controlling for trial number as well as the choice and expected value on the preceding opportunity (three-way interaction: OR = 2.05 <ref type="bibr">[1.41, 3</ref>.01], z = 3.70, p &lt; 0.001). Participants were again less likely to act on an opportunity over time and more when the preceding expected value was higher (all ps &lt; 0.001), but we found no significant effect of their previous choice on their current decision to act (p = 0.49; see <ref type="table">Table S7</ref> for model results).  Results from study (n = 219) and study 3 (n = 54). For all three studies there was a significant interaction between recipient, environment, and expected value. (a, study 2; b, study 3) At higher expected values, participants were more likely to act to help others in poor environments compared to rich ones. When the decision to act benefitted oneself, the environment had less of an impact. The shaded bands around the lines represent 95% confidence intervals of the mean. (c, study 2; d, study 3) On average, participants chose to act to earn rewards more for themselves than for others. (e, study 2; f, study 3) Participants were more likely to choose to act for a given opportunity when it appeared in a poor environment as compared to a rich one.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants over-exert for themselves and in poor environments</head><p>Study 3 additionally allowed us to examine how much physical force participants exerted in the different environments and for the different recipients. We calculated the normalised area under the curve of the force exerted on a hand-grip device and examined whether this was modulated by deciding for self vs. other, environment, and expected value (see Methods). Participants exerted more force at higher expected values in the poor environment compared to the rich one (environment*expected value: b = -0.016, [-0.026, -0.005], z = 2.94, p = 0.003; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>), but there was no overall interaction between recipient and environment (b = 0.004 [-0.022, 0.029], z = 0.29, p = 0.78, BF01 = 82.29). We found that participants exerted more force to benefit themselves than for others overall (self vs. other b = -0.054 [-0.074, -0.034], z = 5.52, p &lt; 0.001). Together these findings suggest that participants over-exerted in poor environments when the expected value was higher and for opportunities for themselves. Overall participants in study 3 exerted significantly more physical force when trying to win potential rewards for themselves than for others. There was a significant interaction between environment and expected value which showed that participants tended to exert more force in poor environments when the expected value was higher.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Opportunity cost parameters are encoded distinctly for prosocial and self-benefitting decisions</head><p>Linear mixed effects models showed that participants were more influenced in poor environments than in rich ones to help others compared to themselves. However, these models cannot quantify latent influences on participants' behaviour in terms of weighting opportunity costs, sensitivity to value, or non-linear influences on decision-making. We therefore built a wide range of computational models based on decision neuroscience to quantify how opportunity costs of different environments influenced decisions to act for self and other, and fit them to the choice data from the 3 studies to maximise power (total n = 510).</p><p>These models quantified whether the opportunity costs (o parameter) differed between environments, between recipients, or whether a single parameter applied across all conditions. Higher opportunity costs suggest that alternatives (continuing to watch the movie, avoiding the effort task, etc.) may be more worthwhile to pursue than the current opportunity.</p><p>We also included a value sensitivity (inverse temperature) parameter (b) that captured the degree to which value sensitivity influenced choice consistency and to fit the models to behaviour. Each class of model tested whether this value sensitivity parameter differed between environments, between recipients, or a single parameter was sufficient. Finally, based on studies in economics we included models that varied the functional form by which opportunity costs discounted probabilistic rewards (54-58) (see Methods).</p><p>We found that participants' choices to act were best explained by a model with distinct opportunity cost (oself/poor, oself/rich, oother/poor, oother/rich) and value sensitivity (βself/poor, βself/rich,  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5d</ref>). This suggests that people were equally sensitive to the opportunity costs when making other-benefitting decisions in poor environments as they were when making self-benefitting decisions in rich environments.</p><p>We additionally observed that participants were more value-sensitive to opportunities that Therefore, computational modelling revealed how people were influenced by opportunity costs and value sensitivity when making prosocial decisions. The processing of opportunity costs confirmed our findings from model-free behaviour, while computations of value sensitivity suggested that how sensitive people are to making prosocial decisions in poor environments can be equivalent to self-benefitting decisions in rich environments. The winning model showed a significant interaction between recipient and environment showing opportunity costs were lower when deciding to help others in poor compared to rich environments. (d) There was strong Bayesian evidence of no difference in value sensitivity to opportunity costs of prosocial decisions in poor environments compared to self-benefitting decisions in rich environments (BF01 = 18.98). The error bars represent the standard error of the mean; the coloured dots represent the estimated parameters for each participant. The axis label subscripts s, o, r, and p in panels a and b represent the self, other, rich, and poor conditions, respectively. XP = exceedance probability; *** p &lt; 0.001. We correlated each factor with participants' parameter estimates from the winning model <ref type="figure">(Figure 6b</ref>; p-values were FDR adjusted, see Methods). The factor 'Utilitarianism' showed significant negative correlations with opportunity costs in both rich (r(504) = -0.18, p &lt; 0.001) and poor (r(504) = -0.14, p = 0.007) environments when deciding for others, but not when deciding for oneself (self-poor: r(504) = -0.06, p = 0.29, BF01 = 8.06; self-rich: r(504) = -0.01, p = 0.86, BF01 = 17.62), with strong Bayesian evidence favouring no difference. The factor 'Empathy and emotional motivation' showed a significant negative correlation with opportunity costs only in rich environments when deciding for others (r(504) = -0.11, p = 0.041), but not when deciding for oneself (self-poor: r(504) = -0.03, p = 0.60, BF01 = 14.35; self-rich: r(504) = -0.01, p = 0.86, BF01 = 17.55), also with strong Bayesian evidence favouring no difference. This suggests that, for those higher in empathy and with stronger beliefs about maximizing others' well-being, the opportunity costs when deciding to help others are smaller, leading them to be more likely to interrupt their ongoing behaviour to help. Importantly there was also Bayesian evidence that psychiatric traits did not explain variance in computing opportunity costs for others (all BF01s &gt; 3.40; see <ref type="table">Table S8</ref>). <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Variability in opportunity costs for others relates to empathy and utilitarianism. (a) Individual factor loadings for the subscales of the questionnaires administered. Our factor analysis revealed three dimensions of behaviour related to psychiatric traits, empathy and emotional motivation, and utilitarianism. Note: the loadings displayed here are absolute values. (b) The factors 'Empathy and emotional motivation' and 'Utilitarianism' related to opportunity costs when deciding for others. Those who are more empathetic and emotionally motivated, or with stronger utilitarian beliefs, may find helping others less costly and may be more willing to interrupt their behaviour to help others. </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">1 β 2 β s/o 2 β p/r 4 β 4 β 2 β p/r 2 β s/o 1 β 1 o 2 o s/o 2 o p/r 4 o 1 o 2 o s/o 2 o p/r 4 o 1 o 2 o s/o 2 o p/r 4 o 1 o 2 o s/o 2 o p/r 4 o 1 o 2 o s/o 2 o p/r 4 o 1 o 2 o s/o 2 o p/r 4 o 1 o 2 o s/o 2 o p/r 4 o 1 o 2 o s/o 2 o p/r 4 o Simulated Estimated 0.0 0.5 1.0 XP o s/p o s/r o o/p o o/r β s/p β s/r β o/p β o/r α o s/p o s/r o o/p o o/r β s/p β s/r β o/p</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Prosocial behaviours are key to building and maintaining social connections and well-being.</p><p>However, previous studies have typically assessed these behaviours by presenting people with two options to decide between rather than choosing when to act prosocially. Other work in behavioural ecology and social psychology suggests that deciding when to act depends on one's environment, but whether the environment's richness impacts prosociality is unknown.</p><p>Across 3 studies we show that deciding when to help others is indeed influenced by one's environment. Participants were more likely to act to earn rewards in poor compared to rich environments, and the strength of this environmental effect was enhanced when deciding for others. Computational modelling revealed that decisions were determined by comparing expected rewards with different opportunity costs for each environment and recipient. Distinct factors of utilitarianism, and empathy/motivation, but not psychiatric traits, were related to variability in computing opportunity costs when deciding for others. People were also similarly sensitive to the value of opportunities in rich environments for themselves as for opportunities in poor environments for others. Together these findings show a stronger environmental influence on decisions about when to help others compared to decisions for ourselves.</p><p>In the laboratory, prosocial behaviours are often assessed using economic games, where two or more options are presented simultaneously, and often a decision is required. This can give rise to behaviour that appears prosocial, but may instead be a consequence of the study's design-e.g., choosing an effortful option to avoid boredom or to appease the experimenter <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(59)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(60)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(61)</ref>. In nature, however, choosing between options is rarely done simultaneously <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63)</ref>. Rather, choices are made sequentially, where the decision is either to accept or reject the current option (64). Our design allowed participants to freely choose when to act to help an anonymous stranger, rather than forcing an action on every trial. Importantly, using this ecological design, participants were still surprisingly prosocial and willing to interrupt their behaviour roughly half of the time to help others. This finding contributes to debates surrounding the nature of human altruism <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. People will stop doing something enjoyable to experience a cost to help another person, even though this will not result in any reward for themselves.</p><p>A fundamental debate in social psychology is whether poorer or richer people are more or less prosocial. Existing work has often used self-report or observational designs which has led to mixed findings regarding whether poor environments alter prosociality <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(48)</ref>. Here, using an experimental design, we show that directly manipulating one's environment to be poor can shift decisions towards helping others. This finding may at first appear counterintuitive, as opportunities in the poor environment were overall worse compared to the rich environment. However, this pattern of behaviour can be seen in many non-human animals when foraging for food <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. In poor environments, opportunity costs are lower due to the alternatives also being poor, and so searching for high-quality options can be time-consuming.</p><p>In rich environments, where higher-quality options are more abundant, selectively waiting to act on high-value opportunities can maximise rewards while minimising costs (e.g., time spent searching). This suggests the environmental effect observed on other-benefitting decisions may reflect fundamental mechanisms shared with other non-human animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25)</ref>. An interesting avenue for future research is to observe these mechanisms in more natural settings by manipulating one's immediate, real-world environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">66)</ref>. How these environmental factors translate to one's broader socioeconomic environment remains to be investigated, but here we suggest a paradigm to use in future studies where the influence of the environment is critical to assess.</p><p>Other work in humans and non-human primates suggests that contextual features of one's environment that drive when to act are tracked via a habenula-insular circuit <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">67)</ref>. Our computational modelling suggests that these features, specifically expected reward values, are discounted by distinct opportunity costs for different environments and recipients, before being used to decide when to act. Future work may examine how the brain represents these opportunity costs, and whether, like for physical effort, they are represented in distinct areas for self and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Opportunity costs also related to individual levels of empathy/emotional motivation and utilitarianism, yet not to psychiatric traits. This suggest that people who are more empathetic and emotionally motivated, or with stronger utilitarian beliefs, find it less costly and are more willing to interrupt their behaviour to help others, which may challenge purely cognitive accounts of vicarious experience as a motivator for decisions to act. It also supports theoretical accounts of the links between empathy and altruism <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(68)</ref> showing that in paradigms where people engage in costly helping, such costly helping is more prevalent in individuals with higher self-reported empathy. Intriguingly, emotional motivation is also crucial here <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(69,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">70)</ref>, with those reporting the highest emotional motivation weighting opportunity costs less strongly and therefore being more willing to act to help others.</p><p>Our computational modelling also allowed us to compare sensitivity to the rewards for self and other and between rich and poor environments. The value sensitivity (i.e., inverse temperature) parameter captures the stochasticity in choices. Higher values indicate that choices are more strongly influenced by an opportunity's value, and lower values indicate more randomness or exploration in choices. Intriguingly, we found that people on average were similarly value sensitive to offers for themselves in rich environments as for others in poor ones, suggesting that self and other became more computationally similar depending on the environmental context in which the decision is being made. Together with our choice behaviour findings, people appear to be only slightly selfish in poor environments but are much more selfish in rich environments. It would be interesting for future studies to probe whether corresponding neural representations follow this same pattern, particularly in brain areas such as the anterior cingulate gyrus and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex which have been shown to track prosocial decisions more strongly than self-benefitting ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(71)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to these strengths there are also limitations. Across all three studies we also found that most participants enjoyed watching the movie and had never seen it before. This suggests that their decisions to interrupt the movie to act were biased by true opportunity costs, rather than simply a desire to avoid a boring movie. Nevertheless, future studies with even higher ecological validity could be developed to test how the stronger environmental influence we Overall, we robustly show that humans are more likely to choose to help others in poor than in rich environments. Variability in tracking opportunity costs of different environments for others relates to empathic and utilitarian traits but not to anxiety or depression. Moreover, the sensitivity to values that help others in poor environments is similar to helping oneself in a rich environment. These findings have implications for elucidating when and why humans decide to help others and could be critical for understanding prosocial decision-making as environments change.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prosocial ecology task</head><p>Participants watched an episode of the nature documentary Blue Planet II (BBC Studios, 2017) during which opportunities to earn rewards appeared on the screen <ref type="figure">(Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>Opportunities were presented as coloured ovals with dots inside. The colour of the oval and dots represented the magnitude of the potential reward (5, 10, or 20 credits) and the number of dots represented the probability of being given the reward (0 -100%; <ref type="figure">Figure 1b)</ref>. The colour-magnitude combinations were randomized between participants. If the participant chose to accept the opportunity, they did so by pressing the space bar on the computer's keyboard. Doing so would mute and hide the video while an effort task appeared on screen.</p><p>Crucially, the movie continued to play while hidden, so deciding to act on the opportunity meant that the participant would miss part of the movie. For the effort task in studies 1 and 2, participants had 6 seconds to rapidly press an on-screen button until they reached 60% of their maximum number of presses (see Procedure section). For study 3, participants needed to squeeze and maintain a handheld dynamometer to at least 50% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC; see Procedure section). If participants failed to exert enough effort within 3 seconds, they failed the effort task and did not receive any reward. If participants exerted enough effort, they were given the reward based on its probability (i.e., the number of dots in the offer).</p><p>The task was divided into 4 separate blocks (8 blocks in study 3) that differed in environments and the recipient of the rewards (each unique block was presented twice in study 3). In half of the blocks, participants could earn rewards for themselves and in the other half they could earn rewards for an anonymous other person. Additionally, in half of the blocks, opportunities appeared in a poor environment and in the other half they appeared in a rich environment.</p><p>Importantly, both environments saw the same types of opportunities. For example, high magnitude/high probability rewards appeared in the poor environment and low magnitude/low probability rewards appeared in the rich one. The average frequency of these opportunities differed between environments <ref type="figure">(Figure 1c)</ref>, such that in poor environments, the expected value of the reward (magnitude*probability) was on average lower compared to the rich environment.</p><p>At the start of each block, the task displayed the type of environment and who would receive the rewards. Each block consisted of 36 trials ('opportunities') to earn rewards. Block orders were randomized between participants and trial orders were pseudorandomized. When an opportunity appeared, participants had 1.5 seconds to act upon it. If they accepted the offer, the video was hidden and muted while the effort task appeared, otherwise the video continued to play. The duration the video played was the same whether participants accepted the opportunity or not. Finally, between trials there was a 1-4 second delay before the next opportunity appeared. For studies and 2, there were a total of 4 attention checks throughout the task. For this, participants simply needed to press an on-screen button once within 3 seconds to pass the check. At the end of the session, bonus money was awarded based on the total number of credits earned during self trials. Online participant data were collected using Gorilla Experiment Builder (www.gorilla.sc).

We measured individual differences in apathy and motivation using Depression and Anxiety Stress Scales. We used the shortened version of the Depression and Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) to measure individual differences in anxiety and depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(74)</ref>. The shortened DASS is a 21-item scale that measures stress, depression, and anxiety using different subscales. Participants are asked to rate how each item applies to themselves using a 4-point Likert scale. For each item, higher scores indicate higher levels of the given emotional state. For the present studies, we excluded questions from the stress subscale, as we were specifically interested in the effects of depression and anxiety.</p><p>Oxford Utilitarianism Scale. We measured individual differences in utilitarian beliefs using the Oxford Utilitarianism Scale (OUS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(75)</ref>. The OUS is a 9-item scale that measures utilitarian beliefs in positive and negative dimensions using two separate subscales. Participants are asked to rate their level of agreement with each item using a 7-point Likert scale. For each item, higher scores indicate stronger utilitarian beliefs in the given dimension.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Study 1 and study 2. Before completing the main task and before any instructions, participants completed an effort thresholding procedure. For this, participants repeatedly pressed an on-screen button as fast as possible for 6 seconds using the computer mouse.</p><p>Each button press filled a coloured bar on screen to provide visual feedback. Participants repeated this procedure twice more and were encouraged to fill the coloured bar to a line that was 110% of their current maximum. This thresholding procedure was used to determine how much effort (i.e., number of button presses) was needed in the main prosocial ecology task after accepting an opportunity. Participants then received instructions on how to complete the main task and were told that they would be playing alongside another anonymous person online (Player 2), whose identity would not be revealed to them. In reality, this second player did not exist and participants simply completed the task on their own. We told participants that in the task they could sometimes earn credits that would be given to the other player, but that Player 2 would not be earning credits for the participant themselves. To reinforce the idea that Player 2 was a real person, we introduced them using a fake Prolific participant identifying number that was similar in resemblance to the participant's own number. No participants indicated disbelief that Player 2 was a real person in our debriefing questions at the end of the study. Participants completed 5 practice trials before performing the main task. After completing the main task, we measured participants' effort thresholds again using the same procedure from the beginning of the study. Finally, participants completed the questionnaires and answered questions related to the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3.</head><p>The procedure used in study 3 was nearly identical to that used in studies 1 and 2.</p><p>The two key differences were as follows: (1) the modality of the effort task after accepting an opportunity to act, (2) how Player 2 was introduced. For the effort task, participants exerted force by squeezing the handle of a dynamometer rather than pressing an on-screen button. In the main task participants needed to exert force to at least 50% of their maximum voluntary contraction (MVC; determined using the same effort thresholding procedure as above, but instructing participants to squeeze as hard as they can) for a minimum of 1 second to succeed.</p><p>This effort target was reduced relative to the online version of the task, as squeezing the grip-force device required more effort than repeatedly pressing a computer mouse button. To introduce Player 2, we used a role assignment procedure from earlier social decision-making studies to minimize social preferences of reciprocity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">53)</ref>. Participants were anonymously introduced to the other participant, who was a confederate, in person. To ensure that they remained anonymous, we instructed both participants to remain silent and wear gloves to hide physical characteristics when meeting.

To assign roles to each participant, the experimenter tossed a coin to determine who picked a ball out of box first. The colour of the ball determined who was Player 1 and who was Player 2. The procedure was fixed so that the real participant was always assigned the role of Player 1 and the confederate participant assigned the role of Player 2. After the roles were assigned, we emphasized to the real participant that Player 2 would be unaware of Player 1's tasks being performed, and that any rewards earned on their behalf would be anonymous.

Examining participants' effort thresholds before and after the main task showed again that thresholds were higher at the end of the study (t(217) = 9.32, p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.63 [0.52, 0.75]), again suggesting that participants were not fatigued by the effort task. We also asked participants how much they enjoyed watching the movie and whether they had seen it previously. the difference between credits earned for self and for other was smaller in the poor environment as compared to the rich one ( <ref type="figure">Figure S1)</ref>.

See <ref type="table">Table S10</ref> for all results from the model. Finally, as in studies 1 and 2, we found that participants were very successful in the effort task when they chose to act on the opportunity for both self and other (M = 98.7%). We found that participants' effort thresholds measured at the end of the study were lowered compared to those at the beginning (t(53) = 2.45, p = 0.018, d = 0.33 [0.08, 0.57]). We also replicated effects of an interaction between recipient and environment in the amount of credits earned ( <ref type="figure">Figure    S1</ref>).

This model had the highest exceedance probability and explained a large portion of the variance in choices (R 2 = 0.83). Data simulations showed that the model was robust and had excellent model identifiability (Figure 5a) and parameter recovery(Figure 5b, see Methods).First, comparing the four opportunity cost parameters, we found a larger environmental effect on opportunity costs to help others compared to helping oneself (recipient*environment: b = 0.10 [0.06, 0.13], z = 5.66, p &lt; 0.001; Figure 5c), reflecting the model-free results. Opportunity costs were higher in rich environments (poor vs. rich: b = 0.13 [0.11, 0.15], z = 13.44, p &lt; 0.001) and when the outcome affected another person (self vs. other: b = 0.34 [0.31, 0.37], z = 21.39, p &lt; 0.001). In other words, when deciding to act for both self and others, opportunity costs were smaller in the poor environment compared to the rich one. When the decision benefitted another person, this difference between environments grew wider, suggesting that one's current environment affects decisions to act help other others more than decisions for oneself. Next, testing the value sensitivity parameters, we found that value sensitivity in the poor environment for others reached the same level as the rich environment for self. A Bayesian ttest provided strong Bayesian evidence of no difference between the two conditions (t(507) = 1.22, p = 0.22, BF01 = 18.98,</figDesc></figure>

To do so, we conducted a factor analysis on the questionnaires that participants completed (see Methods). This allowed us to extract underlying dimensions of behaviour measured across the questionnaires (e.g., depression and anxiety scores were highly correlated, r(504) = 0.77) while also aiding in conceptual interpretation and statistical inference by reducing the number of comparisons. The analysis revealed three distinct dimensions across the subscales of the questionnaires(Figure 6a). Factor 1 ('Psychiatric traits') included high loadings from measures of depression, anxiety, and behavioural and social apathy,Factor 2 ('Empathy and emotional motivation') included high loadings from measures of cognitive and affective empathy and emotional apathy, and Factor 3 ('Utilitarianism') included high loadings from measures of utilitarianism-i.e., beliefs related to maximizing well-being for all.</figDesc></figure>

Relatedly, it would be interesting to examine whether and in what species the environmental influence on helping conspecifics is present.

We are often faced with decisions whether to interrupt and exert cognitive effort, such as helping out a colleague with their work whilst we have our own work to complete. Testing the boundaries of the environmental effect to different types of cost, such as cognitive or time costs is important and beyond the scope of the current study.</figDesc></figure>
