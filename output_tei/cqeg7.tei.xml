			<abstract>
				<p>Previous data suggest zero-value, neutral outcomes (draw) are subjectively assigned negative rather than positive valence. The combined observations of faster rather than slower reaction times, subsequent actions defined by shift rather than stay behaviour, reduced flexibility, and, larger rather than smaller deviations from optimal performance following draws all align with the consequences of explicitly negative outcomes such as losses. We further tested the relationships between neutral, positive and negative outcomes by manipulating value salience and observing their behavioural profiles. Despite speeded reaction times and a non-significant bias towards shift behaviour similar to losses when draws were assigned the value of 0 (Experiment 1), the degree of shift behaviour approached an approximation of optimal performance when the draw value was explicitly positive (+1). This was in contrast to when the draw value was explicitly negative (-1), which led to a significant increase in the degree of shift behaviour (Experiment 2). Similar modifications were absent when the same value manipulations were applied to win or lose trials (Experiment 3). Rather than viewing draws as neutral and valence-free outcomes, the processing cascade generated by draws produces a complex behavioural profile containing elements found in response to both explicitly positive and explicitly negative results.</p>

Principles of operant conditioning clearly express the common ways in which the outcome of current behaviour influences future action <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Thorndike, 1911)</ref>. While changing action as a consequence of negative outcome (ie, lose-shift) and repeating action as a consequence of positive outcome <ref type="bibr">(ie, win-stay)</ref> seem to be two sides of the same coin, punishment and reinforcement remain anatomically <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Thapa &amp; Gruber, 2018)</ref>, evolutionarily <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bolles, 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">West &amp; Lebiere, 2001</ref>) and mechanistically <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kubanek, Snyder &amp; Abrams, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dyson &amp; Ahad, 2021)</ref> distinct. In addition to operating in environments such as gambling and educationwhere feedback is both salient and explicitly negative or positive-there are other cases where information regarding our performance is often ambiguous or incomplete <ref type="bibr">(Müller, Möller, Rodriguez-Fornells &amp; Munte, 2005)</ref>. The interpretation of outcomes that do not have a clear valence, either as a result of the absence of feedback (ambiguous; <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gu, Feng, Broster, Yuan, Xu, &amp; Luo, 2017)</ref> or the explicit delivery of neutral feedback, such as the zero value assigned to drawing against an opponent <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dyson, Steward, Meneghetti &amp; Forder, 2020)</ref>, is a neglected feature of the decisionmaking literature.</p><p>The behavioural and neural responses following supposedly 'neutral' outcomes have provided a number of unique insights into the subjective aspects of decisionmaking. Within a simple case where three possible outcomes of a competitive interaction are assigned different values (win = +1, draw = 0, lose = -1), a draw may co-opt aspects of positive or negative outcomes as a result of the transient state of the Behavioural profiles following feedback 4 organism (see <ref type="bibr">Na, Zhang &amp; Dyson, in preparation)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">West &amp; Lebiere (2001, p. 225)</ref> express this interpretive tension generated by draws as "to tie is to fail to win, but on the other hand to tie is to avoid a loss." Thus, a draw may be perceived as worse-thanexpected in the context of not winning, or better-than-expected in the context of not losing. This need for personal interpretation means that individuals-in otherwise identical environments in which they encounter the same types and frequencies of outcomes-can form different subjective states where they experience more successes than failures (i.e., [win = draw] &gt; lose), or, more failures than successes (i.e., win &lt;</p><p>[draw = lose]). This is important for at least two reasons. First, given the inherent ambiguity of draws, these responses can speak to the degree of optimistic bias or depressive realism held as a trait <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Allan, Siegel &amp; Hannah, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cazé and van der Meer, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Sharot et al., 2007)</ref>. Second, draws play a critical component in determining gambling behaviour, since a draw could be equally perceived as either a near-win or a near-loss thereby perpetuating erroneous beliefs in performance success <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dixon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Ulrich &amp; Hewig, 2018)</ref>. Given the ubiquity of traditional operant conditioning responses to clear gains and losses (win-stay, lose-shift), it seems probable that the behavioural profile for draw outcomes has its hallmark in these more hard-wired reactions. We can start to understand the subjective interpretation of draws by comparing performance with explicitly positive and negative outcomes, in addition to reviewing the previous literature in terms of a number of metrics including decision times, neural flexibility, and, the quality and optimality of action following outcome.</p><p>With respect to decision time, we can draw from the literature on post-loss slowing / speeding (c.f., impulsivity; <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Verbruggen, Chambers, Lawrence &amp; McLaren, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Eben, Chen, Vermeylen, Billieux &amp; Verbruggen, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dyson, 2021)</ref>. Here, Behavioural profiles following feedback 5 differences in future decision time are determined by the type of outcome caused by the current action: post-loss slowing is defined as increased decision time following losses relative to wins, and, post-loss speeding is defined as decreased decision time following losses relative to wins. A contributing factor in the observation of slowing or speeding is the degree to which failure is rare <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Notebaert, Houtman, Van Opstal, Gevers, Fias, &amp; Verguts, 2009)</ref>. For example, if an individual interacts with an opponent who cannot be beaten (unexploitable), or interacts with an opponent who can be beaten (exploitable) but who the participant fails to beat, then performance is characterized by post-loss speeding. In contrast, the degree to which individuals successfully exploit an opponent increases the magnitude of post-loss slowing (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dyson, Sundvall, Forder &amp; Douglas, 2018</ref>; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). However, outcome frequency does not provide a complete account of post-loss slowing since post-loss slowing is intact when positive and negative outcomes are experienced to the same degree (eg., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Eben et al., 2020)</ref>. Previous data utilizing draw outcomes further show that when participants engage with unexploitable opponents where long-run outcome frequencies were equivalent, decision times following wins were slower than decision times following both losses and draws (i.e., post-draw speeding; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dyson, Wilbiks, Sandhu, Papanicolaou &amp; Lintag., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Forder &amp; Dyson, 2016)</ref>. Therefore, decision time speeding data establish a connection between neutral (draw) outcomes and explicitly negative (lose) outcomes.</p><p>A second metric to ascertain the subjective interpretation of draws is the flexibility of responding following outcomes. Feedback-related negativity <ref type="bibr">(FRN;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Miltner, Braun &amp; Coles, 1997</ref>) is a scalp-recorded electrical potential related to dopaminergic influences on anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Luft, 2014)</ref> and is a Behavioural profiles following feedback 6 reliable index of the positive or negative nature of trial outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Holroyd et al., 2006)</ref>. Paradigms directly using neutral outcomes have shown that FRN amplitudes generated following draws are often statistically indistinguishable from unambiguously negative (i.e., lose) outcomes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dyson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Holroyd et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kreussel et al., 2012)</ref>. In contrast, both lose and draw trials generate larger FRN amplitude than unambiguously positive trials (i.e., win; e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gentsch et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2004)</ref>. Therefore, event-related potential data also align draws with a negative rather positive interpretation.</p><p>Of final interest is the flexibility of behaviour exhibited following outcome.</p><p>Operant conditioning dictates the tendency to repeat action following success (winstay) and the tendency to switch action following failure (lose-shift). Under baseline conditions (win = +1, draw = 0, loss = -1), the degree of win-stay behaviour approximates the optimal proportion (33.3%) as predicted by a mixed-strategy-style approach guaranteeing the absence of exploitation (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dyson et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Dyson et al., 2020, Experiment 1)</ref>. In contrast, the degree of lose-shift behaviour exceeds the optimal proportion (66.6%), making participants more predictable following loss. In follow-up studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Forder &amp; Dyson, 2016)</ref>, the objective values of losses and wins was manipulated relative to baseline (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kubanek et al, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brockbank &amp; Vul, 2021)</ref>. Data produced by these schemes showed that value manipulations changed behaviour for wins but not for losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Forder &amp; Dyson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kubanek et al, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Specifically, even when the objective cost of losing was reduced to half the gain of winning (-1, +2), participants still exhibited robust lose-shift behaviour to the same degree observed in a baseline condition (-1, +1) or a condition in which the objective cost of losing was doubled relative to the gain of winning (-2, +1). In contrast, win-  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dyson et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Forder &amp; Dyson, 2016</ref>) and</p><p>neural <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gentsch et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Holroyd et al., 2006)</ref> hallmarks similar to objectively negative outcomes (losses), moving the value to +1 should be a more salient manipulation than moving the value to -1.</p><p>Changing draw value from 0 to +1 or -1, and evaluating performance against an unexploitable opponent in Experiment 1, we make the following predictions. This is guided by data from 12 previously published experiments that use a similar win Behavioural profiles following feedback 9 (+1), draw (0), lose (-1) outcome value assignment against an opponent who cannot be beaten <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dyson et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Forder &amp; Dyson, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dyson, et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Srihaput, Craplewe &amp; Dyson, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dyson, 2021)</ref>. First, reaction times following draws should be faster than reaction times following wins (post-draw speeding). Second, actions following draws should be more likely to elicit shift than stay behaviour, once again aligning with the consequences of losing rather than winning. Third, the degree to which participants stray from optimal performance should be greater for draw-shift than win-stay, consistent with the behavioural suboptimality often associated with negative relative to positive outcomes. The expected value for win-stay is 33.3% and the expected value for both lose-shift and draw-shift is 66.6%. Fourth, if draws are interpreted as negative when assigned the value of 0, changing the value of the draw to +1 (i.e., moving from subjectively negative to objectively positive) should alter behaviour more than changing the value of the draw to -1 (i.e., moving from subjectively negative to objectively negative).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Experiment 2</head><p>The data from Experiment 1 identified distinct behavioural effects that underline the ambiguities associated with draws. Draws were aligned with negative outcome in that future actions were characterized by speeding rather than slowing, and, shift rather than stay behaviour, similar to losses. However, draws did not generate identical states as losses, since the degree of shift behaviour was equivalent to MS performance in the former case. Draws were also weakly aligned with positive outcomes in that the degree of shift behaviour was constant when the value of the draw was made explicitly positive but rose (non-significantly) when the value of the draw was made explicitly negative. In Experiment 2, we focused more specifically on the hypothesis that shift behaviour should increase-away from MS performance-via the explicit assignment of draw value equivalent to losses (-1) compared to wins (+1; c.f., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">West et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>We also considered the contribution of a potentially hidden variable in Experiment 1-namely, the presence of a cumulative score. In addition to the immediate effect of adding or subtracting individual points on a trial-by-trial basis, cumulative scores provide a longer-range index of success or failure. This subjective,</p><p>Behavioural profiles following feedback 16 longer-range evaluation of outcome has support at a neural level, given the observation that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) represents current outcomes against the broader context of average task value <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Holroyd &amp; McClure, 2015)</ref>. In particular, the presence of such cumulative scores may have been particularly important in Experiment 1 exactly due to the manipulation of draw value. Since MS opponents were used in all three conditions, participants experienced a broadly equivalent number of wins, draws and losses. Therefore, the degree of success / failure was equivalent across conditions. However, when draw outcomes were assigned to non-zero values, the use of +1 guaranteed an increasingly positive score as the block progressed, in contrast to the use of -1 guaranteeing an increasingly negative score. This is clearly borne out in the data from Experiment 1: the final average score when draw = 0 was -3.00 (SE = 1.30), when draw = +1 was +39.25 (SE = 1.85), and, cumulative score (present, absent) varied. Blocks were now 90 trials (4 conditions) rather than 120 trials (3 conditions) used in Experiment 1. Participants also reported their subjective impression of each condition along a visual analog scale from total luck to total skill, as part of a larger empirical exercise to be reported elsewhere. All other parameters in Experiment 2 were identical to Experiment 1.</p></div>

Only the two-way interaction between cumulative score x outcome was significant: [F(2,70) = 5.42, MSE = 18945, p = .006, ƞp 2 = .134]. The interaction showed both post-loss speeding (384 ms) and post-draw speeding (434 ms) relative to RTs following wins (510 ms) but only in cases where the cumulative score was present (Tukey's HSD, ps &lt; .05).</p><p>Behavioural profiles following feedback 18 Reaction times when the cumulative score was present following wins were also slower than all outcomes when the cumulative score was absent <ref type="bibr">(384,</ref><ref type="bibr">372,</ref><ref type="bibr">403</ref> ms for losses, draws and wins, respectively). All other comparisons were nonsignificant, with the interaction arising from the magnitude of post-loss and post-draw speeding decreasing without cumulative score.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discussion</head><p>Across Experiments 1 and 2 we conclude that there is a minor impact of adding 1 to a neutral draw value of 0, relative to a major impact of subtracting 1. This observation is consistent with the view that losses carry twice the subjective magnitude of their objective value <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kubanek et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Yechiam et al., 2015)</ref>. However, if we carry the principle that the negativegoing modulation of value should have a greater impact than the positive-going modulation of value irrespective of the outcome in question, then increasing the cost of loss from -1 to -2 should produce a stronger effect on shift behaviour than increasing the benefit of win from +1 to +2 produces on stay behaviour. Therefore, Experiment 3 applied the same value manipulations to win and loss value, once again combined with the presence or absence of cumulative score. In these regards, this final experiment serves as a test that ambiguous outcomes (draws) are more sensitive to value manipulations than explicit outcomes (wins, losses). </p></div>

Similar profiles for draws and losses are shown in terms of a speeded bias towards shift behaviour, further implying their subjective interpretation as negative rather than positive (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cohen, Elger &amp; Ranganath, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Forder &amp; Dyson, 2016)</ref>. While our data also support the contention that responses following draws will be initiated faster than those following explicit wins, and, that draws produce a future response switch (rather than stay) bias, the experience of draws is not wholly negative. This is borne out in the logic that fast rather than slow reaction times following loss represent a self-imposed limitation on future decisionmaking time that makes automatic, sub-optimal performance more likely <ref type="bibr">(Yechiam &amp; Hochman, 2013, p. 511;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dyson et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dyson, 2021)</ref>. However, the post-draw Behavioural profiles following feedback 27 speeding observed in the current experimental series did not produce the same suboptimal performance as that observed for post-loss speeding. The average proportion of draw-shift behaviour was equivalent to that predicted by mixed-strategy performance wherein all three possible response associations between consecutive trials were equal (draw-stay ≈ 33.3%; draw-shift ≈ 66.6%). Such performance guarantees loss minimization and matches the approximation of mixed-strategy performance often observed following wins.</p><p>Moreover, draws allowed for a greater degree of behavioural flexibility relative to outcomes that were clearly marked as negative. Our data show that changing the value of draws also leads to changes in behaviour-specifically, assigning draws the value of explicit wins (+1) enabled an approximation of optimal behaviour (see above). In contrast, assigning draws the value of explicit losses (-1) lead to an increase in shift bias thereby placing the participant in a potentially precarious and exploitable competitive position (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>). These comparisons strongly suggest another way in which draws can behave like wins rather than losses. The suggestion that the draw outcome as chameleon-like in nature, however, must be tempered by additional observations. Based on a reviewer's suggestion, we examined the degree of shift behaviour following wins (+1; 61.99%) in Experiments 1 and 2 against the concomitant behaviour generated by draws (+1; 66.62%) within those same conditions. We noted a significant reduction in win-shift behavior relative to drawshift behaviour, when both categories were assigned a constant value of +1 t[75] = -3.051, p =.003. Similarly, we examined the degree of shift behaviour following losses (-1; 74.10%) in Experiments 1 and 2 against the concomitant behaviour generated by draws (-1; 73.69%), we noted a non-significant difference in lose-shift behavior Behavioural profiles following feedback 28 relative to draw-shift behaviour, when both categories were assigned a constant value of -1: t[76] = 0.292, p =.771. Our reading of these results are that draw outcomes may more readily co-opt the behavioural signatures of explicitly negative, relative to explicitly positive, outcomes when the same values are assigned. If a +1 draw does not have the exact same properties as a +1 win, then value in and of itself cannot completely predict the behavioural consequences of outcomes.</p><p>Thus, the study of neutral outcomes will continue to represent an important addition to decision-making for two reasons. First, our current data imply a cognitive flexibility following draw trials that is not triggered by more clearly valenced wins and losses. This provides a clear route to studying the subjective aspects of outcome response, and how reaction to neutral trials may be shaped by preceding trial history.</p><p>For example, we have recently shown that relative to draw-draw trials, the trial outcome sequence of win-draw causes an increase in shift behaviour whereas the sequences of lose-draw causes a decrease in shift behaviour <ref type="bibr">(Na, Zhang &amp; Dyson, in preparation)</ref>. The concomitant increase and decrease in shift behaviour appears to us as an objective manifestation of the subjective nature of signed prediction error theory <ref type="bibr">(eg, De Loof, Ergo, Naert, Janssens, Talmsa, Van Opstal &amp; Verguts, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Niv &amp; Schoenbaum, 2008)</ref>. In other words, draw trials preceded by a win are interpreted as worse-than-expected (making the draw appear more negative) whereas draw trials preceded by a loss are interpreted as better-than-expected (making the draw appear more positive). Second, introducing a third outcome (draw) requires a concomitant increase in the number of responses within the decision-making space. This is important as there are growing concerns as to the degree to which the modal use of binary decision-making paradigms severely limits our understanding of more Behavioural profiles following feedback 29 naturalistic, non-binary decision spaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Yoo, Hayden, &amp; Pearson, 2021</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr">Dabney, Kurth-Nelson, Uchida, Starkweather, Chassabis, Muno &amp; Botvinick, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In sum, mitigating the adverse emotional and cognitive consequences of negative outcomes remains an important goal in the context of education, gambling and economics. However, our data show that moving away from binary conceptualizations of outcome is critical to understanding the full palette of subjective responses elicited by decision-making. Specifically, our consideration of draws highlights the subjective aspects of decision-making, and the ways in which supposedly neutral outcomes take on the hues of more clearly valenced results. The processing cascade generated by neither being explicitly reinforced or punished produces a complex behavioural profile containing elements found in both explicitly positive and explicitly negative results. The reaction to draws appears more flexible than those produced by wins and losses, and generates a response signature that is simultaneously positive and negative, but apparently never 'neutral'.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Left column depicts proportion of shift behaviour following wins, losses and draws as a function of cumulative score presentation (score, no score) and the value of draws (0, +1, -1; Experiment 1), (+1, -1; Experiment 2), or, the value of losses (-2) and wins (+2; Experiment 3).

This was supported by the results of a twoway, repeated measures ANOVA with final score as the dependent variable. This yieldeda main effect of value [F(1,70) = 2163.64, MSE = 62.2, p &lt; .001, ƞp 2 = .969] in the absence of main effect of experiment [F(1,70) = 0.002, MSE = 47.4, p = .966, ƞp 2 &lt; .001], and in the absence of an interaction [F(1,70) = 0.231, MSE = 62.2, p = .632, ƞp 2 = .003].Although the presence / absence of a cumulative score does not play a role in the quality of decision-making, a consistent picture emerges from Experiments 2-3 in that the presentation of an increasingly positive-going / negative-going score plays a role in the speed of decision-making-namely, accentuating speeding following 'negative' outcomes. This reinforces the idea that individual moments of feedback are compared against a backdrop of historic performance (c.f.,<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Holroyd &amp; McClure, 2015)</ref>, reminding us that reactions to outcome are idiosyncratic, and influenced by the salience of both internal and external signals.</figDesc></figure>
