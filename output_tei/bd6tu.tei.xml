			<abstract>
				<p>Mental fatigue is usually accompanied by drops in task performance and reduced willingness for further exertion. A value-based theoretical account may help to explain such negative effects. In this view, mental fatigue influences perceived costs and rewards of exerting effort. However, no formal mathematical framework has yet been proposed to model and quantitatively estimate the effects of mental fatigue on subjective evaluations of effort expenditure, under possibly imperfect self-perceptions of internal fatigue states. We proposed a mathematical framework to model human cognitive effort allocations, assuming mental fatigue states are partially observable with semi-Markov dynamics. We modeled effort allocation decisions as a means to the goal of maximizing cumulative subjective values over a given time horizon. We developed an estimation method to identify subjective values and the hidden dynamics of mental fatigue, which can in future work be applied to self-reports, psychophysiological indices, and behavioral outcomes associated with fatigue. The modeling and estimation method was tested using a simulated n-back task under a free choice paradigm, with model parameters fine-tuned from past studies. The proposed approach was able to recapitulate task performance and task engagement patterns observed under mental fatigue. This work advances a reward/cost trade-off account for explaining the exertion of mental effort and suggests new avenues for both theoretically and empirically relevant understandings of how cognitive operations are affected by mental fatigue.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Mental fatigue is associated with reduced effort on demanding cognitive operations. Consequently, task performance and work efficiency tend to decline under mental fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Boksem et al., 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Boksem et al., , 2006</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hopstaken et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Hopstaken et al., 2016)</ref>. The adverse consequences of mental fatigue have been documented in a variety of settings. In an office work environment, for example, mental fatigue has been observed to reduce both typewriting speed and accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(de Jong et al., 2020)</ref>. In transportation, mental fatigue among drivers has been considered as a major cause of road accidents <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Lal &amp; Craig, 2001)</ref>. It has been estimated that 20% ∼ 30% of all road accidents and 5% ∼ 15% of fatal road accidents involve fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b132">(Razmpa et al., 2011)</ref>. In healthcare, more than 78% of health providers including physicians and nurses have reported experiencing fatigue-related burnout, which has been identified as "a public health crisis that urgently demands action" <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Jha et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Although mental fatigue has been studied formally for over 100 years, and its adverse consequences have been observed for even longer <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Thorndike, 1900)</ref>, its origin and effects are still a matter of debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Massar et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Pattyn et al., 2018)</ref>. In this manuscript we propose a mathematical framework for modeling and estimating the effects of mental fatigue on the allocation of mental effort. The guiding assumption in this approach is that humans are rational in deciding to exert mental effort in the sense that they aim to maximize subjective values <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Loewenstein et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Shenhav et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015)</ref>. Simply put, when the rewards for successful task performance exceed the perceived costs, people are inclined to put effort into the task. Otherwise, the task may be abandoned in favor of other more valued activities. We assume that mental fatigue impacts the subjective value of effort expenditure, and we report a mathematical model rooted in this perspective that may help to estimate and explain effects of mental fatigue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mental effort</head><p>Many cognitive activities are habitual and can be executed quickly and easily, but some mental operations-especially those involving cognitive control-are slower and more effortful and thus may be construed as costly. For example, encoding a single-digit number and recalling it a few moments later is a simple cognitive operation that even young children, who lack fully developed cognitive capacities, can accomplish with relative ease. By contrast, encoding a five-digit number while processing a dense passage of text and then recalling the number minutes later is a more effortful mental operation. Juggling multiple streams of information requires cognitive control to maintain the target information (i.e., the number) in working memory and to prevent it from being dislodged by competing information <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Engle, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">Unsworth &amp; Engle, 2007)</ref>. But what currency is used to pay for costly mental effort?</p><p>The costs of cognitive operations have at least two origins, namely intrinsic costs and opportunity costs. Intrinsic costs stem from the limited nature of cognitive capacity: only so much information can be processed at any given time. Such intrinsic costs may derive from limited metabolic resources or finite task-relevant information storage capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref>. Indeed, one stream of thought has suggested that suboptimal behaviors are deeply rooted in the finite nature of the brain's computational capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Gershman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Griffiths et al., 2015)</ref>. Opportunity costs arise insofar as more than one task is available to perform. Exerting mental effort on one task comes at the price of foregoing other tasks and the rewards associated with them. Most relevant to this manuscript is the assumption that the way people allocate mental effort reflects their subjective preferences and optimality principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Lieder et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b154">Vul et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The limits of cognitive capacity -whether due to intrinsic costs or opportunity costs -call for deliberate allocation of mental effort. Numerous experiments have observed that individuals adjust the level of effort they allocate to cognitive tasks according to the perceived trade-offs between taskassociated costs and rewards. For example, when allowed to choose among different tasks to perform, participants avoided more cognitively demanding tasks in favor of less demanding tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Kool et al., 2010)</ref>. Another study used an economic discounting paradigm to study subjective costs associated with different tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>. Participants were instructed to choose among a set of tasks associated with different difficulty levels and different rewards. The rewards required for choosing to perform highly demanding tasks were substantially higher than those for simpler tasks. These results revealed a reluctance to exert effort when available rewards for successful task performance fall below a subjective breakeven point.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The subjective value of effort expenditure</head><p>The difference between the perceived costs and rewards for performing a task can be construed as stemming from subjective value <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015)</ref>. Building upon the concept of subjective value, a normative model can be formulated to translate a person's behaviors into subjective preferences <ref type="bibr">(and vice versa)</ref>. Moreover, the model parameters can, in some cases, be estimated from behavioral data <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Hartmann et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Klein-Flügge et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Prévost et al., 2010)</ref>. For example, one investigation attempted to fit linear, hyperbolic, parabolic, and exponential subjective value functions to participants' choices to allocate mental and physical effort by using a maximum likelihood estimation procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chong et al., 2017)</ref>. This work yielded different models for mental (hyperbolic) versus physical effort (parabolic), a conclusion further corroborated by evidence for both domain-general and domain-specific neural substrates for coding the two types of effort.</p><p>An important strand in the literature on modeling mental exertion by subjective values relates to the expected value of control (EVC) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Shenhav et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref>, which construes the subjective value of effortful cognitive control as the sum of the value of the present state of the world and the expected future value that results from the current effort expenditures. According to the EVC model, the allocation of mental effort reflects a rational decision process whereby effort is adjusted over time to maximize subjective value. The EVC model extended a value-based decision making account by considering the consequences of current cognitive effort exertion on distal subjective values <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Chong et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Hartmann et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Klein-Flügge et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Prévost et al., 2010</ref>) .</p><p>The EVC model has been tested and validated in a handful of prior studies. For example, one study built an EVC model using a simulated flanker task <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Musslick et al., 2015)</ref>. This study validated classic findings in a sample of simulated subjects, including reduced error rates and slower reactions after erroneous responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Laming, 1968)</ref>, as well increased intensity of mental effort with increased incentives for task performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">(Padmala &amp; Pessoa, 2010)</ref>. The EVC model also has provided a useful framework for studying the plasticity of control <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Lieder et al., 2018)</ref> and the influence of affect on cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Grahek et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>However, some basic components of the EVC model are not directly observable and thus are hard to identify. For example, the value of the outcomes and the costs of cognitive control cannot be directly observed and thus the EVC model might be mis-specified, which limits the capability of the EVC model to explain empirical data. Hence, to validate the EVC framework, those model components have to be correctly identified. Although some past work has been done to obtain those basic components from experimental data <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Musslick et al., 2018)</ref>, there is still far from enough discussion on how best to identify otherwise unknown model primitives. Nevertheless, the EVC model, as we shall propose below, can be extended to incorporate and identify the effects of mental fatigue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Effects of mental fatigue on cognitive control</head><p>There is no gold standard definition of mental fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Massar et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Pattyn et al., 2018)</ref>. As mentioned previously, both common experience and empirical studies have revealed that mental fatigue is accompanied by aversion to effort expenditure, poorer task performance, and subjective feelings of tiredness <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Boksem et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Dittner et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hopstaken et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Hopstaken et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b123">Pattyn et al., 2018)</ref>. A prevailing metaphor for mental fatigue, similar to physical fatigue, is that it is induced by the depletion of energetic resources. The energetic resource has been hypothesized to be glucose in the bloodstream, which is essential for virtually all bodily (including brain) functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Fairclough &amp; Houston, 2004;</ref>. The idea is that the resource (e.g., glucose) gets used up by performing effortful mental tasks, leaving the person relatively less able to continue to exert effort until the resource has been restored. However, the resource metaphor has been challenged both conceptually and empirically. Whereas some studies found evidence that blood glucose decreases after cognitively demanding tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Fairclough &amp; Houston, 2004;</ref>, others found no global metabolic changes after mental effort expenditure <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Finley et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015)</ref>. Blood glucose levels do not vary much if at all during cognitive demanding tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Gibson, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Kurzban, 2010)</ref>. Even "resting" mental activity could be construed as metabolically costly, insofar as specific task performance hardly consumes more brain energy than does resting activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b131">(Raichle &amp; Mintun, 2006)</ref>.</p><p>As an alternative to the resource-based view, some theorists have endorsed a more motivationally-oriented perspective of mental fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Hockey, 2011)</ref>. In this view, mental fatigue alters the willingness (rather than the ability) to expend effort. This perspective has received support from studies testing the effects of external rewards on mental effort. Both monetary incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Boksem et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Muraven &amp; Slessareva, 2003)</ref> and non-monetary incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Hopstaken et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Hopstaken et al., 2016)</ref> have been found to reverse the characteristic signs of task disengagement associated with mental fatigue. Hence, even after fatigue has set in, performance and associated physiological indicators of attention control can be restored to (or near to) pre-fatigue levels by offering incentives for performance. These results supported the idea that individuals tend to invest precious cognitive capacities in tasks that yield higher rewards (compared to the costs), and increasing the value of a task (i.e., increasing motivation) makes expending effort on it more likely. In terms of subjective value, we propose that mental fatigue affects the perceived costs and rewards of mental operations and, consequently, the motivation for exerting mental effort. Changing the reward/cost balance by introducing incentives for performance can thus modulate the allocation of effort under mental fatigue.</p><p>A sound model of mental fatigue should be able to explain some crucial established empirical findings, including evidence that (a) mentally fatigued people become inclined to disengage from effortful tasks and reduce further effort exertion <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Giacomantonio et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Giacomantonio et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Hopstaken et al., 2016)</ref>; and (b) extra incentives help to offset or reverse these negative effects of mental fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Boksem et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hopstaken et al., 2015)</ref>. Below we develop a mathematical model intended to account for these established patterns. We intend the proposed approach to be used in future work to further understanding of the causes and consequences of mental fatigue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Contribution</head><p>To our knowledge, the existing literature lacks modeling and estimation methods for testing the extent to which fatigue changes during cognitive exertion, and the extent to which perceived rewards and costs of mental effort change under mental fatigue. In this manuscript we developed a quantitative model and estimation methods to examine how mental fatigue affects the allocation of effort during cognitively demanding tasks.</p><p>In the proposed model, at each decision epoch, a human subject (agent) decides the amount of effort to exert, expecting performance-related rewards in return for the costs of mobilizing mental effort. We assume that the agent chooses the amount of mental effort expenditure that maximizes total subjective value over the extended task duration, and further we assume that the fatigue state is imperfectly self-perceived by the agent. The transition between fatigue states follows a hidden semi-Markov process, i.e., the likelihood of transition to a more fatigued state is a function of the current state and the elapsed time in the current state. We take a "Bayesian brain" perspective, which postulates that the agent infers hidden causes of sensations based on generative models <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Friston, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Knill &amp; Pouget, 2004)</ref>, 1 and assume that humans rep-resent sensory information of hidden fatigue states through Bayesian belief and update the belief upon encountering new input data (a Bayesian belief is the posterior distribution over possible fatigue states, given sensory related and behavioral data). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We develop a method to estimate the parameters of the model, including the hidden fatigue dynamics and the subjective values of effort expenditure, using sensory and behavioral data as well as effort allocation decisions. We tested the estimation method via a simulated n-back task under a free choice paradigm with model parameters fine-tuned from the published literature. The aims were to identify the model primitives and to correctly predict common empirical findings such as the decline in performance and task engagement due to increased fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Giacomantonio et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Hopstaken et al., 2016)</ref>, and task re-engagement due to extra incentives <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Giacomantonio et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Giacomantonio et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hopstaken et al., 2015)</ref>. This work advances methods for explaining effort allocation decisions and provides new avenues for empirically relevant understanding of how effort expenditure is affected by mental fatigue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Review of Relevant Mathematical Background Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes</head><p>Markov decision processes (MDPs) are used to model optimal inter-temporal decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Bellman, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Puterman, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Ross, 2014)</ref>. At each decision epoch t &gt; 0, the agent observes the state of the environment s t and selects an action (makes a decision) a t . The action a t yields a reward r(s t , a t ) (depending on both state and action) and leads to a change in the state of the environment. The transition of the state is characterized in a probabilistic manner by a conditional probability P(s t+1 |s t , a t ). The agent observes s t+1 before making the next choice and so on and so forth.</p><p>Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) generalize MDPs by taking into account the fact that the states of the environment may not be perfectly observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Cassandra, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Monahan, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Smallwood &amp; Sondik, 1973)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">3</ref> Due to the hidden nature of environment states, the agent has to infer the state and makes decisions based upon all possible observed histories (including all past decisions and state-correlated noisy measurements); see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. The consequence is that the relevant history grows exponentially as more decision epochs are considered. Fortunately, for a Bayesian agent, a belief -a probability distribution over the state space -is sufficient to derive an optimal policy. The decision making process is similar to MDPs: At decision epoch t, the agent observes a hidden state-correlated observation z t and updates belief x t based on previous belief x t−1 , previous action a t−1 and z t . A decision a t is made based on x t . Upon execution of the decision a t , the agent receives a reward and its expectation is denoted by r(x, a). A transition of the hidden state resulting from decision a t is described by P(s t+1 , z t+1 |s t , a t ). The goal for the agent is to maximize the expected cumulative reward:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">E[ ∞ t=0 β t r(s t , a t )|x 0 ]</formula><p>. A six tuple (S, A, Z, P, r, β) formally defines a POMDP, where S is the set of possible hidden states, A is the set of available actions, Z is the set of possible observations, the dynamics of the hidden state is P : S × A → S × Z, and r : S × A → R is the reward function. MDPs and POMDPs have been used in modeling human behaviors -such as goal-directed decision making under uncertainty -and their biological foundations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Dayan &amp; Daw, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b142">Seymour et al., 2004)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Structure of POMDPs. At each decision epoch t, a hidden environment state s t emits a correlated observation z t . The agent makes a decision by consulting z t in addition to all past actions and observations. The hidden state s t is influenced by the selected action a t and transitions to s t+1 .</p></div>

Note that although both IRL and MDP approaches attempt to model optimal behavior in the sense of utility maximization, the two approaches are different: the goal of MDPs is to derive an optimal policy for a given (known) set of model parameters, whereas IRL assumes the optimal behaviors are exhibited in the data but the corresponding model parameters are unknown. The goal of IRL is to "learn" the parameters from the given data (hence "inverse").</p><p>to the modeling approach that describes hidden causes X and their dependent observables Y via a joint distribution P(X, Y) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Jebara, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Ng &amp; Jordan, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>2 Sensory related data may include electroencephalography, electrocardiography, pupil diameter, etc. Behavioral data may include task performance indices such as reaction times, error rates, etc.</p><p>3 In general, the environment includes both external states such as temperature and humidity, and internal states. In this work, by environment states we mean human psychological states, or more specifically, mental fatigue states.</p><p>Specifically, for a classic model-based IRL approach, the goal is to learn the reward function (i.e., the agent's relative preferences for the available options). Whereas IRL may be capable of learning human driving behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Kuderer et al., 2015)</ref>, training robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Finn et al., 2016)</ref>, and understanding other's intentions (Theory of Mind) (Jara-Ettinger, 2019), the method has shortcomings. One crucial issue overlooked by the IRL approach stems from its assumption that the agent perfectly observes the environment. This assumption is almost certainly inaccurate. Even if the environment were fully observable, human perceptions and measures are noisy and ambiguous <ref type="bibr" target="#b141">(Schmitt et al., 2017)</ref>. One study attempted to tackle this issue by developing a model to estimate the reward function in a partially observable environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Choi &amp; Kim, 2011)</ref>. However, in that work, how the state of the environment changes (i.e., environment state dynamics) was assumed to be known. This assumption was likely overly restrictive and simplistic: Changes in many subjective states (such as mental fatigue) are context dependent and influenced by individual differences and hence may not be known in advance.</p><p>Econometricians have also developed estimation methods for inferring the parameters of the agent's utility model from decision data, which are generally denoted by structural estimation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Rust (1987)</ref> authored a seminal work that extended the scope of structural estimation to MDPs by developing a nested fixed point method to estimate (completely observed) environment state dynamics and reward function, based on an agent's decision making history. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Rust (1987)</ref>, a class of dynamic discrete choice (DDC) models was developed to describe (and estimate and predict) the decision making behaviors of a forward-looking agent <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aguirregabiria &amp; Mira, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Keane et al., 2011)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hidden Markov Models and Hidden Semi-Markov Models</head><p>The class of hidden Markov models (HMMs) is a statistical framework for the Markov processes in which the environment states are unobserved. Similar to POMDPs, an observable process (observation) is available in an HMM and is dependent on the underlying hidden Markov process. The difference between HMMs and POMDPs is that HMMs do not involve actions (i.e., no decision-making process). At time t &gt; 0, the environment occupies a (hidden) state s t and the environment releases an observable signal z t dependent on s t . Moreover, the underlying s t transitions to s t+1 stochastically, following the hidden state dynamics P(s t+1 |s t ); see <ref type="figure">Figure  2</ref>. The three major goals of HMMs are: (a) to compute the likelihood of an observed data sequence {z t }, and (b) to find the most likely hidden state sequence {s t } for a given history of observations, and (c) to learn hidden state dynamics that define an HMM <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Baum &amp; Petrie, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Baum et al., 1970;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Eddy, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Mor et al., 2020)</ref>.</p></div>

In the study of mental fatigue, sojourn time may be used to characterize the amount of time an individual remains in a particular fatigue state (e.g., fatigued or not fatigued).

In this work, the fatigue state space S, the observation space Z, the action space A, and the temporal duration space D are assumed to be finite. The inter-temporal transition of both fatigue state and its duration is denoted by transition probabilities</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">{P(s ′ , τ ′ , z|s, τ, a) : s, s ′ ∈ S, z ∈ Z, τ ′ , τ ∈ D, a ∈ A}. 5</formula><p>One-step subjective value r(s, a) is the trade-off between rewards and costs for a specific decision epoch, which is a function of both fatigue state s and selected effort level a. Subjective value functions could be non-parametric or parametric (such as linear, parabolic, hyperbolic, or exponential functions of both fatigue level s and effort level a). It is possible that z t may not fully capture the information that the agent has available for decision making (e.g., the agent may possess private information that influences subjective values and decisions). We thus assume that one-step subjective value is perturbed by a random factor ϵ = {ϵ(a) : a ∈ A}, wherein the a th element of vector ϵ stands for the privately observed perturbation when the agent chooses to execute decision a. 6 See <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 4</ref> for a schematic representation.</p><p>Let ζ t = {x 0 , a 0 , z 1 , a 1 , z 2 , ..., a t−1 , z t } be the history until time t, containing all observable information including past effort allocation choices {a 0 , a 1 , ..., a t−1 } and past observations {z 0 , z 1 , ..., z t }, wherein ζ 0 = {x 0 } and x 0 = {P(s 0 , τ 0 ) : s 0 ∈ S, τ 0 ∈ D} is the agent's initial belief (self-perception) of his or her fatigue state and its duration.

Specifically, at time t+1, different observations (z t+1 ) may be emitted by the underlying hidden state s t+1 , which, together with choice taken at time t (a t ), updates the history ζ t to ζ t+1 (i.e., ζ t+1 = {ζ t , a t , z t+1 }). Moreover, random perturbation (ϵ t+1 ) may also take a different value. So there are two layers of expectation ( z t+1 P(z t+1 |ζ t , a t ), . . . dµ(ϵ t+1 )), corresponding to the expectation over observations and the expectation over random perturbations. Finding solution to Equation (2) is difficult as ζ grows exponentially with as time increases.

Compared to ζ t , the size of belief x t remains constant and does not grow to infinity as t increases (i.e., x t ∈ X, ∀t), which enables an efficient solution to Equation (2).

Under these conditions, maximum likelihood estimation can be used to find the value of θ D , θ R that jointly maximizes the likelihood function of given observable histories ζ T s.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 5</head><p>Modeling of mental fatigue and its effects on effort allocation. The Blue circle contains an abstraction of changes or transitions in mental fatigue states. The inter-temporal dynamics of both the hidden fatigue state and its duration are parameterized by θ 1 . Noisy measurements (such as behavioral or physiological data) of fatigue states are denoted by observations and are stochastically dependent on the underlying hidden fatigue state. This dependent structure is captured by P θ 2 (z|s). Decisions refer to the agent's choice of difficulty level (i.e., effort allocation) for the upcoming block of the cognitive task, which manifests a subject's preference for the level of effort to be exerted and results in changes to both fatigue state and its duration. The Yellow circle depicts our proposed model for describing mental effort allocation. The model assumes that the agent exerts mental effort to maximize the expected cumulative subjective value (immediate value plus future expected value) of successful task performance, which is determined by fatigue dynamics, observation probabilities, and one-step subjective values (parameterized by θ R ). This subjective value is a function of the fatigue state at each decision epoch. Because fatigue states and their duration are hidden, the model assumes that the agent self-perceives his or her fatigue state and its duration, described by the belief x. The Green box displays the estimation procedures for the model parameters, including fatigue dynamics (θ 1 ), observation probabilities (θ 2 ), and one-step subjective values (θ R ). Specifically, we first do partial estimation regarding fatigue dynamics (P θ 1 (s ′ , τ ′ |s, τ, a)) and observation probabilities (P θ 2 (z|s)).

They studied the effects of mental fatigue on task performance during a prolonged series of n-back tasks. The authors observed changes in task performance (measured in d-prime), physiological states (P3 amplitude, pupil diameter), and self-reports of fatigue.

As can be seen in <ref type="figure">Figure 12</ref>, increasing the number of fatigue states from 2 to 3 resulted in a marked improvement in the likelihood, whereas increasing from 3 to 4 states led to no more gain. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 4</ref> shows the AIC and BIC values for the different models, wherein the 3-state model yielded both the smallest AIC and BIC. To summarize, for a dataset generated by a 3-state model, the best estimates were achieved by a 3-state setting, which clearly outperformed a 2-state setting. Although a practitioner may not know the "true" number of underlying hidden states, he/she can experiment with different settings and select the setting with the smallest AIC/BIC value to achieve closest-totrue-model performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussions</head><p>We modeled the allocation of effort under mental fatigue as a DDC model with hidden and semi-Markov states. This model was based on reward/cost trade-offs, treated effort expenditure as capacity-limited (rather than resource-limited), and assumed that people behave rationally by seeking to maximize cumulative subjective values across the whole decision cycle. We posited that subjective value is influenced by mental fatigue and provided a way to calculate cumulative subjective values using some common assumptions. Moreover, we developed a maximum likelihood estimation procedure to identify model parameters -one-step subjective values and mental fatigue dynamics -from an agent's decisions and behavioral or physiological data. We tested the proposed estimation method with a simulated free choice n-back task composed of several blocks of trials. Simulated agents had to choose a task difficulty level for the upcoming block while taking into account the effects of mental fatigue. We fed simulation data to the estimation procedure and found high estimation precision in identifying model parameters. Further, we successfully reproduced some canonical findings from mental fatigue and decision making literature using predictions from the estimated model, including decreased task performance with increased time on task as well as increased feeling of fatigue, task re-engagement with additional performance incentives, and reduced marginal effects of further effort exertion with added incentives.</p><p>Below, we consider related work and summarize our approach's unique theoretical implications. We then envision some prospective applications that may benefit from our approach and also address some limitations of the proposed model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related Work</head><p>Some prior studies have addressed cognitive control and mental fatigue based on a reward/cost trade-off account. Those studies provided both empirical and theoretical insights into mechanisms that may account for mental effort exertion.</p><p>Here we compare the current work with prior studies to reveal the unique contribution of our approach.</p><p>Expected value of control (EVC) theory was proposed to explicate the principles of cognitive control allocation <ref type="bibr" target="#b144">(Shenhav et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b145">Shenhav et al., 2017)</ref>. We sought to build on the EVC model by incorporating the influence of mental fatigue on effort allocation decisions. In the EVC model, the decision to be made regarding cognitive control is two-fold: the identity of control (i.e., what kind of cognitive control to engage) and the intensity of control. A rational agent needs to optimally adjust these control signals to maximize expected value. A computational study illustrated the EVC model in the context of a simulated flanker task based on a one-step control allocation problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Musslick et al., 2015)</ref>. The environment state was composed of sensory stimuli, which indicated the direction of the arrows in the flanker task. The control allocation decision of the agent was assumed to be based on the inferred state (the subjective representation of task stimuli), <ref type="bibr">27</ref> and then the environment would emit an outcome (e.g., correct or incorrect response) determined by both the true state (the actual direction of the target arrow) and the subject's control decision (i.e., response). The update of automatic bias (e.g., the tendency to be influenced by flanking arrows rather than target arrows) was based on the difference between emitted outcomes (from the true state of the environment) and anticipated outcomes (from the inferred state of task stimuli), weighted by a learning rate. The model used by Musslick et al. involved a relatively short (trial to trial) time scale. In the current work, we focused on longer term subjective states (mental fatigue) that may influence effort allocation decisions. Further, differences in mathematical formulations used in the prior work and the current work can be found. Firstly, we considered the calculation of subjective values for an infinite horizon, which avoided the (possibly) overly simplified (onestep) formulation of subjective value. Secondly, we took a Bayesian brain perspective, modelling self-perception of mental fatigue as based upon the entire history of relevant observations and choices, rather than updating an inferred state (e.g., automatic bias) based on current perceptions and the difference between anticipated and actual outcomes as in <ref type="bibr">Musslick et al.</ref> EVC theory has also been applied to the study of the influences of subjective states on cognitive control allocation, such as affect. More specifically, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Grahek et al. (2020)</ref> studied the influence of affect on cognitive control by applying the EVC framework to simulated Stroop tasks. They parameterized the costs and rewards to build subjective values and based the analysis on the simulation results. In addition to the different research targets (i.e., affect versus fatigue), distinctions can be found between that work and the current model. We modeled mental fatigue as a hidden state that plays an important role in building subjective values and hidden state dynamics. <ref type="bibr">Grahek et al.</ref> indirectly studied the influence of affect. For example, to study the influence of integral affect (i.e., a type of affect that arises from task performance and related incentives), Grahek et al. increased rewards for successful performance and compared the simulation results (e.g., task performance, willingness to exert cognitive control) to a model setting with smaller task rewards. Although that approach permitted the researchers to perform simulations and compare the differences between two model settings, it also raises questions such as how to determine the appropriate magnitude of task rewards? and how to address individual differences? (because different people may react differently to the different task reward values). By contrast, we provided a way to address those questions by estimating model parameters (subjective values and mental fatigue dynamics) from experimental data.</p><p>Estimation of the cost function using the EVC model was discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Musslick et al. (2018)</ref>. They considered a onestep forward-looking formulation of EVC. In other words, cognitive control (e.g., identity and intensity) specified at time t results in some outcome that carries value at time t + 1. The optimal control policy should satisfy the first order condition by taking partial derivatives of EVC with respect to control. The derivatives contained two parts: one part was the derivative of the cost function (related to current step values), and the other part involved the derivatives of task accuracy (related to future values). Hence, by first order optimality condition, the cost function could be estimated via the derivatives of task accuracy, and those derivatives can be obtained from specific experimental designs (such as by manipulating task rewards and observing the corresponding changes in task accuracy to estimate the desired derivatives). In that work, a one-step forward-looking formulation of EVC and the implicit assumption that the values of outcomes did not depend on the current decision reduced the complexity of finding first order conditions. In the current work, the choice at time t affects future value by altering the agent's fatigue state; future value is the expected cumulative value for all decisions (at time t + 1, t + 2, ...) yet to come (rather than looking only oneperiod ahead). Our proposed estimation procedure proved able to deal with this relatively more complicated, nested form of subjective value function (hence, a recursive optimal effort allocation policy). <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Agrawal et al. (2020)</ref> proposed a model based on utility maximization to explain why people become (mentally) fatigued and bored. They proposed that fatigue and boredom bias human behavior toward more rewarding activities. In the case of fatigue, people may quit online cognitive operations in favor of offline computations (such as mental simulation) to improve the likelihood of gaining future rewards. In the case of boredom, people may quit the task at hand to search for more rewarding tasks. By specifying the agent's subjective preference (subjective utility) under different circumstances (different state-action pairs (s, a)), the model proposed by Agrawal et al. can be used to explain why and when fatigue and boredom occur. However, specifying an agent's subjective utilities is not a trivial undertaking. Our work aims directly at this issue: We estimate the agent's subjective values by their choices. <ref type="bibr">28</ref> In other words, we do not assume the reasons behind task disengagement; we only assume that mental fatigue biases behavior by altering subjective values, and we can fit our model to data to quantify such fatigue-induced biases. In addition, our model treats mental fatigue states as partially observable, allowing for noise associated with fatigue measures. Our proposed estimation procedure can still identify underlying hidden fatigue dynamics with high precision based only on noisy (imprecise) measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Theoretical Implications</head><p>The power of learning from data endows the capability and potential of the proposed approach. We begin discussion of the model's implications by stressing (a) our model is an instance of a more general estimation methodology (structural estimation of POMDPs), which needs empirical data to function, and (b) the model is not limited to a specific form of subjective value function or fatigue dynamics; it invites researchers to test and compare their theories related to the constructions of subjective values as well as the dynamics of mental fatigue. In what follows, we provide some examples of how our model can contribute to the study of mental fatigue.</p><p>Distinguish rewards from costs. In the current model, the cost of mental effort c(s, a) and the perceived reward of successful task performance b(s, a) are modeled jointly in the one-step subjective value function as r(s, a) = c(s, a) − b(s, a). The current method will identify r(s, a); however, one could parameterize the cost function c(s, a) and the perceived reward function b(s, a) using evidence from empirical studies. The model could then estimate the effect of mental fatigue on the cost and perceived reward functions separately, which could help to understand the extent to which effort allocation decisions under mental fatigue stem mainly from changes in the perceived costs of expending effort, or the perceived rewards of expending effort, or some combination of both factors. Such an undertaking could shed light on the extent to which the perceived value of rewards changes under mental fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Kelley et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Are subjective reports of mental fatigue objectively accurate? The measurement of mental fatigue usually includes both objective (e.g., task performance, physiological records) and subjective (e.g., self reports) indicators. Unfortunately, the two indicators do no not always align. Debates over the relative merits of the two indicators are common <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Holtzer et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b139">Sandry et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b153">Völker et al., 2016)</ref>. The modeling and estimation approach described here provides a possible way to address this issue: by fitting the model with objective measures (e.g., performance or physiological changes), one could compare the estimated dynamics of mental fatigue with subjective self-reports, which may help to specify the relationship between subjective and objective measurements of mental fatigue. It then will be interesting to examine for whom and under what circumstances subjective and objective indicators of mental fatigue cohere, and when they fail to cohere. We propose that research and theory on mental fatigue would benefit by identifying break points in coherence (i.e., circumstances wherein the two indicators diverge) and by identifying demographic, personality trait, or brain morphological factors that relate to coherence (or lack thereof) between subjective and objective indicators of mental fatigue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Future Applications</head><p>Our modeling and estimation procedure to identify hidden fatigue dynamics and subjective values may prove useful for both theoretical and empirical studies of mental fatigue and effort allocation.</p><p>A perspective to deal with circularity. A crucial question raised by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Botvinick and Braver (2015)</ref> regarded the mechanisms behind reward/cost trade-offs in explaining human behavior: Behavioral preferences are explained by subjective values, but subjective values, in turn, are usually inferred from behavioral preferences. The situation grows more complicated when mental effort carries costs: More effort leads to both more rewards and more costs. Hence, a clear pathway for obtaining subjective values is needed to break the circular reasoning identified above and thus ensure that "the assertion that choices maximize values becomes potentially falsifiable and thus truly scientific" (Padoa-Schioppa, 2011). Botvinick and Braver further claimed that one way to overcome the circularity is to leverage findings from neuroscience to consolidate the construction of subjective values. Relevant candidates include physiological indicators such as electroencephalography, pupil diameter, and neural activations related to effort allocation, subjective evaluation, and mental fatigue dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bartra et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Boksem et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Hopstaken et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Padmala &amp; Pessoa, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b140">Schmidt et al., 2012)</ref>. One study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that incentives can enhance task performance by improving task information coding and maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Etzel et al., 2016)</ref>. Efficiency in decoding task information was significantly higher under incentive compared to no-incentive trials. Although neural activity correlated qualitatively with incentive evaluation, one question worth probing is: How much improvement can be achieved by introducing incentives? Or similarly, how much difference does an incentive make in term of subjective values? In the study of mental fatigue, the need for such quantitative analysis exists as well. For instance, as discussed previously, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hopstaken et al. (2015)</ref> found that the promise of rewards reversed the negative effects of mental fatigue and psychophysiological indicators associated with task disengagement. But how much reversal of such negative effects can be accomplished by offering additional rewards remained unexplained.</p><p>Our modeling and estimation procedure paves a new way for the rigorous and objective quantification of subjective values based on the behavioral, neural, physiological, and decision-making outputs of the decision maker. This quantification can be achieved by incorporating neuroscientific findings into the proposed framework. For example, in a task switching paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Etzel et al., 2016)</ref>, subjective value functions could be constructed via extracted fMRI patterns (in this example, fMRI activity corresponds to cue and early delay periods). If, for the simplest case, we could parameterize subjective values by a linear function of fMRI signals, then by estimating the corresponding parameters in the linear function, we may be able to build a quantitative relationship between choice preferences and their neural correlates via subjective values. Such parameterization enables one to build subjective value functions without undertaking the risk of circularity, and to simplify the estimation of subjective value functions by focusing on a few design parameters. In addition to the parameterization of subjective value functions, our framework features a customizable module for researchers to plug in the fatigue measurements they prefer (for the modeling of observation probability), which is a (conceptually) simple computation to implement. Yet it can be supercharged by neuroscientific advancements: More reliable fatigue measures lead to less noisy observations, which in turn enhance precision in the estimation of fatigue dynamics and subjective values. For example, recent years have witnessed the emergence of non-intrusive physiological measurements (such as smart wearables) of people's health status, which provide abundant observable data that could facilitate fatigue estimation. Researchers have already begun to realize the potential of smart phone or smart wearable data in assessment and monitoring of psychological states <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Kodithuwakku Arachchige et al., 2021)</ref>. Specifically, vital signs such as heart rate and heart rate variability, which may be tracked via smart watches or bands, are useful in predicting mental fatigue (H. <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Luo et al., 2020)</ref>. Further, eye blink data can be collected using smart glasses and may also contribute to detecting mental fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Horiuchi et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Our model may take the advantage of aforementioned technology breakthroughs and help researchers answer quantitative questions such as "how much performance gain can be achieved for a given incentive?" Lastly, our model is capable of describing within or across individuals variations in the mapping from neural correlates to subjective values, which will be discussed in the next section. Simply put, with a sufficient amount of data, our model can be fitted separately for different individuals as well as groups of people, which may facilitate the study of individual level and group level perceptions of subjective value.</p><p>Individual differences. Individuals differences in personality traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Braem et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Jimura et al., 2010)</ref>, age <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Ennis et al., 2013)</ref>, and clinical disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(Marx et al., 2013)</ref> are likely to impact subjective values <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015)</ref>. Differences in subjective values may predict differential willingness to allocate mental effort in daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>. One study of cognitive control using a 2-step decision making model found significant individual differences in the the tendency to incorporate goal-related contextual information in decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b119">(Otto et al., 2015)</ref>. Such individual differences likely play a role in effort allocation decisions as well. Age is another likely moderator of mental effort allocation; it is possible that aging alters the perceived costs of expending mental effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>. In the study of mental fatigue, individual perceptions play an important role as well. Evidence has suggested that older people may be influenced by mental fatigue in a different manner compared to young people, and older people may fatigue more quickly and suffer greater performance decrements compared to young people <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Arnau et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Our model provides a way to study the influence of such individual differences: The estimation procedure can identify the one-step subjective values (and thus, reward function and cost function parameters) and fatigue dynamics for each individual or group. By comparing estimation results across individuals or groups, one could attempt to quantify the influence of the individual difference of interest. Furthermore, a counterfactual analysis (i.e., comparing what actually happened against what would have happened under different conditions) could be used to predict individual differences in reward/cost sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Braem et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Engelmann et al., 2009)</ref>. Our model is able to easily simulate changes in incentives and observe the consequences of such changes, which could then be tested (verified) in experiments with human subjects.</p><p>Perceptions of effort and mental fatigue may be important also for understanding some clinical disorders. The perceived costs of expending effort may relate to specific clinical conditions. People with depression or schizophrenia may experience more effort related costs compared to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">(Westbrook et al., 2013)</ref>. Fatigue descriptions in clinical practice are various and have different emphases in different contexts: some focus on both physical fatigue and mental fatigue (e.g. chronic fatigue syndrome, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Pattyn et al. (2008)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">Shen et al. (2006)</ref>) whereas others may stress mental fatigue in particular (e.g., insomnia, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Pattyn et al. (2008)</ref>); some can be alleviated by sleeping <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Mairesse &amp; Neu, 2016)</ref> whereas others are more acute and may not be improved by rest <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Hossain et al., 2003)</ref>. Furthermore, the intensity of perceived fatigue may differ across individuals with underlying clinical conditions. As mental fatigue is a multi-faceted construct, it is unlikely that one particular measure can precisely and comprehensively capture the a person's level of mental fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Pattyn et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Our model introduces a novel way for clinical studies to approach effort expenditure and mental fatigue. In addition to having the capacity to incorporate relevant physiological and self-report measures of mental fatigue, our model infers subjective values from behavioral choices. In clinical conditions that implicate effort deficits, analysis of subjective values has proved successful in predicting symptoms such as substance abuse, obesity, and problem gambling <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015)</ref>. In the evaluation of mental fatigue in clinical populations, a "transactional model" of fatigue has been proposed to measure levels of mental fatigue based on the patient's experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b122">(Pattyn et al., 2008</ref>). The proposed model suggests a practical implementation of this idea by fitting our mental fatigue model to each individual patient, resulting in a unique clinical profile capturing personal effort exertion willingness and changes in willingness due to mental fatigue. The potential exists for this approach to help tailor treatments to individuals for mitigating effort-and fatiguerelated decrements.</p><p>Controllability and task performance. It has been proposed that work performance depends on both how demanding a task is and the degree of controllability the person has over his or her activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Hockey, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Hockey &amp; Earle, 2006)</ref>. Empirical results have suggested that people may sustain relatively high levels of work performance without reporting fatigue if they are allowed to arrange the work at their discretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Frese, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Karasek Jr, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">Wall et al., 1996)</ref>. In a more recent study, Hockey and Earle built a simulated office work environment wherein the workload was characterized by both time pressure and controllability (of task schedule). Under high workload, only the low controllability group exhibited negative effects on work performance and fatigue.</p><p>Our model provides a way to study individual preferences for Demand × Control interactions. An adapted free choice paradigm permits an agent to allocate effort by distributing workloads to specific periods of time. Assuming that a decision maker behaves rationally and thus, given a defined workload and a specific time span, optimally allocates effort based on subjective values, researchers would be able to quantify how subjective values change as the agent grows more fatigued and how the agent maintains a balance between work progress and the negative effects of mental fatigue. This balance is important because it marks the optimal effort allocation strategy (for the agent) and can be explained by a compensatory control model <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hockey &amp; Earle, 2006)</ref> such that the discrepancy between work goals and effort exertion are reconciled. The interpretation from our model would be that the agent adjusts his or her fatigue state by altering the allocation of effort, thereby keeping fatigue levels in an acceptable range with economically optimal trade-offs between costs and rewards.</p><p>Dissociation of choice dimensions. Dissociability is an important concept in decision making and neuroeconomics. Both the delay of rewards and the uncertainty of receiving rewards conspire to reduce subjective values. Generally speaking, more delayed rewards and less certain rewards are valued less than their sooner or more certain counterparts. How can one be certain whether delay or uncertainty is responsible for an observed discounting of rewards? Further, how might we distinguish discounts induced by effort from discounts induced by delay or uncertainty? If these discount factors cannot be dissociated, then effort-based decision making may be just another form of delay-or uncertainty-based decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">(Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015)</ref>. Researchers have designed different experimental paradigms to dissociate the costs of effort from the costs from delay or uncertainty. In the current work, we have introduced fatigue as another potential factor that may serve to discount subjective values. Moreover, although not addressed in the current model, factors other than fatigue could influence the subjective evaluation of task values, including such as negative moods or boredom <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Chiew &amp; Braver, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Pattyn et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Pessoa, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b152">van Steenbergen et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>As the number of the variables that influence subjective values increases, it becomes harder to dissociate their effects by pure experimental design techniques. Our model opens the door to dissociate effects of different variables via mathematical optimization of the likelihood of data: The variables of interest can be included in the reward/cost functions and estimated. For example, agents may manifest both "overload" (limited cognitive capacity) or "underload" problems (often described as boredom) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Hancock &amp; Desmond, 2001)</ref>. It has been argued that although both types of problems represent a form of fatigue (sometimes described as active fatigue and passive fatigue, respectively), they have different mechanisms. It may be informative to examine the discounting mechanisms associated with overloads and underloads -by parameterizing subjective value as a function of both passive and active fatigue -to understand how they influence subjective values that may explain the agent's effort allocation behaviors. We intend our model to be used in the future research to untangle the processes underlying the outcomes of mental fatigue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Simplifying assumptions revisited. In the Simulated Nback Tasks with Changing Fatigue section (above), we illustrated our method via a simulated n-back task under the assumption that choosing to perform the harder task hastens fatigue (which is supported by prior studies, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Blain et al., 2016)</ref>. This assumption was linked to the idea that the agent earns the reward associated with the task only if their performance surpasses a threshold presumed to entail some degree of mental effort (particularly when the more difficult task was chosen). If the agent expends little or no effort on the difficult task, then it is likely that no reward is earned; the simpler task would have been the more rational choice. Nevertheless, human agents do not always make rational decisions. Another assumption we made was that choosing to perform easier tasks restores mental fatigue, though this assumption also may not hold in all circumstances. For example, tasks that do not entail much mental effort, instead of restoration, may be prone to elicit boredom. We cannot rule out the possibility that agents will grow bored, rather than or in addition to mentally fatigued, when performing n-back tasks. In fact, a previous study of reward sensitivity and boredom found it hard to fully decouple fatigue and boredom <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Milyavskaya et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>To be sure, our model does not present an exhaustive analysis for each possible scenario. The aforementioned assumptions were adopted only for illustrative purposes and are based on prior evidence consistent with the assumptions. Such assumptions influence the ways we parameterized fatigue dynamics and subjective value functions, but the same estimation procedure would still apply to obtain those estimates. Furthermore, one could also fit the data under different assumptions to see which assumptions best explain observed behaviors, thereby providing a way to test the validity of the assumptions. This consideration represents another example of how researchers can use our model and estimation methods in future work to advance research and theory on mental fatigue.</p><p>Concerns arising from the rationality assumption. Our proposed model may serve many future studies of mental effort and mental fatigue, though the model carries the inherent liabilities of the reward/cost trade-off framework. One concern is the assumption that people behave rationally <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Rust, 1994)</ref>. In many scenarios, people may act based on local contexts by comparing available options rather than evaluating all possible options. As a result, the relative values of different options may change with the immediate task environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Delgado et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b151">Tversky, 1969)</ref>. In our proposed model, the agent is assumed to evaluate the subjective values for each option and select the option with the highest subjective value (i.e., act independent of bias induced by local contexts). Another potential issue is that people may have difficulty evaluating the subjective values of states that are not currently occupied <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dayan, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Loewenstein &amp; O'Donoghue, 2004)</ref>. For example, a person may underestimate the difficulty of being on a diet when he or she is currently not hungry. If a relative incapability to predict non-occupied states is a general principle in mental effort allocation, then our proposed model may not be able to provide satisfying explanations or predictions for people's behaviors, because we assumed that human agents are rational and can objectively evaluate the values of future outcomes rooted from current state and choice selection.</p><p>Affect and effort allocation. Our current work focused on the "cognitive" side of mental fatigue and its effects, leaving the "affective" side relatively untouched. Emotions (or affects, used interchangeably from here on) are ubiquitous and play an important role in human decision making, whether or not people are aware of their influence. However, how emotions influence decision making is still under debate. Different theories have been proposed. For example, some researchers have posited a valence-based approach (to what extent an emotion is experienced as positive/negative matters <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Han et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Loewenstein &amp; Lerner, 2003)</ref>) whereas others have proposed an arousal-based approach (the intensity of emotions matters <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Kaufman, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Sohn et al., 2015)</ref>). Some theorists believe a two-dimensional description of emotion is far from enough <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Mellers et al., 1998)</ref> and have proposed an appraisal-tendency framework, which posits that emotion is a multi-dimensional construct and carries motivational factors that bias decision making depending on both qualitative properties (which type of emotion) and quantitative properties (the intensity of such emotion). We notice that, while being attributed to different reasons/mechanisms, different theories of emotion share a common feature: emotions carry value that can influence decision making. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">Lazarus and Lazarus (1991)</ref> further argued that different emotions are related to different "themes" in assessing the value of events.</p><p>Following the assumption that emotions carry value, our model may prove useful for studying the influence of emotions on decision making. The relevant state space in the model can incorporate both fatigue and affective states. As a result, subjective values would be a function of both fatigue and affective states; The temporal dynamics would describe the joint transition of those two states across time. Implementing such a model is not a trivial undertaking and was not the main focus of our present work, but the role of affect in shaping subjective value represents a novel route for future research to build on the model we have proposed. Another promising avenue for future work may be to consider compensatory mechanisms that help to sustain good performance under mental fatigue. A similar compensatory mechanism has been proposed to understand high performance in the context of cognitive and emotional stressors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">Pavlidis et al., 2016)</ref>, and it seems reasonable to assume that similar mechanisms exist to combat mental fatigue. These ideas represent possible applications of our model in the study of joint effects of mental fatigue and affect on decision making. Because our approach is an instance of the structural estimation of POMDPs, one would need to deliberately design model parameters and experiment settings to unveil the power of the model (because it is meaningless to train a highly mis-specified model).</p><p>If, as discussed above, affect carries value, then some behaviors considered "irrational" by outsiders (not the decision maker) may actually be rational to the decision maker him/herself, in the sense that they contribute to subjective value. Our model is capable of dealing with hidden states, and thus may help rationalize decision making behaviors by quantifying the values of such hidden values.</p><p>Modeling of temporal delay discounting. Delay discounting, which is related to but potentially distinct from effort discounting, has long been of interest to researchers in the study value-based decision making. Delay discounting accounts for the phenomena whereby a distal reward (to be obtained in the future) is less valuable compared the same amount of reward that can be obtained right now. A common finding, which is referred to as the amount effect, is that larger subjective values will be discounted less than smaller values <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Green et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Thaler, 1981)</ref>. Individual differences have also been observed in delay discounting rates: People who perceive higher costs tend to more heavily discount future values.</p><p>In the current work, we assumed that subjective values are discounted by β, which implies the proportionality of delay discounting does not depend on the amount of the subjective value. This assumption may not be appropriate for modeling future subjective values (i.e., it does not adequately account for the amount effect). And it seems to be reasonable to relate such amount effects to delay discounting mechanisms. Furthermore, recent studies have found that temporal delays may discount subjective value hyperbolically <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Frederick et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Green &amp; Myerson, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Laibson, 1997)</ref>. In comparison, our model assumes an exponential discounting mechanism, suggesting that the discounting proportion of subjective values is determined by a discount factor β to the power of the duration of temporal delay t (β t ). A worthwhile future research direction would be to incorporate different delay discounting mechanisms into the proposed model and compare which mechanism fits data better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We modeled the effects of mental fatigue on effort allocations based upon a reward/cost trade-off account. We posited that mental fatigue influences effort allocation decisions by altering subjective values. We provided an estimation method to identify mental fatigue dynamics and subjective values from experimental data. Our proposed model successfully verified mental fatigue related phenomena such as performance drops, task disengagement, and re-engagement with additional incentives. Further, our work offers the potential for advancing understanding of human effort allocation under mental fatigue, including estimation of individual differences, differentiating clinical conditions associated with compromised fatigue manifestations, investigations of neural underpinnings corresponding to mental fatigue and its influ-ences on subjective value representations, and dissociability studies to isolate the effects of mental fatigue from multiple other determinants of subjective value. Collectively, our work, rooted in extant decision making theories and prior studies of mental fatigue, unleashes a promising future of quantitative study of mental fatigue by harnessing the advantages of both empirical research and mathematical methods.</p></div>

(2020)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Smallwood and Sondik (1973)</ref>. Let ζ t+1 = ζ ′ , ϵ t+1 = ϵ ′ . Assume g t+1 (ζ ′ , ϵ ′ ) = V t+1 (x ′ , ϵ ′ ), then at time t, σ(x, a, z ′ ) V t+1 (λ(x, a, z ′ ), ϵ ′ )dµ(ϵ ′ ) ,</p><formula xml:id="formula_37">= V t (x, ϵ).</formula><p>where the second equation is by P(z ′ |ζ, a) = σ(x, a, z ′ ) and</p><p>x ′ = λ(x, a, z ′ ). □</p><p>Identification of fatigue dynamics. We explain the identification of the dynamics of fatigue states and their duration times as follows. Such dynamics is defined by {P θ D (s ′ , τ ′ , z|s, τ, a) : s, s ′ ∈ S, τ, τ ′ ∈ D, a ∈ A} (parameterized by θ D ). Both reduced form observation probability and updated Bayesian belief depend on P θ D and are denoted as σ θ D , x t,θ D , respectively. Given that</p><formula xml:id="formula_38">σ θ D (z t+1 , x t,θ D , a t ) a function of θ D =P(z t+1 |ζ t , a t )</formula><p>from data , whereP(z t+1 |ζ t , a t ) is a function of data, one would expect that θ D could be identified by matching σ θ D with empirical probabilitiesP(z t+1 |ζ t , a t ). To test this idea, consider the first period data {x 0 , a 0 , z 1 }:</p><formula xml:id="formula_39">σ θ D (z 1 , x 0 , a 0 ) = s 1 ,τ 1 s 0 ,τ 0 x 0 (s 0 , τ 0 )P θ D (s 1 , τ 1 , z 1 |s 0 , τ 0 , a 0 ) = s 0 ,τ 0 x 0 (s 0 , τ 0 )P θ D (z 1 |s 0 , τ 0 , a 0 ) =P(z 1 |x 0 , a 0 )<label>(9)</label></formula><p>The issue is that Equation (9) is not enough to uniquely determine P(s t+1 , τ t+1 , z t+1 |s t , τ t , a t ): It is possible that there exist θ D θ ′ D and (s t+1 , τ t+1 ) such that P θ D (s t+1 , τ t+1 , z t+1 |s t , τ t , a t ) P θ ′ D (s t+1 , τ t+1 , z t+1 |s t , τ t , a t ) but P θ D (z t+1 |s t , τ t , a t ) = P θ ′ D (z t+1 |s t , τ t , a t ). In this case, consider two periods of data {x 0 , a 0 , z 1 , a 1 , z 2 }. We show that for two dynamics of fatigue θ D , θ ′ D :</p><formula xml:id="formula_40">θ ′ D = θ D ⇐⇒ x 1,θ D = x 1,θ ′ D ,<label>(10)</label></formula><p>where "⇐⇒" stands for "if and only if". "=⇒": is trivial to see. "⇐=": Since</p><formula xml:id="formula_41">x 1,θ D (s, τ) = s 0 ,τ 0 P θ D (s 1 = s, τ 1 = τ, z 1 |s 0 , τ 0 , a 0 )x 0 (s 0 , τ 0 ) σ θ D (x 0 , a 0 , z 1 ) ,</formula><p>where x 0 is given and σ θ D (x 0 , a 0 , z 1 ) = σ θ ′ D (x 0 , a 0 , z 1 ) = P(z 1 |ζ 0 , a 0 ), ∀x 0 , a 0 , z 1 . Thus, if x 1,θ D = x 1,θ ′ D , then θ D = θ ′ D . Furthermore, we claim that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">x 1,θ D = x 1,θ ′ D ⇐⇒ σ θ D (x 1,θ D , a 1 , z 2 ) = σ θ ′ D (x 1,θ ′ D , a 1 ,<label>z</label></formula><p>2 ). (11) "=⇒": holds because x 1,θ D = x 1,θ ′ D =⇒ θ D = θ ′ D (Equation.(10)). "⇐=": holds because <ref type="figure">1 , τ 1 , a 1 )</ref>x 1 (s 1 , τ 1 ).</p><formula xml:id="formula_43">σ(x 1 , a 1 , z 2 ) = s 2 ,τ 2 s 1 ,τ 1 P(s 2 , τ 2 , z 2 |s 1 , τ 1 , a 1 )x 1 (s 1 , τ 1 ) = s 1 ,τ 1 P(z 2 |s</formula><p>Note that P θ D (z 2 |s 1 , τ 1 , a 1 ) = P θ ′ D (z 2 |s 1 , τ 1 , a 1 ) is guaranteed by first period of data. If the second period of data is also matched, i.e.,</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">σ θ D (z 2 , x 1,θ D , a 1 ) = σ θ ′ D (z 2 , x 1,θ ′ D , a 1 ) =P(z 2 |ζ 1 , a 1 ), then x 1,θ D = x 1,θ ′ D .</formula><p>Hence, by matching two periods of data, Eq (10), (11) hold and P θ D (s ′ , τ ′ |s, τ, a) can be uniquely determined, or identified. □ Identification of one-step subjective values. We illustrate the identification of one-step subjective values in the case of ϵ being multivariate i.i.d Gumbel. Hence the CCP has the closed form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">π(a|x) = exp Q(x, a) a ′ exp Q(x, a ′ )</formula><p>.</p><p>Consequently, we have the mapping from the difference in Q(x, a) (compared to a reference action a 0 ) to the difference in CCP (compared to a reference action a 0 ): π(a|x) π(a 0 |x) = exp(Q(x, a) − Q(x, a 0 )).</p><p>Note that:</p><p>Q(x, a 0 ) = r(x, a 0 ) + β</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">z ′ σ(x, a 0 , z ′ ) log a ′ exp Q(λ(x, a, z ′ ), a ′ ) = r(x, a 0 ) + β z ′ σ(x, a 0 , z ′ )Q(λ(x, a, z ′ ), a 0 ) + β z ′ σ(x, a 0 , z ′ ) log a ′ exp Q(λ(x, a, z ′ ), a ′ )</formula><p>− Q(λ(x, a, z ′ ), a 0 ) , by the fact that log N i=1 exp(x n ) = c + log N i=1 exp(x n − c). Since the dynamics of fatigue state and its duration are identifiable, {x t } t&gt;0 can be calculated for each sample path and π(a|x) is obtainable from the data. Consequently,</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">z ′ σ(x, a 0 , z ′ ) log a ′ exp Q(λ(x, a, z ′ ), a ′ ) − Q(λ(x, a, z ′ ), a 0 ) = z ′ σ(x, a 0 , z ′ ) a ′</formula><p>π(a ′ |λ(x, a, z ′ )) π(a 0 |λ(x, a, z ′ )) can be estimated from data (note x ′ = λ(x, a, z ′ )). Since the subjective value sfor a reference choice {r(s, a 0 ), s ∈ S} is known, the expected cumulative subjective value function Q(x, a 0 ), x ∈ X can be uniquely determined by contraction mapping theorem (and so do Q(x, a), a a 0 , by using Eq. (12)). To find subjection values r, we simply use:</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">r(x, a) =Q(x, a) − β z ′ σ(x, a, z ′ ) log a ′ exp Q(λ(x, a, z ′ ), a ′ ),</formula><p>where r(x, a) = s x(s)r(s, a). Hence, r(s, a) can be identified by solving a set of equations containing different beliefs. □</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 4</head><label>4</label><figDesc>Structure of proposed model.
