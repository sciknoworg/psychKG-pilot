			<abstract>
				<p>People often must plan for the worst. They purchase product warranties, insure their homes, and proactively make backup plans. People should be willing to pay more to hedge against bad outcomes that are more likely to happen. Across 14 studies (N = 5,591) we find that decisionmakers instead behave as though they almost fully ignore probability information when hedging against bad outcomes. As a result, they dramatically underinvest in hedges they are likely to need, while overinvesting in those that are unlikely to be helpful. This behavior occurs in both abstract settings (e.g. hedging lotteries) and naturalistic ones (e.g. buying warranties or insurance), occurs with fully incentive-compatible decisions, and is robust across a wide range of probabilities and outcomes. In our studies, we test a variety of possible explanations. Ultimately, we find support for an account in which decision makers focus almost solely on the bad outcome they are hedging against, while ignoring how likely that bad outcome is to occur. Interestingly, when the same participants invest to make a good outcome better (rather than hedge to make the bad outcome less bad), they were sensitive to probabilities. Leveraging this result, we find that a reframing of hedges which makes them appear more like investments can make hedging decisions better calibrated to the likelihood of an outcome.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Sometimes in life, things go wrong. Cars break down, electronics fail, events are rained out, people get fired and natural disasters happen. While there is a vast literature investigating how people value and approach the chances of obtaining a good outcome (e.g., investing time and money into a company that may succeed), much less is known about how people protect themselves against things that may go wrong (e.g. investing in a backup plan in case the company goes under). In this paper we investigate how people approach situations in which they can mitigate a bad outcome and make it less bad.</p><p>A hedge is a situation in which a person takes action to minimize a potential loss in the face of uncertainty. Here we use "hedge" to refer to the broad class of situations in which people can make an inferior potential outcome less bad. Doing so could entail taking a financial position that is negatively correlated with an existing position to reduce risk. But, it could also involve non-financial hedges such as completing extra credit assignments prior to taking a final exam to ensure a better grade even if the exam is failed. Hedges can be against actual losses, such as buying insurance on a cell phone, or against non-gains, such as keeping the option to do a postdoctoral fellowship open while applying to faculty positions. 1 Hedging decisions can be small, such as bringing an umbrella in case it rains, or large, such as purchasing earthquake insurance. Because hedging decisions are so prevalent, it is important to know whether people hedge wisely. In this paper, we find strong evidence that they do not. Decision-makers tend to spend too many resources (e.g. money, time, effort) on hedges that are rarely needed while not spending enough on hedges that are more likely to be useful.</p><p>What does it mean to hedge wisely? Different individuals may value hedges differently because of factors such as variations in wealth, but for a given individual some sensible principles can be outlined. First, all else equal, a reasonable person should value hedges with larger payouts more than those with smaller payouts. A person should be willing to pay more for car insurance that will replace their car in full in the event of an accident than insurance which would replace only the engine. Second, all else equal, a reasonable person should value a hedge more when a bad outcome is more likely to occur. For example, a person living on a fault line should be willing to pay more for earthquake insurance than the same person living in the seismically-unexciting Netherlands. Further, one could argue that the amount they are willing to pay should be proportional to their chances of needing that hedge. Normatively, given that the expected value of a hedge is the product of the chance that it is useful and the magnitude of its payout, valuations of equally-sized hedges should follow the perceived probability of the hedge being useful. Returning to earthquake insurance, all else equal, if a person lives in an area with a 10% annual chance of an earthquake, they should be willing to pay substantially more than if they lived in an area with only a 0.1% chance of an earthquake, because the expected value of the insurance is 100 times larger. 2 While we do not anticipate people will exactly value hedges according to their expected value (see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gonzalez &amp; Wu, 1999)</ref>, we believe there are reasons to expect that people may deviate to a dramatic degree from hedges' expected value, leading to substantially suboptimal decisions.</p><p>While there is very little basic research investigating how people hedge, we are aware of three cases where researchers directly investigated whether people's behavior is in line with the logic of hedging. These papers broadly suggest that the way people approach hedges is at odds with the conceptualization of hedges as tools to reduce uncertainty. First, <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Markle and Rottenstreich (2018)</ref> endowed participants with a 50-50 gamble awarding $10 if they won and $0 if they lost. The authors then offered those same participants a chance to either increase the winning outcome to $15 or instead increase the losing outcome from $0 to $5. At odds with the notion that most people are risk averse, they found a substantial number of participants preferred doubling down on the gamble rather than hedging against risk. This behavior is difficult to explain if people correctly perceive hedges as a means of reducing risk. Even more concrete evidence that people may simply not understand the logic of hedges is provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Frederick et al. (2018)</ref>, who offered participants a chance to buy both gambles and their complementary hedges. If people perceive hedges in terms of risk reduction, then those who dislike risk more would be willing to pay less for risk-increasing gambles, and more for the accompanying riskreducing hedges. Instead, Frederick et al. found the opposite-those valuing bets more highly (implying risk-seeking) also value perfect complementary hedges of those bets more highly (implying risk-aversion). <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Newall and Cortis (2019)</ref> documented similar economically inexplicable behavior in a high-stakes sports betting situation involving the English Premier League. The authors posited that, "at least some of these observed cases […] may be due to an inability to comprehend the logic of hedging -rather than alternative economic explanations."</p><p>Taken together, these three papers suggest that people do not appear to understand the key defining characteristic of hedges, namely, that they are complementary to bets.</p><p>While there is limited research directly on hedges in general, there is quite a large literature on how people value a specific type of hedge: insurance. Research in this field has broadly found that people reliably pay too much for some types of insurance and not enough for others <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kunreuther &amp; Pauly, 2006)</ref>. This finding is in large part due to people misestimating the risks that they are insuring against. For example, people overestimate the chances of easy-tovisualize, dramatic events with more media coverage (e.g. death by homicide) while underestimating the likelihood of less vivid events (e.g. dying of stomach cancer; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Combs &amp; Slovic 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Lichtenstein et al., 1978)</ref>. This behavior can result in people being willing to pay more for life insurance against death from "any disease or accident" (two easy-to-imagine outcomes) than for life insurance against "any reason" for death (a broader category, but one that is less easy to visualize; Sunstein 2002). Additionally, it is well-known that people typically do not differentiate between extremely unlikely and very unlikely events <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kunreuther et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Viscusi et al., 1987)</ref>. Because insurance is typically bought for low probability events, this lack of differentiation results in overpaying for certain kinds of insurance. Overall, the insurance literature suggests that people may not be very sophisticated regarding valuing hedges. However, due to characteristics specifically related to insurance (e.g. ambiguous, small probabilities) it is difficult to generalize insurance-behavior to hedging more broadly.</p><p>If insurance decisions and hedging behaviors in general do not appear to follow the theoretical logic underlying hedges, then what might decision-makers consider instead when making hedging decisions? A constellation of findings in the general decision-making literature suggests that people may tend to focus less on the probability of a bad outcome being hedged against, and more on its consequences. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Huber et al. (1997)</ref> presented participants with naturalistic decisions in which they could effectively hedge a risk (e.g. investing in additional capacity for a surge in demand that may or may not occur). The authors found that people rarely sought information on probabilities when it was not already provided but did search for worst-case plans. A mindset focused on bad outcomes is not necessarily surprising: it has been documented that losses or negative events take more attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Yechiam &amp; Hochman, 2013)</ref>, provoke stronger anticipatory and anticipated emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Kermer et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Sokol-Hessner &amp; Rutledge, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Phelps et al., 2014)</ref>, and are prioritized by decision-makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rozin &amp; Royzman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979)</ref>. Similarly, people have been found to be less sensitive to-or even fully ignore -probabilities when dealing with affect-rich outcomes, instead focusing on minimizing the worst-case outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rottenstreich &amp; Hsee, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sunstein &amp; Zeckhauser, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Suter et al., 2016)</ref>. This result is consistent with the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ryan, Baum, &amp; Evers (2024)</ref>, who reported that given a chance to improve a probabilistic outcome, people seem to naturally consider obtaining a bad outcome and use the accompanying negative emotions to inform their behavior 3 . Decision-makers consider how the bad outcome would feel without also considering how likely the bad outcome is to occur in the first place. This research suggests that bad outcomes may loom large in people's considerations, while the likelihood of those bad outcomes is often not as salient (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sunstein, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate how people value hedges against bad outcomes in wellcontrolled situations where the probabilities of these outcomes occurring are fully known. We investigate a full range of probabilities from small (as with small probability insurance decisions)</p><p>to large (such as making backup plans). We use a variety of different settings ranging from quite controlled and quantitative (e.g. incentive-compatible hedges against losing a bet) to more naturalistic settings (e.g. buying a warranty on electronics or completing extra credit worksheets to improve a course grade). We find that people's valuations of hedges are extremely poorly calibrated to the probability of these bad outcomes occurring. Consequently, they dramatically 3 It is also consistent with one of the experiments in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Frederick et al. (2018)</ref>, where the researchers provide participants with the opportunity to improve their chances of winning from 20%, 40%, 60%, or 80% to 100% -effectively, a perfect hedge. Notably, participants pay similar amounts for all of these changes, even though some are much more likely to be useful than others.</p><p>undervalue hedges that they are likely to need and overvalue hedges that are unlikely to be useful.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Present Studies</head><p>In what follows, we first document that people hedge suboptimally, investigating hedging behavior across a variety of contexts and varying features of the task to test a number of possible mechanical and psychological explanations (Studies 1a-1f, and a variety of studies in the Web Appendix). In Study 2, we then test whether suboptimal hedging behavior is purely due to difficulties in evaluating probabilistic outcomes or specific to hedging. We do so by employing mathematically equivalent hedging and investment decisions in an incentive-compatible setting.</p><p>We find that the severe suboptimal behavior is purely limited to hedging decisions, where participants are improving the worse outcome, but not present in investing decisions, where participants are improving the better outcome. In Study 3, we vary both the probabilities and outcomes of hedges/investments and find that for both hedges and investments, participants are highly sensitive to variation in outcomes. However, while participants are sensitive to variation in probability when investing, they appear to fully neglect these probabilities when hedging.</p><p>Finally, in Studies 4a and 4b we test a possible intervention to make hedging behavior closer to optimal behavior by reframing the hedge as an investment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Open Practices Statement</head><p>All studies except for Studies 1a-c, 1e and 1g were preregistered.

For any studies with pre-registered exclusion criteria, we also report the analyses and results including the full sample in the Web Appendix. We intentionally used very strict exclusion criteria to ensure that participant inattention did not contribute to our results. Our results are not meaningfully affected by including or excluding participants, and statistical results are presented both with and without exclusions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1</head><p>Study 1 consists of nine different sub-studies that examine how people value hedges as the probability of that hedge being useful is varied. In each study, participants saw a situation in which they had a chance of receiving one of two different outcomes and were then asked how much they valued improving the inferior outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1a</head><p>Study 1a explores hedging behavior by asking participants to state their valuations of hedges of simple lotteries as the probability of winning those lotteries varies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We recruited 201 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) who completed the study in exchange for payment. The participants completed three trials in random order. Each trial asked them to imagine that they were entered into a lottery that paid out $10 if they won, and $0 if they lost. The participants' chances of winning were varied between trials to be either 20%, 50% or 80%. The participants then used a slider scale to indicate how much they were willing to pay to improve the inferior outcome so that they would receive $2 instead of $0 (i.e., a hedge). <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref> illustrates an example of the trial in which the participants had a 20% chance of winning $10. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Illustration of Study 1a Stimuli</head><p>Note. An example of the information presented to the participants in the 20% win probability trial.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The average willingness to pay (WTP) for each of the three hedges is presented in Panel 1 of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. As illustrated by the flat green line showing the participants' average WTP, the participants were willing to pay approximately $0.70 to hedge against a loss, regardless of their actual chances of losing. The participants' valuations were not just slightly suboptimal-they appear almost entirely insensitive to the probability of the hedge being useful. When the participants had a 20% chance of winning $10, the hedge was four times more valuable than when the participants had an 80% chance of winning $10. However, the participants were willing to pay slightly less for the hedge in the 20% scenario than for the hedge in the 80% scenario. To help illustrate this discrepancy, the light blue line in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> represents the expected value of each of hedge. As shown, the participants dramatically overvalued the hedge in situations where they were already likely to win and thus unlikely to use the hedge; however, they undervalued the hedge when the chances of winning were low. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> We were surprised by the degree to which the participants behaved as though they were insensitive to probabilities and the extent to which their resulting decisions were suboptimal.</p><p>Consequently, we conducted a number of replications and extensions of Study 1a to increase our confidence in this result. These studies first rule out participant inattention or lack of understanding. We then probe possible moderators or boundary conditions of this effect to establish that our finding is not a result of some specific characteristics of the stimuli that we presented to the participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Studies 1b-1i</head><p>Studies 1b-1i are all variations of Study 1a. They were designed to ensure participant attention and understanding, and that the results of Study 1a are generalizable to other contexts including varied domains and probabilities. These studies also tested a variety of potential boundary conditions or moderators of the effect. Due to the large number of studies and explanations tested, we report the design and results in brief here. For additional details on each study's sample and experimental results, please see <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Full write-ups of all studies can be found in the Web Appendix Section 1. Study 1b was a direct replication of Study 1a. In Study 1c, instead of valuing hedges for gambles, the participants indicated their WTP (or willingness-to-work) in several real-life situations in which people hedge (e.g., buying car insurance). Both of these studies replicated the findings of Study 1a, with people valuing all the hedges within a particular situation similarly and seemingly almost fully ignoring their actual chances of needing the hedge. The findings of Study 1c exclude the possibility that this pattern of behavior is limited to only monetary gambles.</p><p>Because the behavior documented in Studies 1a-1c struck us as so dramatically suboptimal, 5 Studies 1d and 1e focused on ensuring participant attention and comprehension. Are participants simply not paying attention to the probabilities of the hedge, or do they pay attention but just not incorporate these probabilities into their decisions? To answer this question, Study 1d forced participants to attend to probabilities. Before reporting their WTP for the hedge, the participants were first asked to report how often they would win and lose the lottery on average if it were played out 100 times, in order to ensure that they understood the lotteries and the accompanying chances of winning and losing. This intervention did not change participant responses relative to a basic hedge condition without these questions. We replicated this finding in Study S1, reported in the Web Appendix, using the naturalistic scenarios from Study 1c. Next, we tested whether, despite attending to probabilities, participants could not translate those probabilities into the actual expected value of the hedge. In Study 1e, we used an even more heavy-handed manipulation: after the participants indicated their WTP, we presented them with the expected value of the hedge and explained how it was derived, and we then asked them their WTP again. Despite these changes, we again replicated the suboptimal behavior in Study 1a.</p><p>These two studies exclude the possibility that this pattern of suboptimal behavior is solely caused by participants not noticing or failing to understand the implications of probabilities.</p><p>Studies 1f-1i further tested the robustness of this pattern to various moderators, alternate formulations, and boundary conditions. Study 1f tested whether there was something special about the losing outcome being zero (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Incekara-Hafalir et al., 2021)</ref>, and presented the participants with a variety of non-zero outcome hedges (e.g., changing the worse outcome from losing $4 to losing $2, or from gaining $2 to gaining $4). Study 1g added a condition in which participants were presented with verbal probabilities rather than numeric ones (e.g., "very likely to win" instead of "80%") to introduce the ambiguity often present in real-world decisions., which has previously been found to influence insurance decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hogarth &amp; Kunreuther 1995)</ref>.</p><p>Study 1h tested the effects of making probabilities more concrete by making the outcomes the results of die-rolls rather than direct probabilities (e.g., "win if a 6 gets rolled"). Study 1i used smaller probabilities of bad outcomes (e.g., 1%, 3%, etc.), similar to the magnitudes of probabilities that participants might more frequently encounter naturalistically when they are hedging against unlikely bad outcomes. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, none of these changes appeared to meaningfully alter the pattern observed in our previous studies-only Study 1h had a (very minor) statistically significant effect on participants' valuations. Taken together, these studies show the generalizability of the effect we find and exclude a range of possible explanations for why participants value hedges in such a suboptimal manner. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>

The mean valuations of hedges in Studies 1a-1i, plotted by the probability of winning (i.e. receiving the better outcome) for each trial.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Across nine studies employing a wide variety of designs and outcomes, we reliably observe substantial deviations from optimal valuations of hedges. The participants valued hedges virtually identically regardless of whether those hedges were very likely to be useful or were almost always useless. Importantly, the situations documented thus far do not involve participants being marginally off from the expected value, paying slightly too little or too much for some hedges. The participants were often willing to pay either more or the same amount for hedges that were up to four times less valuable. Furthermore, Studies 1a-1i tested hedging behavior in a wide variety of situations, allowing us to rule out a range of possible artifactual explanations and demonstrate the robustness of this pattern. Next, we turn to a study that examines whether this pattern persists in an incentive-compatible setting and that directly contrasts participants' behavior when improving the worse versus better outcome of a pair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 2</head><p>Study 2 made three main advances over Studies 1a-1i. First, it was made fully incentivecompatible using the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) method. Second, we presented the participants with a clear, physical visualization of the probabilities and payoffs of the hedges which has been found to improve decision-makers' understanding of probabilistic decisions and increase sensitivity to probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fox et al., 2024</ref><ref type="bibr">, Padilla et al., 2015</ref>. Third, Study 2 introduces a different benchmark to assess the participants' valuations of hedges. The behavior documented in Study 1 is clearly suboptimal, but to compare behavior to the expected value is to hold participants to an unreasonably strict standard; people cannot be expected to behave perfectly in accordance with expected value calculations. Thus, while the pattern in Study 1 seems to diverge significantly from the expected value, it would be useful to give participants problems that are structurally similar, with identical payoffs and probabilities, but that are not hedges. Behavior in such problems provides a better standard against which to compare participants' hedging behavior. For this reason, Study 2 employs both an investing condition, in which participants can improve the winning outcome of a lottery, and a hedging condition, in which participants can improve the losing outcome. This design exploits the natural symmetry between hedges and investments and allows us to create mathematically equivalent decisions where the only key difference is whether the participant is changing the losing or the winning outcome. If participants behave as though they are more responsive to probabilities when improving the winning outcome, but not the losing outcome, we can be confident that the pattern observed in Studies 1a-1i is specific to hedging and is not a feature of these probabilistic tasks in general.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We recruited 213 students on the campus of a business school of a large public university on the American West Coast who completed the experiment in exchange for payment. Due to the cost of this study, we preregistered using a sequential analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lakens, 2014)</ref>. We excluded six participants who gave answers that could not be interpreted, and four participants whom research assistants (unaware of the study's hypothesis) observed violating the procedure of the survey (e.g. two participants who discussed their answers together despite instructions not to), ultimately leaving us with 203 participants for the final analyses. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Prize Wheel Used in Study 2</head><p>Note. This picture shows the experiment in action -the prize wheel is spinning, and the participant (far right) is waiting to learn what prize he will receive. The example participant in this photograph is one of the authors of this paper, thus, their identity has been anonymized for peer review.</p><p>We set up a prize wheel whose segments corresponded to different cash prizes in a prominent thoroughfare on campus (see <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>). All participants were endowed with $1 and they were told that this money was theirs to keep but that they could use some of this money to potentially increase their winnings from the wheel. The BDM method was then explained to them, and the participants completed two practice rounds to ensure that they understood the method (see the Web Appendix for the exact instructions; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Becker et al., 1964)</ref>. Next, the participants were informed that they would be asked whether they wanted to spend some money to influence the outcomes of six different lotteries, after which one lottery would be played out for real using the prize wheel. The participants then completed a set of three hedging trials and three investing trials, with the trial order randomly counterbalanced between participants. The hedging trials were similar to those used in Study 1a; participants faced a lottery with a 20%, 50%, or 80% chance of winning $5, otherwise they would receive $0. Using the BDM method, the participants could bid on increasing the losing outcome from $0 to $1. The investing trials followed a very similar design, but the participants could instead bid on increasing the winning outcome from $5 to $6. In essence, the participants made the same three mathematically equivalent decisions twice: in both hedging and investing, the participants valued a 20%, 50%, or 80% chance of receiving an additional dollar.</p><p>After the participants indicated their bids, we randomly selected one of the six trials to be played out for real. Using the BDM method, experimenters determined if a participant's bid was accepted and, if so, changed the outcomes on the wheel. The participant then spun the wheel and was awarded whatever dollar amount the wheel landed on. 6</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>, the pattern of valuations for hedges resembled the patterns documented in Study 1. The hedge valuations (in green) are very similar across the different probabilities of winning. This was not the case for the complementary investments (in purple), where valuations rose as the probability of the investment paying off increased. Here, the same participants-as the study was totally within subjects-behaved significantly more in line with <ref type="bibr">6</ref> The participants completed surveys on paper. To minimize any transcription errors, paper copies of the surveys were independently input into spreadsheets by two separate research assistants or the first author.

Interestingly, although these students explicitly learned how to calculate expected value and consider financial decisions in their coursework, they showed the same pattern as those in other majors. 7</p><p>We report a number of additional studies in the appendix showing the robustness of this effect. Appendix Study 2a presented participants with the opportunity to switch from one lottery to another, with the trials constructed such that some were economically equivalent to hedging trials and others were equivalent to investing trials. This design allowed outcomes to be framed neutrally, avoiding any possible effects of labeling outcomes as "winning" or "losing". 8</p><p>Nonetheless, we find participant behavior that is identical to that in Study 2. The effect also persisted when we highlighted probabilities as in Study 1d (Appendix Study 2b), and it was replicated in non-incentive-compatible studies with both between and within-subjects designs (Appendix Study 2c &amp; Appendix Studies 2d and 2e). The key result of the fully within-subjects Appendix Study S2d is shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>, as it shows the distribution of valuations across lotteries with a wide range of outcome probabilities and confirms that participants behave as though they are insensitive to probabilities throughout. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Willingness to Pay for Hedges and Investments in Study S2d</head><p>Note. Error bars are +/-1 SE.</p><p>Study 2, combined with Studies S2a to S2d, demonstrates that participants take probabilities into account when investing to improve a good outcome, however, they are much less sensitive to probabilities when hedging to improve a bad outcome. However, it is not clear if this insensitivity when hedging is specific only to probabilities or applies to every aspect of the hedging decision. To investigate this question, we next examine participants' sensitivity to not just the probabilities of hedges and investments, but the outcomes of those hedges and investments as well.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3</head><p>Thus far, our studies have varied the probability of bad outcomes and have found that participants are sensitive to changes in probability when investing to improve a better outcome, but insensitive to probabilities when hedging to improve an inferior outcome. This behavior could be consistent with one of two different accounts. First, it is possible that due to the aversiveness of considering negative outcomes, decision-makers are simply paying less attention to any objective information about the problem, and instead are relying more on their feelings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Zeelenberg et al., 2008)</ref> If this is true, participants who are hedging (vs. investing) will be less sensitive to differences in probabilities and less sensitive to differences in outcomes. A second possibility is suggested by research on the attention-grabbing, affectively charged nature of bad outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Rozin &amp; Royzman, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kermer et al., 2006)</ref>, and the finding that when choosing between one of two affect-rich probabilistic negative outcomes, decision-makers prioritize minimizing the worst-case outcome and ignore probability <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Suter et al., 2016)</ref>. If this is true, then, when hedging, people would be expected to pay attention to the consequences of the hedge but not the probability of needing the hedge.</p><p>Hence, there are two clear, competing predictions: under the first account, decisionmakers should be less responsive to differences in both probabilities and the sizes of outcomes when hedging relative to investing. Under the second account, decision makers should be less responsive to differences in probabilities when hedging versus investing, but similarly responsive to differences in the size of the hedge or investment. Study 3 tests these two accounts against one another by varying both probabilities and the size of the improvement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>We recruited 404 participants from Prolific Academic who completed the study in exchange for payment. After excluding participants who failed either of two preregistered attention checks, 283 participants remained for the final analyses.</p><p>We employed a 2 (hedge versus investment) X 3 (win probability: 20%, 50%, or 80%) X 3 (size of improvement: $2, $4, or $8) design. The first factor, whether subjects valued hedges or investments, was between subjects. The other two factors were within subjects. Therefore, each participant saw either nine hedging trials or nine investment trials. In each trial, the participants were asked to imagine that they had been entered into lotteries that paid out $10 for a win and $0 for a loss. They were then asked their WTP to increase either the winning or losing outcome by a certain amount. The trials varied in terms of the probability of winning the lottery (20%, 50%, or 80%) and the size of the improvement gained by hedging or investing (a $2, $4, or $8). Thus, in the investing trials, the participants indicated their WTP to increase the winning outcome from $10 to $12, from $10 to $14, or from $10 to $18, while in the hedging trials, the participants indicated their WTP to increase the losing outcome from $0 to $2, from $0 to $4, or from $0 to $8.</p><p>All participants saw every possible combination of probabilities and improvement sizes in random order.</p><p>If the participants in the hedging conditions are less sensitive to information in general, we would expect their WTP to be less responsive to changes between trials in both probabilities and outcomes. If instead, the participants neglect probabilities when hedging (but not outcomes), we would expect to see smaller changes in valuations as probability changes for hedging trials compared to investing; however, for participants who are hedging and participants who are investing, we would expect them to be responsive to changes in the outcome size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and Discussion</head><p>The results are summarized in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. <ref type="figure">Figure 6A</ref> shows participants valuations of hedges (green lines) by win probability of the trial, broken down by the size of the improvement (line brightness), and <ref type="figure">Figure 6B</ref> shows the same information for investments (purple). As shown, this study replicates our earlier findings with participants being relatively unresponsive to probabilities in the hedging condition but not in the investing condition. </p></div>

Error bars are +/-1 SE.</p><p>This result is confirmed by a mixed effects linear regression with random intercepts by participant. We regress the WTP per dollar expected value onto the hedge vs. investment condition (-0.5.= hedge, 0.5 = investment), probability of a trial's change being useful, and their interaction. We find a significant and positive coefficient on the interaction term, similar to that seen in Study 2 (b = 4.17, t(2262)=13.19, p &lt; .001; without exclusions: b = 4.10, t(3206)=13.56, p &lt; .001). 9 The participants were more responsive to the probability of the change they were paying for being useful when investing than when hedging.</p><p>To test whether the participants in both the hedging and investing conditions were responsive to the size of the improvement on offer, we regressed WTP onto probability, the size of the improvement, and their interaction. We found that people paid more for larger improvements (b = 0.26, t(2261)=9.42, p &lt; .001; without exclusions: b = 0.24, t(3205)=9.85, p &lt; .001) 10 , a result that provides strong evidence for probability neglect, rather than a general indifference to all types of information.</p><p>One hedging trial can have a higher expected value than another either because the probability of the change being useful is higher, or because the size of the change itself is greater. To roughly illustrate participants' difference in sensitivity to differences in the probability of winning versus in the size of the improvement, we examine how participants' respond differently to hedging trials with identically sized changes in expected value stemming from differences in probabilities, relative to those stemming from differences in the size of improvements. A hedge when there is a 20% chance of winning is worth four times as much as the same hedge when there is an 80% chance of winning. Similarly, a hedge that increases outcomes by $8 should be worth approximately four times as much as a hedge increasing an outcome by $2 if probabilities are the same.</p><p>Despite this difference, in the first case participants pay similar amounts of money for each hedge -$1.62 to hedge the lottery with a 20% chance of winning and $1.72 to hedge the lottery with an 80% chance of winning (for the $2 improvement). However, in the second case, the participants paid much more money for the more valuable hedge -$4.35 for the $8 increase and only $1.62 for the $2 increase (for a lottery with a 20% chance of winning). Clearly, the participants were much more sensitive to differences in one source of value (the size of the hedge itself) than they were to the other (the likelihood that the hedge would be useful). 11</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In Study 3, the participants who were investing were sensitive to both probability and the size of the potential improvement. However, those who were hedging were drastically more sensitive to the differences in the size of the improvement than to probabilities. This behavior is consistent with the account we propose: when hedging, people primarily consider how bad the bad outcome would feel and how much they are willing to give up to improve that outcome.</p><p>Thus far, we have documented that people value hedges quite suboptimally, and that this effect is very robust. Despite varying a wide range of features of the decision context, none of these changes led to improved decisions. Even seemingly heavy-handed manipulations such as forcing participants to write out all of the probabilities involved (Studies 1d and S1), or explicitly presenting participants with the expected value of a change (Study 1e), failed to make them account for differences in probabilities. Next, we attempt to remedy this issue in two studies that develop interventions designed to make participants more sensitive to probabilities when valuing hedges.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4</head><p>The battery of studies in 1a-1i found that participant's insensitivity to probabilities when hedging persisted in a wide variety of situations. However, participants were sensitive to probability when making mathematically similar decisions that involved changing the better outcome in the pair (investing), instead of the worse outcome (hedging). This pattern was robust, appearing both in an incentive-compatible setting (Study 2) and with varied improvement sizes and probabilities (Study 3). Because hedges are the mathematical complement of investments, participants' success with these decisions suggests a potential intervention: making hedges look and feel more like investments.</p><p>Studies 4a and 4b feature a manipulation that reframes a hedge as being more like an investment. If participants struggle with the logic of hedges, but understand the logic of investments, then making hedges feel more like investments should lead their decisions to be better calibrated when valuing hedges.</p></div>

After excluding participants who answered any of four comprehension check questions incorrectly, 133 participants remained for the final analyses.</p><p>This experiment employed two conditions: a basic hedge condition, and an investment reframing condition. The participants in both conditions were presented with a series of lotteries, and they were asked their WTP to change a losing outcome of $0 to $2 for three trials where they had a 20%, 50%, or 80% chance of winning $10. In the basic hedge condition, this is all that the participants were shown. However, participants in the investment reframing condition were also presented with additional text describing how the hedge could be thought of as an investment. Specifically, we added two lines of additional text to the end of the trial informing the participants that they could think of this change in outcomes "as an investment," where they give themselves a certain chance (the chances of losing the lottery and, thus, using the hedge) of receiving $2 that they did not have before. If making hedges seem more like investments helps the participants understand the logic of hedging, then this change should make hedge valuations more responsive to probabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The results are displayed in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. In the basic hedge condition (dark green line), we again found that the participants' valuations of hedges were largely insensitive to the probability of losing. However, when those same hedges were reframed as investments (light green line), the participants became much more responsive to probabilities, paying more for the hedges that were more likely to matter, and less for those that were unlikely to be useful. We confirmed this finding through a linear regression of WTP per dollar expected value of the trial onto the win probability of the trial, the condition (investment reframing = 0.5, basic hedge = -0.5), and their interaction. <ref type="bibr">12</ref> We found a negative coefficient on the interaction term, implying that the participants were more responsive to the probability of winning a trial when hedges were reframed as investments (b = -1.15, t(264)=3.21, p = .002; without exclusions: b = -0.49, t(400)=3.51, p &lt; .001).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The results of Study 4a suggest that decision-makers' natural focus on negative outcomes can be overcome. A reframing that encourages participants to narrowly focus on the hedge as providing a new potential positive outcome leads them to be more responsive to probabilities. As a result, participants' WTP is more in line with expected value, and their participants' tendency to undervalue low-probability hedges and overvalue high-probability hedges is muted. Study 4b extends this finding by testing the manipulation in a naturalistic consumer context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 4b</head><p>Study 4b had two advances over Study 4a. First, the participants saw a hedge that applied to a much more common consumer context: buying cell phone insurance. Study 4a successfully changed hedging behavior by reframing hedges, but the abstract setting (lotteries) was likely to have been unfamiliar to the participants (for an example of differences in preferences when choices are framed as insurance versus gambles, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hershey et al., 1982)</ref>. Second, Study 4a involved participants hedging against a non-gain (a gamble with a $0 outcome), while Study 4b had them hedge against a loss (i.e., a cell phone breaking). The participants in Study 4b saw an actual advertisement for a phone warranty, and decided whether they would purchase that warranty. The warranty was either presented to the participants neutrally (i.e., as a hedge), or reframed as an investment. We expected that compared to the neutral framing, the investment reframing would lead the participants to display greater sensitivity to the actual value of the warranty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>We recruited 2,396 participants from Prolific Academic who completed the study in exchange for payment. After excluding participants who failed one of two comprehension checks asking them to identify the amount of the warranty and the chances of their phone breaking, 2,227 participants remained for the final analysis.</p><p>The participants were presented with an advertisement for a phone warranty, slightly modified from an actual online advertisement used by a larges phone warranty sales company. 13 This experiment had a 2 (control advertisement text versus investment reframing) X 2 (10% chance for the phone to break versus a 30% chance) between subject design, for a total of four conditions.</p><p>The advertisement first stated the percentage of smartphone owners who had experienced damage to their phone in the past year -either 10% or 30% of owners depending on the condition-and it indicated that the warranty would cover up to $250 in repairs. In the control condition, the advertisement ended with a neutral message: "Purchase peace of mind" ( <ref type="figure">Figure 8A)</ref>; in the investment reframing condition, it ended by reframing the purchase: "It's like purchasing a [10%/30%] chance of getting $250" <ref type="figure">(Figure 8B</ref>).</p><p>Below the advertisement, the participants were presented with a scenario that asked them to imagine that they had purchased a phone for $1,000 and were now considering purchasing cell phone insurance for the terms listed in the advertisement. The participants were then asked to indicate their maximum WTP for the advertised warranty on a slider scale from $0 to $300. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 9</ref>. We tested the effectiveness of the intervention with a linear regression of WTP per dollar EV of the warranty purchase onto the condition (0.5 = investment framing, -0.5 = control), the chance of the phone breaking, and their interaction. The interaction term between the investment condition and the chance of the phone breaking was negative, such that the participants in the control condition increased their WTP less as the chances of the phone breaking increased than did those in the investment reframing condition (b = -0.01, t(2223)=3.03, p = .002; without exclusions: b = -0.01, t(2389)=3.07, p = .002). 14 This trend is clearly visible in the raw pattern of results when unpacked by condition. When the warranty was presented in the control condition, the participants paid similar amounts or only slightly more for the warranty if they had a 30% (vs. 10%) chance of their phone breaking (M10% = $61.80, SD10% = $55.4, M30% = $67.60, SD30% = $57.20, b = 0.29, t(1141)=1.74, p = .08; without exclusions: b = 0.32, t(1213)=1.96, p = .050). 15 However, this difference was considerably greater when the warranty was reframed as an investment (M10% = $50.4, SD10% = $51.50, M30% = $64.30, SD30% = $55.60, b = 0.70, t(1082)=4.27, p &lt; .001; b = 0.73, t(1176)=4.59, p &lt; .001), with the participants being much more responsive to probability. 14 Our preregistered analysis was mistakenly described as a mixed effects regression; however, with only a single trial per participant, this type of regression is not mathematically possible.</p><p>15 These statistics are the result of regressing the WTP per dollar expected value on the chance of the phone breaking within the subset of data in that condition. The fact that the statistic is larger in the control condition than in the investment framing condition effectively implies that the participants made choices more in line with the expected value in the investment framing condition, as the interaction confirmed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Taken together, the results of Studies 4a and 4b highlight how reframing a hedge as an investment can lead participants to be more sensitive to expected value. This increase in sensitivity occurred both when the participants considered gambles and when they considered the real-world case of cell phone insurance. Notably, this investment reframing appears to work even though it is not literally transforming the decision into one in which participants are doubling down on improving the good outcome (as in Study 2). Instead, it effectively encourages participants to narrowly bracket the hedge. Thus, rather than focusing on the potential bad outcome against which they are hedging, this intervention may nudge participants to instead focus on the better potential outcome that purchasing a hedge creates. The relevant common feature shared by these two situations (doubling down in Study 2, and narrowly bracketing the hedge in Study 4), is that they both encourage people to focus on a good outcome. Participants' increased sensitivity to probability in both cases strongly suggests that this focus on good, instead of bad, outcomes is the key causal force that leads decision-makers to be better calibrated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Across four sets of studies, we found consistent evidence that participants suboptimally valued hedges. Their valuations were not just slightly off; rather, they behaved as though they fully ignored the probabilities of a bad outcome occurring. This pattern emerged when participants considered stylized stimuli (i.e., gambles or lotteries) and when they considered more naturalistic prospects (i.e., buying a warranty or car insurance). Furthermore, in several studies we presented participants with clear visual representations of the chances of different outcomes occurring. In one of these studies, participants' decisions were fully incentivized.</p><p>These features did not alter the suboptimal pattern of valuations. Moreover, we found evidence that the same participants-in a fully within-subjects design-appeared to be sensitive to the probability of a good outcome, yet were nonetheless insensitive to the probability of a bad outcome (Study 2). Participants' valuations were also sensitive to changes in the magnitude of both good and bad outcomes (Study 3). Across all studies, we documented severely suboptimal hedging behavior. The fact that this pattern was so robust naturally leads to the question of where it originates.</p><p>From the outset, several potential processes seemed plausible. If hedges are inherently difficult to understand, then increasing understanding by making stimuli easier to comprehend (e.g., using die rolls in Study 1h), or explaining and calculating expected value <ref type="bibr">(e.g.,</ref><ref type="bibr">in Study 1e)</ref> should lead to a more reasonable pattern of valuations. On the other hand, if a lack of attention to probabilities accounts for this behavior, then asking people to report how often they would use the hedge if the situation was played out 100 times should improve valuations (Study 1d). If the pattern emerges only when non-gains are transformed into gains (i.e., when participants can change a $0 outcome into a $2 outcome), then varying whether the initial outcome is a loss, a non-gain, or a gain-as in Study 1f-should attenuate the pattern. We ran each of these variants; none of them modified the suboptimal pattern of valuations. In total, we tested over 20 different permutations of our basic paradigm; none of these permutations meaningfully altered the pattern shown in Study 1a, with one exception. When hedges were explicitly reframed to mimic investments, participants' decisions appeared better tethered to probabilities. Before discussing why this investment frame meaningfully altered behavior, we first consider a naturally complementary question: why were participants' valuations of hedges were so suboptimal?</p><p>We propose that consumers considering hedges may be disproportionately focused on how it would feel to realize an inferior outcome. In turn, this focus crowds out the consideration of how likely those outcomes are to occur in the first place. This process is consistent with the logic present in existing work on the avoidance of negative outcomes in decision-making. For example, people are typically more motivated to avoid bad outcomes than they are motivated to attain good outcomes of equal objective value <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baumeister et al., 2001)</ref>. In a similar vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ryan, Baum and Evers (2024)</ref> found that people naturally focus on the extent to which an improvement leads to a reduction in bad outcomes, as opposed to an increase in good outcomes. We believe that a similar psychology dictates consumers' valuations of hedges: consideration of the consequences of the bad outcome obscures consideration of how likely it is to occur in the first place. That is, consumers focus on the bad outcome and ask themselves a simple question: "How much am I willing to invest to make this potential bad outcome better?" This psychology is consistent with <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hogarth and Kunreuther's (1995)</ref> finding that consumers rarely mention the probability of a product breaking as a reason for purchasing a warranty, but they frequently mention the consequences of a product breaking (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kunreuther et al., 2001, and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Sunstein 2002)</ref>. Further, our own Study 3-in which participants' valuations were highly sensitive to variations in outcomes but not probabilities-provides evidence consistent with this process.</p><p>A focus on negative outcomes crowding out considerations of probabilities also explains why the investment reframing increases sensitivity to probabilities. When hedging, the space of possible outcomes is divided into a superior outcome and an inferior outcome. In our studies presenting participants with the opportunity to hedge gambles and lotteries, we believe that participants naturally compare the inferior $0 outcome with the superior $10 outcome-a negative counterfactual. The investment reframing changes this comparison. Rather than naturally facilitating a comparison across outcomes, it draws attention to a comparison within the same outcome: receiving $2 instead of $0-that is, a positive counterfactual. We believe that this change in the nature of the comparison (the hedge being relatively worse across outcomes, but relatively better within the outcome) is the crucial difference between these two logically equivalent situations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Practical implications</head><p>One of the most common hedging opportunities that consumers encounter in the marketplace is the option to purchase insurance or a warranty. Based on our research, one would predict that consumers will make these decisions poorly. However, insurance markets are not always characterized by the blatant over-and under-spending that we observe in our paradigms.</p><p>Why is this the case? In reality, some market forces create guardrails that protect consumers from their own biases (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bhattacherjee &amp; Dana, 2024)</ref>. Insurers compete on price and, all else equal, consumers prefer cheaper insurance. This competition should reduce the price of those kinds of insurance that are less likely to be needed by consumers and, thus, cost less to insurers .</p><p>In turn, menus of insurance prices do not allow consumers the opportunity to display the extent to which they suboptimally value such hedges. This logic has been experimentally verified by <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Camerer and Kunreuther (1989)</ref> using a market simulation paradigm. These authors found that while buyers initially valued insurance well above its expected value, over time, the buying and selling prices of insurance slowly approached the expected value. When there is sufficient competition between those who sell hedges, errors in buyers' valuations of hedges may be less consequential (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Thaler, 1994, p. 159)</ref>. In summary, while purchasing insurance is perhaps one of the most frequent hedges that consumers make, studying insurance markets may not provide researchers with a more general understanding of how individual consumers approach hedges.</p><p>The behavior that we observe in our studies suggests that when market forces do not compel competition between sellers, as in insurance markets with little competition, consumers may seriously misallocate funds. This phenomenon is likely to occur in situations where consumers are offered a hedge that complements a risky purchase such as an airline offering travel insurance, a tax preparer offering audit insurance, or an electronics store offering warranties. Consumers who are presented with a warranty offer for a computer or smartphone are unlikely to consider the probability that they will need that warranty, giving retailers the opportunity to charge well above the warranty's expected value. While the overall profit margins for insurers tend to be low (e.g., between 2% and 3% according to a 2022 US Health Insurance Industry Analysis Report), the profit on warranties offered by electronics stores is estimated to be over 50% <ref type="bibr">("The Warranty Windfall", 2004)</ref>. This amount represents a staggering surplus gained at the expense of consumer welfare. For an individual consumer, this loss may be small, but the accumulated loss of welfare is likely to be substantial.</p><p>Potential welfare losses this large highlight the need for interventions that cue consumers to make wiser hedging decisions. Supplemental Study 4 tested one possible intervention for a common hedge with little market competition: purchasing flight insurance from an airline. We asked 396 participants to imagine that they were buying a ticket from San Francisco International to Chicago O'Hare. The cost of the flight was $378.10 and the cost of the insurance was $24.58 (both prices were taken directly from the United Airlines website). Sensitivity to the expected value entails purchasing this insurance only if there is at least a 7% chance of actually using the insurance and being reimbursed in full-likely much higher than the actual chances of this insurance being useful. We first asked all participants if they wanted to purchase this insurance.</p><p>Then, each participant estimated his or her chances of needing to use the insurance, and we used this estimate to reframe the insurance as an investment. For example, if a participant estimated a 5% chance of using the insurance, we would explain how they could see their purchase of the insurance as a 5% chance of receiving $378.10. We found that the participants likely overestimated the chances that they would need the insurance (i.e., on average, they estimated that there would be an approximately 4% chance of needing the insurance). Nonetheless, the simple investment reframing reduced insurance take-up from 46.97% to 40.40%, a relative reduction of approximately 14% (McNemar's Test: X 2 (1, N = 396) = 9.77, p = .002). Notably, in contrast to debiasing tools that provide participants with new, external information (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">McKenzie and Liersch, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abito &amp; Salant 2019)</ref>, this intervention used only the participants' own internal estimates to reframe the prospect. These reframings are important: conventional wisdom suggests that it is wise to buy insurance against potential dangers.</p><p>However, there is a real risk that people end up overinsured, wasting money on coverage that they are unlikely to ever need. These overinsurance expenditures could leave them without cash in hand when confronting other, unplanned-for, financial disasters (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rabin &amp; Bazerman, 2019</ref>).</p><p>Insurance and warranties are perhaps the most common hedges in typical market contexts. However, insofar as consumers face risks-whether it is uncertainty about being admitted into a top college, being hired for dream job, or ending up with the ideal partner-they will also have the opportunity to hedge and, thus, the opportunity to err. Our results suggest two broad ways in which people may make mistakes in such situations. First, people may underinvest in backup plans that are likely to be needed. For example, students may put forth too little effort to ensure that they have a backup option if they fail to be admitted into their selective first choice college, or startup founders may insufficiently prepare for the likely outcome that their business fails. Second, consumers may overinvest in hedges that are unlikely to be needed. Doing so could, for example, lead patients to choose medical treatments with damaging side effects in order to address issues that are unlikely to harm them. As one such case, prostatectomies often have severe negative consequences for quality of life, however, yet, many of those who develop prostate cancer will die of natural causes before the cancer becomes an issue <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bill-Axelson et al., 2018)</ref>. Accurate weighing of risk for these types of hedges is critical for maximizing well-being.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Final Thoughts</head><p>In our studies, the participants behaved suboptimally to a degree that we, as authors, have not seen before. The reason why we could infer the quality of decisions is that in our studies, the normatively correct answer was very clear. When hedging a gamble with an 80% chance of winning, it means that 20% of the time the hedger will receive $2 rather than $0, resulting in an average gain of $0.40. When hedging a gamble with a 20% chance of winning, 80% of the time the hedger will receive $2 rather than $0, resulting in an average gain of $1.60. In these instances, the optimal response seems obvious. However, when we consider situations from daily life, insensitivity to probabilities can sometimes strike us as somewhat intuitive, and arguably maybe even correct. Imagine, for example, the following situation: you are planning to get married in a large outdoor ceremony in San Diego. You worry that it may rain, and so, so you look for a backup venue that is indoors. Now, imagine the exact same situation, but instead of San Diego, your wedding is in Seattle. Because it is approximately eight times more likely to rain in Seattle than in San Diego, should you really be willing to spend eight times as much on the backup venue, or should you instead decide what having a backup venue is worth to you if it rains and just spend that amount regardless of the locale's chance of rain? For such a (hopefully) once-in-a-lifetime experience, it feels intuitive and perhaps even defensible to focus on the worst possible outcome and consider how much you are willing to spend to prevent it from happening.</p><p>Similarly, should a person's decision to purchase liability insurance hinge on his or her perceived chances of accidentally maiming someone, or is it defensible for everyone to purchase this insurance for their peace of mind, regardless of their chances of needing it? When bad outcomes are disastrous, it may make sense to forgo considerations of the likelihood of disaster striking in favor of simply paying to prevent it from ruining one's life. If consumers believe that markets have already set well-calibrated prices for hedges, it may be a sensible heuristic to simply consider whether improving the bad outcome is worth the hedge's price. We believe that it is likely that people overapply this line of thinking even in cases in which there is a clear normative answer, to their detriment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 1.</figDesc></figure>

			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="4">This is statistically confirmed by a regression analysis finding that the participants' WTP per dollar of a hedge's expected value was higher as the probability of winning increased (b = 0.18, t(401)=2.51, p = .01).</note>

Like our participants, she answered that she would pay the same amount for all three of the hedges, giving us some indication that a deeper mechanism might be involved.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="7">This is not to say that no participants responded in line with the expected value of hedges -one participant, for example, wrote out calculations of the expected value of each option in the margins of his survey. 8 It also allowed the probabilities of the better and worse outcome to be presented in random order, instead of always having the better outcome's probability presented first. See the Web Appendix for a full discussion and examples of the stimuli used.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="9">Our preregistered analysis was an identical non-mixed effects linear regression, we report the mixed effects model for consistency with the reported results in other studies. Significance and direction of the key interaction term remains unchanged in the preregistered analysis (b = 4.17, t(2543)=10.92, p &lt; .001; without exclusions: b = 4.10, t(3605)=11.29, p &lt; .001).10 This term comes from a mixed effects linear regression regressing willingness-to-pay onto win probability of the trial, improvement size, and their interaction. This analysis differed from our preregistration which limited the analysis to only the hedging condition. We report the pre-registered analysis in the Web Appendix, and the results are effectively identical.</note>
			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" n="11">If we include the condition in the model as well, we find a significant, negative interaction between the size of the improvement and condition (-0.5 = hedge, -0.5 = invest), implying that the participants were more sensitive to outcomes in the hedging condition (b = -0.47, t(2539)=5.55, p &lt; .001). Given that the final outcomes of the worse outcome being improved by the hedge ($2, $4, or $8) were significantly smaller in absolute terms than the final outcomes of the better outcome being improved by the investment ($12, $14, or $18), we believe that this result is likely due to a difference in marginal utility.</note>
