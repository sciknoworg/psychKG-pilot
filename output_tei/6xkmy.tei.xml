			<abstract>
				<p>Every action demands some effort, and its level influences decision-making. Existing data suggest that in some decision contexts effort devalues outcomes, but in other contexts effort enhances outcome valuation. Here, we describe an empirical study and propose a model that incorporates negative, positive and mixed impacts of effort on outcomes in different decision contexts and in different participants. Participants chose between money and an item associated with varying levels of stair climbing effort. Some participants had previous direct experience with a real physical effort and made decisions about a physically present reward. For other participants, the effort and the associated reward was always purely hypothetical. Furthermore, the decisions were framed as prospective or retrospective-before or after effort exertion. The key behavioral finding was that in the &quot;real&quot; condition, greater effort decreased outcome value when considered prospectively, but increased outcome value when considered retrospectively. Interestingly, even within the same decision context, individuals showed diverse relationships between effort and outcome value. These relationships ranged from those where greater effort increased value, decreased value, to non-linear patterns, where small effort initially increased outcome value but higher effort decreased it, or the other way around (initial decrease followed by a decrease). When our model was applied to participants&apos; individual choices, it was able to capture the monotonic and non-monotonic relationships and outperformed previous solutions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Choosing one action over another reflects the respective values of their outcomes.</p><p>Because virtually every action involves some effort, the role of effort in choice is gaining increased attention from researchers in psychology, economics, biology, and decision neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Białaszek et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Inzlicht et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Massar et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Otto et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2013)</ref>. Effort is understood as motivation-driven intensification of activity (cognitive or physical) in service of, or associated with, obtaining an outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Białaszek et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Eisenberger, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Shenhav et al., 2017a)</ref>.</p><p>Previous research has shown that effort can have diverse impacts on outcome value in economic choice, as evidenced by various shapes of the function linking effort and value (e.g., linear, parabolic, hyperbolic) depending on the decision context and individual differences <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Kool &amp; Botvinick, 2018)</ref>. Here we present new empirical data from a behavioral paradigm designed to elicit a variety of individual effort-value relationships in different decision scenarios. Central to the paper is a new model aimed at capturing the diversity of individual effort profiles. Our model proposes that the evaluation of outcomes is a mixture of effort costs (negative effects) and effort benefits (positive effects), with the resulting net effect on choice reflecting situational and individual differences in the relative weight of those specific components. Before introducing the behavioral and modeling components of this research, it is worth considering reasons for why we may observe a diversity of effort-value relationships across different situations and different individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Diverse Effects of Effort on Value</head><p>The classic "law of less work" <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Hull, 1943)</ref> states that, when given a choice between two equivalent options differing only in the amount of effort they require, individuals opt for the less effortful option because the more effortful option is devalued by effort cost.</p><p>Accordingly, if avoidable, greater effort will always reduce the choice of the option. Much evidence highlights that effort can be aversive, or costly <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Botvinick et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cavanagh &amp; Frank, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Dreisbach &amp; Fischer, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Elkins-Brown et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Hartmann et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Holroyd &amp; Yeung, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Inzlicht et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Massar et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Nishiyama, 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Nishiyama, , 2016</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Saunders et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Sayalı &amp; Badre, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Shenhav et al., 2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Shenhav et al., , 2017b</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Winkielman et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>However, in some circumstances, individuals prefer outcomes associated with higher effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alessandri et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Schrift et al., 2016)</ref>. For example, individuals value consumer products that they effortfully assembled themselves over their pre-assembled counterparts -aptly named the IKEA effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Norton et al., 2012)</ref>. One mechanism behind this effect reflects the sense that the exerted effort added value (subjective or objective) to the product. However, even without effort adding any objective value, the effort justification hypothesis, derived from cognitive dissonance theory, states that people value outcomes more when they were obtained as a result of exerting effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Inzlicht et al., 2018)</ref>. Similar arguments have been put forward to explain the sunk cost effect, where people are reluctant to abandon a course of action because of the previous effort that went into it <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arkes &amp; Blumer, 1985)</ref>. Note that in all these cases, value is assigned to outcomes retrospectively (after effort exertion). But there are also case where positive value is assigned to more effortful outcomes prospectively (before effort exertion). For example, in the "martyrdom effect", the prospect of greater discomfort or greater effort increases donations for charity <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Olivola &amp; Shafir, 2018)</ref>.</p><p>The idea that effort can be both costly and valued has been called the "effort paradox", suggesting the need for researchers to better understand the diverse effects of effort on outcome evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Inzlicht et al., 2018)</ref>. Indeed, as we discuss shortly, the diverse negative and positive effects of effort on value have been observed across different experimental paradigms and even within the same paradigm. Next, we consider in more detail how specific situational features change the effort-value relation and then discuss reasons for differences in individual effort profiles.</p><p>As already indicated, one situational feature that influences the effort-value relation is temporal orientation -prospective vs retrospective, that is whether effort is anticipated or it is already spent <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Inzlicht et al., 2018)</ref>. Note that in the prospective situation, future effort can usually be avoided by choice. Accordingly, one should expect a generally negative effect of greater effort level on value of associated outcomes (law-of-less work hypothesis). However, in the retrospective situation, effort is not avoidable, because it is in the past. This invites potential inferences about effort adding to outcome value (e.g., "my exertion made this product better") or about effort justification (e.g., "I worked hard for this product so I must really like it"). After exerting effort, individuals may also be more likely to wonder about environmental correlations between different degrees of effort and value (e.g., "I guess products requiring more effort are typically better"). All these inferences would lead to a generally positive relation of effort level in the retrospective condition (effort-as-value hypothesis).</p><p>Another important feature shaping the relation between effort and value is whether a person has direct, personal experience with the type of effort required in the situation, as well as the outcome (reward) to which the effort is directed. Anecdotally, when people have little experiential knowledge of potential effort, and potential reward, they sometimes eagerly commit to, or unwisely avoid, "effortful" actions. Empirically, there are demonstrations of some similarities between physiological responses to hypothetically considering (merely imagining) versus actually exerting tangible effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Decety et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Pellicano et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>However, it is also known that participants considering hypothetical versus tangible effort focus on different task aspects (e.g., physical costs, mental costs, time costs etc.; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Decety et al., 1989)</ref>. There is also a large body of literature on hypothetical versus real rewards (see, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Camerer &amp; Mobbs, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dixon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Johnson &amp; Bickel, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Kang et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kühberger et al., 2002)</ref>. Though the patterns reported in these works are complex (presumably reflecting multiple inferences and reactions), they suggest that the effort-value relation may vary depending on whether individuals have an actual experience (personal knowledge) of effort and associated rewards.</p><p>Crucially, a comprehensive model of effort-based choice should reflect the fact that the effort-value relation may not only depend on temporal orientation (prospective vs retrospective) or the tangibility (real vs hypothetical) of effort and outcome, but also on an individual's preference and aptitude for engaging in various levels of effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Gheza et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Inzlicht et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Westbrook &amp; Braver, 2013)</ref>. This can be illustrated by considering examples of some effort scenarios. For example, for one individual, greater effort might reduce the value of an item and make them chose a no-effort alternative. In contrast, for a different individual, greater effort may actually increase the value of the item. As such, the same situation can create opposite effort effects in different individuals. Even within the same individual, the impact on value may be a non-linear function of effort intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Białaszek et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Klein-Flügge et al., 2015)</ref>. For example, for some individuals, low levels of effort may initially add to outcome value but if the effort exceeds some threshold, it could become aversive and then subtract from outcome value.</p><p>Such a scenario would result in a non-monotonic value function, which is at first increasing and then shifts downward. The opposite is also possible. For example, for some individuals, low effort may be initially aversive (e.g., for a pro-climber, an easy route may subtract value from the outcome of reaching the peak) but high effort may add value (e.g., for a pro-climber, a difficult route adds value). This can be quantitatively captured by a function that is first decreasing, and changes to an increasing one. Of course, the two initially described simpler scenarios are also possible. That is, a prediction in line with the law of less work (monotonically decreasing function) and a prediction in line with the effort-as-value hypothesis (monotonically increasing function). Therefore, we propose that a more flexible functional model might better explain effort-based choice by differentiating among various effort preference profiles.</p><p>Before we introduce the details of the model, note that in a broader sense, our model reflects a classic insight that value functions can be non-monotonic. There are many familiar examples in economics where marginal utility varies in sign (positive vs. negative) depending on the consumption level. That is, the utility (e.g., pleasure resulting from consumption) of one additional unit of a good (e.g., slice of cake) can be positive, zero, or negative, depending on the current level (e.g., one more slice yields positive utility when hungry but negative utility when satiated).</p><p>Note also that, in some cases, a non-monotonic utility function may result from the integration of separate monotonic cost and benefit functions. For example, an extra hour of work may have positive but diminishing marginal utility, while opportunity costs (such as time spent away from family) may be a roughly linear function of time spent working. The net result of these monotonic cost and benefit functions may be a non-monotonic utility function with an optimal allocation of time to work at an intermediate level. This example motivates our formal model of effort-based choice, as described next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DPOWER Model of Effort-Based Choice</head><p>Based on previous empirical findings and the considerations presented above, here we propose a novel model of effort-based choice. Our model reflects previous research showing that the value function for effortful outcomes might not necessarily solely decay or rise, but can also be non-monotonic, that is include direction shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Białaszek et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Klein-Flügge et al., 2015)</ref>. We built our model to account for situations where preference towards more or less effortful outcomes may shift as a function of situational and individual differences. A key feature of our model is that it incorporates dual (positive and negative) evaluation of effortful outcomes. That is, in our model the integrated value of an effortful outcome results from evaluations by two subsystems, with each evaluation following a weighted power function.</p><p>These subsystems allow for simultaneous evaluation of negative and positive aspects of effort.</p><p>In assuming the two subsystems, we are following a rich theoretical and empirical tradition in psychology. There are many well-known examples of dual models in the general domain of reasoning and social cognition, though the exact notion of a "system", "process", or "source" often varies <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Evans, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Kahneman, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Smith &amp; DeCoster, 2000)</ref>. In closely related research on temporal (delay) discounting, previous work proposed two systems, one corresponding to faster and one to slow mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(McClure et al, 2007)</ref>. We also follow general research on evaluative space that shows the need to assume separate positive and negative affect systems when explaining the organism's choice to engage in approach or avoidance behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cacioppo &amp; Berntson, 1999)</ref>. This assumption is often made in decisionneuroscience, given evidence that appetitive and aversive values are initially represented in distinct brain regions and then integrated into a final value representation <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Talmi et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>We will return to this issue later, but for now note that the dual can be used to understand the variation in effort effects on value within the same participant, and also the variability in effort effects across different participants in the same situation, and finally across different participants in different situations. As we show later, assuming a dual evaluation model is also empirically better able to account for the distribution of all empirical profiles (i.e., all profiles cannot be explained with a reduced model).</p><p>Our dual-system power model (DPOWER; Eq 1) is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) = * [1 + 1 1 − (1 − ) 2 2 ]<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where sv(x) signifies the subjective value assigned to an effortful outcome of nominal value x (e.g., monetary value of the action outcome). Parameters 1 and 2 control the steepness of each system's contribution to the value function, while and 2 determine the curvature, i.e., how that contribution changes with increasing effort levels. This means that the constituents 1 1 and 2 2 stand for two subsystems that evaluate the effect (positive or negative, respectively) of effort E on the subjective value of outcome x. Meanwhile, ω determines the weight assigned to each subsystem, with its range lying between 0 and 1 (0 &lt; &lt; 1). If reflect that effort effects scale non-linearly across intensity levels-similar to many nonlinearities observed broadly in human judgment and decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Killeen, 2009</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Klein-Flügge et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig 1 we</ref>    shapes that illustrate the different preference profiles accounted for under the DPOWER model. Examples were constructed with parameters ( 1 , 1 , 2 , 2 , ): Decreasing (2, 2, 2, 2, 0.2), Increasing (2, 2, 2, 2, 0.8), Decreasing-Increasing (3, 10, 3, 3, 0.5), and Increasing-Decreasing (4, 1.5, 3, 3, 0.5).</p><p>Let us make the model assumptions more concrete by using an example of different individuals walking to a café to get a cup of coffee. Note that in our example even the same individual may experience both positive and negative effects of effort. For example, an individual exerting effort to obtain their coveted coffee in the morning may not like the brisk walk in itself (negative effect) but appreciate the benefits of the exercise associated with it (positive effect). So, the composite effect is neutral. For another individual, they also may not like the brisk walk itself, but they also do not see any perceived benefits of effort (e.g., no positive value from exercise), so the composite outcome in the same situation is negative.</p><p>These aversive and appetitive components are represented by the two weighted subsystems (positive and negative) in our model so that the composite evaluation is a mixture of these two components. As we demonstrate later, the interaction between positive and negative subsystems can produce all empirically observed patterns: monotonic decreases when costs dominate, monotonic increases when benefits dominate, and non-monotonic relationships when their relative influence shifts across effort levels.</p><p>Note that for the purpose of the current model it is not essential to distinguish whether effort is enjoyed or disliked per se (e.g., some people like and others do not like exertion) or whether effort is enjoyed or disliked because it brings about some associated effects (e.g., health benefits, or costs of being sweaty). Our model is not supposed to distinguish between these subtle differences, but simply help capture differences in effort-based choice, that is different outcome evaluation as a function of effort levels.</p><p>The primary goal of current research was to evaluate the performance of our DPOWER model, as explained next. However, to do so, we needed data that show how different degrees of effort influence value in different individuals in different situations. So, we collected data in choice scenarios that vary on temporal orientation (prospective or retrospective) and tangibility of effort (experienced or hypothetical). In the task, explained in detail in the methods section, we had individuals make repeated choices between options that were either effortless or varied in the amount of effort. These choices involved monetary outcomes and a common item with different effort requirements to obtain it. The payoffs and effort that were being considered in a prospective or retrospective fashion (temporal orientation) and were either purely hypothetical or actually experienced in the experiment (task type). These data allow us to identify and compare individual effort profiles across the prospective and retrospective conditions, as well as within each condition. We expected to see a variety of empirical profiles even within a specific prospective or retrospective condition.</p><p>To determine if DPOWER explains effort-based choice while accounting for different effort-reward trade-off preference profiles better than prior solutions, we compared its Klein-Flügge et al., 2015). We also include dual-system models, including our novel dualsystem power model (DPOWER) and the existing double exponential model <ref type="bibr">(DEXPO;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">McClure et al., 2007)</ref>. As a control, we have also included a baseline intercept model (BASE) which assumes choice to depend on a simple utility difference between the two available options. Model equations and details are available in Supplemental Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Present Study</head><p>Based on prior studies on effort-based choice we predict that effort may add value, subtract it, or have mixed effects. These effects should occur in different decision scenarios, reflecting the presence of multiple individual effort profiles. In order to vary the decisions scenarios, we elicited decisions in retrospective as well as prospective conditions. We also had some participants experience real effort and real rewards, whereas other participants made decisions about effort and rewards that were purely hypothetical. Our predictions were straightforward and consistent with previous literature. In general, greater effort should impact value negatively in the prospective condition and positively in the retrospective condition. Furthermore, effort effects should vary in the "real" vs hypothetical conditions (previous literature does not allow for more precise predictions).</p><p>Most importantly, we predict that effort may not always impact outcome evaluation in a linear fashion, i.e., it may add value at lower or moderate levels and subtract it as it becomes more demanding (or vice versa). Therefore, we expected that individuals in similar choice situations can exhibit a non-monotonic preference for effortful outcomes, further differentiated by whether the effort-outcome relationship is prospective or retrospective and whether the effort is purely hypothetical or real. Although we compare our model to those tested previously, we do not claim it to be the only possible model. Our primary and most important goal here is to demonstrate that the relationship between effort and value may be more complex than previously anticipated. We thus aim to offer a framework able to capture the seemingly contradictory pattern of results from different paradigms, which suggest that effort may sometimes add or subtract value from outcomes. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The experiment used a mixed design with repeated measures (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 2)</ref>: 2 (temporal orientation: prospective or retrospective; between-subjects) x 2 (task type: hypothetical or real; within-subjects) x 5 (effort intensity: <ref type="bibr">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr">75,</ref><ref type="bibr">115,</ref><ref type="bibr">175,</ref><ref type="bibr">270]</ref> stairs; within-subjects). The experimental procedure was programmed in the PsychoPy <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Peirce, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Peirce, , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Peirce et al., 2019)</ref> software library for Python. The design employed a modified version of the psychophysical procedure called Parametric Estimation by Sequential Testing (PEST; <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Klein-Flügge et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Taylor &amp; Creelman, 1967)</ref>. This procedure allows for the collection of data on choices made by participants with parametrically changing properties of each decision, which in this case included the nominal value and effort associated with the choice alternatives.</p><p>Participants made a series of choices between an effortless monetary payoff or an item associated with a given level of effort. The effort was presented as climbing a given number of stairs <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig 2b)</ref>. There were 5 blocks that varied in the amount of effort <ref type="bibr">(45, 75, 115, 175, 270 steps)</ref>, with the order randomized for each participant. The nominal value of the effortful option (custom mug designed for this study) was kept constant (PLN 15) throughout the experiment, while the value of the effortless option was adjusted trial-by-trial using the PEST algorithm. Depending on if the effortful option was accepted or rejected, the value of the effortless option was increased or decreased, respectively, by an amount accordant to the PEST algorithm (initial value of the adjusting option was set to PLN 7.5; 1 USD was equal to approximately PLN 3.84 at the time). By adjusting the value of the effortless option, the procedure aims to elicit the point of subjective indifference between the alternatives, i.e.,</p><p>assigning equal value to both options. As such, it yields a wide array of choices, with distal and proximal alternatives as values converge onto the point of subjective indifference. This procedure was repeated for each of 5 levels of effort. As a manipulation check, participants</p><p>were asked to evaluate their final choice in each effort block, i.e., the choice that resulted in the point of subjective indifference between the effortless option (money) and the effortful option (item), in terms of how much they liked each option and how confident they were in their final choice (for details, see Supplemental Material). These evaluations were performed on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7. Validating our assumption that choices align with preferences, participants liked what they chose more than the unchosen option (so they liked an item more when they chose the item). After completion of the main experiment, participants were administered questionnaires assessing general psychological functioning, measures of personality, and affective dispositions. These data were collected but were not analyzed and are not further discussed in this study.</p><p>Each participant was tested in two sessions with different experimental conditions depending on a pseudo-random group assignment (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 2a)</ref>. Participants were assigned to one of four groups. Those assigned to group one and two performed their choices in the prospective condition, while those assigned to group three and four performed the choices in the retrospective condition. In addition, participants assigned to group one and three were first tested in the hypothetical and then real condition, while those assigned to groups two and four were tested in the hypothetical condition in both sessions. Our design had two sequential hypothetical conditions (group two and four) to prevent participants in the second session from being influenced by their choices in the real condition of the first session. There was a 14 to 21 day interval between sessions.</p><p>In the prospective condition, participants were instructed that in each choice, they could receive the mug after performing a specific effort or instead receive a sum of money without any effort. The instruction in the retrospective condition differed from the prospective condition in that participants were informed that they had obtained the presented mug after performing a specific effort. Participants were asked to decide whether to keep their mug or</p><p>give it up for a certain amount of money. Specifically, the instructions for the prospective/retrospective conditions were as follows:</p><p>"Choices in the study involve the mug presented below, worth 15 PLN. In addition, in the hypothetical (prospective and retrospective) conditions, the participants were instructed to imagine both the mug and the effort as well as the possible amounts of money, by providing the following instruction:</p><p>"The money, mug, and effort presented in the study are purely hypothetical, i.e., imaginary."</p><p>Before the decision phase of the experiment, in the real (prospective and retrospective) conditions, participants were first asked to perform the full range of possible effort, i.e., 270 steps, using a stair simulator. Because this effort was performed before the main experimental procedure, separately from the later decisions, at that time of effort performance participants were unaware of its later role in the study. This arrangement ensured that all "real" condition participants had direct, experiential knowledge of what the effort felt like at all levels (all performed 270 steps). Following this, participants in the real condition were shown the actual mug and given instructions corresponding to their assigned temporal orientation condition (prospective or retrospective). In the prospective condition, participants were informed they could obtain the mug by performing the effort corresponding to the current experiment block.</p><p>In the retrospective condition, participants were told they had already obtained the mug by performing the given level of effort in the block. Additionally, each participant in the real condition was informed that after the procedure, they would receive the result of one choice (real money or real mug), which would be selected at random from choices made by them during the experiment. Sample choice and the materials used in the experiment are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig 2c.</ref> This design allowed for a clear differentiation between conditions based on direct personal experience with the effort and outcome (mug), while maintaining similar overall situations for all participants. We address the limitations of the design later.</p><p>We designed our experiment to minimize the potentially confounding effect of real effort performance time on choice. However, to ensure that increasing the number of steps effectively enhances perceived effort demand, we conducted a supplementary experiment (see Supplemental Material). Results showed that effort demand ratings significantly increased with the number of steps performed, even when controlling for temporal demand. This validation confirms that our task manipulation influences perceived effort as intended, independent of performance time. </p></div>

Models were evaluated using Monte Carlo Cross-Validation (MCCV) by repeatedly fitting the models to a subsampled set of the choices and predicting the remaining set, while obtaining the prediction error and proportion of choices correctly predicted <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Wulff &amp; van den Bos, 2017)</ref>. Each model was first fitted to a sampled 70% of the choice data (training set) using maximum likelihood estimation. Model fitting used wide parameter bounds: [1e-7, 1-1e-7] for the system weight parameter and [1e-7, 1e+2] for both the steepness ( 1 , 2 ) and curvature ( 1 , 2 ) parameters. These bounds allow substantial flexibility in capturing different value function shapes while maintaining numerical stability. The loglikelihood function (Eq 2) for each model was defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ℓ( , ) = �[ ( � ) + (1 − ) (1 − � )] =1</formula><p>(2)</p><p>where yi and ŷI is the observed choice i and predicted probability of choosing the effortful option, respectively. The softmax decision rule was used to transform option values to choice probabilities (Eq 3), defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">� = 1 1 + − [ 2 − 1 ]<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where 2 and 1 correspond to the subjective value of the effortful and effortless option, respectively, predicted by a given model; τ is the softmax temperature that determines the steepness of the softmax function, i.e., how sensitive is the choice probability to the differences in the subjective value of both options. To reduce overfitting and account for the randomness in the decision-making process, random noise was introduced during modeling by blending the predicted choice probability with the chance level (at ε = 0.001), thus balancing prediction and randomness while promoting better generalization to unseen data. Best-fitting model parameters � ( ( , ) ) were obtained by fitting each model 10 times with different starting values. The remaining 30% of the choices (test set) were then predicted using � . This procedure was performed with 100 repetitions. Models were evaluated for each individual per condition separately. Different parameter starting values were drawn from a set obtained by fitting each model in each participant a single time. Two evaluation criteria were computed based on the choices in the test set and predicted choice probabilities: logistic loss (log-loss, ( , � ); Eq 4), corresponding to prediction error and matched to the estimator used to fit the models, defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">( , � ) = − � � − log( �) , ∼ � − log(1 − �) , ≁ � =1<label>(4)</label></formula><p>and πcorrect, proportion of choices correctly predicted (complementary of the zero-one loss; Eq 5), defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">= 1 � ( , � ) =1 , ( , � ) = � 1, ∼ � 0, ≁ �<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In addition to cross-validation, we employed the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc; <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akaike, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Hurvich &amp; Tsai, 1989</ref>; see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Burnham &amp; Anderson, 2002)</ref> to explicitly account for model complexity in our comparisons.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Behavioral Effort Preferences</head><p>Before evaluating our model, we present behavioral results. To remind, participants performed a series of choices between an effortless monetary payoff or an item (mug) that involved different amounts of effort. Participants made these choices in prospective or retrospective fashion (temporal orientation factor). Furthermore, some choices scenarios involved purely hypothetical effort and rewards or involved an initial experience of real effort and dealt with real rewards (task type factor). A logit model was fitted to participants' choices (with subject-level random intercepts) to determine how the value of the effortless option and the effort associated with the effortful option influenced choice probabilities in prospective or retrospective conditions and in hypothetical or real conditions (also controlling for the experimental session order). All inference described in this section is based on the logit model described here. Confidence Intervals (CI) are 95%. Upper case P refers to choice probability and lower case p stands for statistical significance.</p><p>Not surprisingly, we found that the probability of selecting the effortful option was significantly predicted by the value of the effortless option (χ 2 = 600.03, p &lt; .001) and, crucially, the effort intensity (χ 2 = 57.38, p &lt; .001; ̂ = -0.13, CI [-0.17, -0.08]).</p><p>In addition, we observed an effect of the temporal orientation (χ 2 = 9.84, p = .002), but not an effect of the task type (χ 2 = 0.35, p = .555), session order (χ 2 = 1.33, p = .248), or an interaction of temporal orientation and task type (χ 2 = 1.12, p = .290). Specifically, marginal probabilities are presented in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig 3a.</ref> Note that in general the participants were overall more likely to choose the effortful option in the retrospective condition (P = .58, CI [0.46, 0.69]) than in prospective condition <ref type="bibr">(P = .36,</ref><ref type="bibr">CI [0.25,</ref><ref type="bibr">0.48]</ref>; c = -0.21, CI [-0.37, -0.05], t = -2.62, p = 0.009). This overall difference could represent the endowment effect (higher value of a mug that is already owned), and is interesting to study in future research, though not essential to our interest in the shape of effort-value function here.</p><p>Note also that overall choice probabilities did not differ between the hypothetical and real conditions in either prospective <ref type="bibr">(P = .35,</ref><ref type="bibr">CI [0.22,</ref><ref type="bibr">0.47]</ref>  Critically, we discovered an interaction of effort intensity and temporal orientation (χ 2 = 69.67, p &lt; .001). We also found an interaction between effort intensity and task type (χ 2 = 16.31, p &lt; .001). To unpack these interaction effects further, we inspected the linear trends of the influence of effort on choices. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Fig 3b and Fig 3c,</ref>  However, our most crucial finding <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">(Fig 3b and Fig 3c)</ref> is that when the task was real, the effect of effort reversed in the prospective vs retrospective condition, i.e., was negative in the As just described, the behavioral data highlight that average trends depend on specific decision settings. Specifically, they demonstrate opposite effects of effort on value as a function of temporal orientation (in the real condition). They also show the role of tangibility of effort and rewards. Importantly, these average trends hide the variability in the preference profiles across different choice contexts, as described next. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling Effort-Based Choice</head><p>To further explore choice dynamics, candidate models were first evaluated using our participants' behavioral data. Model evaluation shows that DPOWER consistently outperforms other candidate models, regardless of whether the choices were made in prospective or retrospective or hypothetical or real conditions. This can be seen in multiple indicators. DPOWER yielded lower prediction error when compared to other models <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig 4a)</ref>.</p><p>DPOWER was followed by POWER and then by DEXPO models in the prospective condition and by HRST and POWER in the retrospective condition, yielding second and third lowest error, respectively. For formal model selection, we performed pairwise comparisons based on bootstrapped differences in mean prediction error across all models (with 1000 resamples; <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Tibshirani &amp; Efron, 1993)</ref> with the false discovery rate multiplicity correction <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995)</ref>. In all conditions, DPOWER performed significantly better compared to other models-indicated by the highest error-based rank, averaged across MCCV (Monte Carlo Cross-Validation) repetitions <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig 4b)</ref>. Finally, we computed relative model frequencies to inspect the distribution of cases where a given model performed best (and second and third best; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Fig 4c)</ref>. Again, DPOWER yielded the highest proportion of cases where it performed best, achieving rank 1 in 33.5% and 35.5% of cases in the prospective and retrospective conditions, respectively. This was followed by the HRST and POWER models, achieving rank 1 in 26.4% and 25.6% and 19.8% and 11.6% of the cases in the prospective and retrospective conditions, respectively. To illustrate model performance more intuitively, the proportion of choices correctly predicted (πcorrect), was computed and averaged over each condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">(Fig 4d)</ref>. Consistent with prior results, DPOWER correctly predicted the highest percentage of choices in both conditions (72.8% and 71.1% in the prospective and retrospective condition, respectively). As for the other models, in the prospective condition DPOWER was followed by POWER Note that examples illustrating non-monotonic effort-value relationships represent cases where for the same individual the effort-value relation flips from being positive to negative (increasing-decreasing) or from being negative to positive (decreasing-increasing). This is interesting because it shows that changing levels of effort can lead to a form of preference reversal (e.g., an individual prefers an effortful option at low-to-high effort, but effortless option at very high effort). It is important to note that different effort profiles occurred within each temporal orientation condition <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig 5c)</ref>. This means that even under the same circumstances (temporal orientation), some participants show a positive relation between effort and value, some show negative, and yet others exhibit non-monotonic preference profiles. Further analysis of profile distributions across temporal orientation and task type conditions <ref type="bibr">(real vs. hypothetical)</ref> shows that each type of profile is present throughout all experimental conditions (see Supplemental Material, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig S5)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model Simulation</head><p>Comparison of the distributions of empirical and simulated choices revealed no significant differences (χ²(1) = 0.85, p = .357). This indicates a high degree of similarity between the choice patterns observed in the empirical data and those generated in the simulation. Model parameters were then recovered from the simulated choice data. Using a permutation test of differences, we compared the empirical and recovered values for each</p><p>parameter. An offset was applied to parameter values before analysis to avoid negative values, followed by a log transformation to stabilize the variance. The results, summarized in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 1</ref>, showed no significant differences for any of the parameters. Note. Δ, observed mean difference between the empirical and recovered values for each parameter, presented values are back-transformed to the original scale; p, p-value from the permutation test.</p><p>The agreement between empirical and recovered parameters is visualized with a Bland-Altman analysis in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">Fig 6a.</ref> The analysis indicated that most differences fell within the 95% limits of agreement, further demonstrating model robustness.</p><p>Finally, to determine if key behavioral effects observed in empirical data can be replicated in an agent-based simulation, we fitted the same logit model to the simulated data.</p><p>Consistent with our empirical findings, the value of the effortless option (χ² = 948.26, p &lt; .001) and effort intensity (χ² = 104.56, p &lt; .001) significantly predicted the probability of selecting the effortful option. Additionally, we replicated the effect of temporal orientation (χ² = 8.95, p = .003), but not the effect of task type (χ² = 0.10, p = .749) or session order (χ² = 0.73, p = .394). Importantly, we also observed the interaction between effort intensity and temporal orientation (χ² = 31.24, p &lt; .001), as well as between effort intensity and task type (χ² = 18.47, p &lt; .001). However, the interaction between temporal orientation and task type (χ² = 1.60, p = .206) was not significant, mirroring the empirical results. These results indicate that our model successfully captures behavioral dynamics observed in the empirical data.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Here we reported new behavioral findings and proposed a novel computational approach that allows for the effort associated with the outcome to have positive, negative or EFFORT AND VALUE non-monotonic effects on choice. We designed our experiment and built our model to address the diversity of relations between effort and outcome values in different situations and in different individuals.</p><p>Our results and previous empirical findings show that the value of an outcome can be decreased but also enhanced by increased effort. The exact relation can depend on the specific temporal orientation of the choice, that is prospective or retrospective evaluation. Presumably, this reflects the fact that in future choices effort is avoidable, so if the effort itself is largely experienced as unpleasant, greater effort level reduces choice of the associated item.</p><p>However, in retrospective evaluation, the effort has already been spent, so the evaluations presumably are more likely to incorporate inferences about effort adding subjective or objective value, being correlated with higher outcome value, or with inferences aimed at effort justification. All these inferences may result in greater effort increasing choice of the associated item. This is supported by our observation indicating that the DPOWER model's positive subsystem had a more pronounced contribution to the overall evaluation in the retrospective condition, compared to the prospective one. Conversely, the impact of the negative subsystem was greater in the prospective rather than the retrospective condition.</p><p>Critically, the effort-value relationship also varies across individuals, presumably reflecting their idiosyncratic hedonic value for mere effort itself and associated benefits (e.g., health benefits of exercise) or costs (e.g., sweating). Accordingly, some individuals devalue effortful outcomes, some prefer effortful options, and others show mixed profiles. One challenging question for future work on effort-based choice will be to distinguish the relative role of changes in the value of "mere" effort and the value of effort-associated benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Shenhav et al., 2017a)</ref>. For example, a non-monotonic profile could reflect changes in mere hedonics of effort (a short run feels good, a long run feels bad) or in its associated cost (a short run breaks no sweat, a long one does).</p><p>The behavioral data presented here also show the role of task type ---whether it was purely hypothetical or involved some personal experience with effort and reward. Note that the overall difference between the hypothetical or real choice conditions was not significant.</p><p>However, task type interacted with temporal orientation. When the temporal orientation was prospective, effort had an overall negative effect that was larger in hypothetical than real tasks. In contrast, when the orientation was retrospective, effort had a negative effect only in the hypothetical condition, but a positive effect when the task effort and rewards were real.</p><p>This reversal of the effort-value relation as a function of temporal orientation in the real condition is important because it suggests that the dissociations between the negative and positive effect of effort on value are more likely when the components of choice (i.e., decision costs and benefits) are tangible and presumably more salient to the decision maker than in the hypothetical condition. Future investigations could explore this issue further.</p><p>It is also important to acknowledge the limitations of our task paradigm. As mentioned, in the "real" condition, participants had a direct experience only with one level of effort (270 steps), exerted in the initial stage of the experiment, before they made any choices.</p><p>While our methodological decision ensured that in the "real" condition participants understood the feeling of effort and had a subjective anchor for its maximal value, it also means that their actual choices were still hypothetical and were not tied to the performed effort. These features could have reduced any differences between our "hypothetical" and "real" conditions. Furthermore, because participants experienced only one "real" level of effort, their decisions could be based primarily on that level and thus less sensitive to effort level variations. Future studies could address this issue by having participants experience all effort levels for real, directly preceding or following the choices. In addition, in our studies only the "real" condition had a tangible reward. This could make choices in the condition with both hypothetical rewards and hypothetical effort less consequential. Future studies could independently manipulate the hypothetical vs real nature of both effort and reward.</p><p>Importantly, despite these limitations, we still found robust effects of experimental conditions on average choice proportions. Furthermore, we found that these condition averages contain a diversity of effort profiles, with each choice scenario including a sizable proportion of each type of effort profile (see supplementary materials for more detailed information on profile distributions in each condition). As such, our data is consistent with recent calls to go beyond inferences from averaged data that may hide the heterogeneity of underlying processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Haaf &amp; Rouder, 2019)</ref>. Reflecting this, our model is designed to capture the situational and individual differences in effort profiles.</p><p>We compared our model against other models previously used to explain individual differences in intertemporal, risky, or effortful choices-but did not allow for a simultaneous positive and negative evaluation of outcome contingencies. In all experimental conditions, regardless of whether decision scenarios were purely hypothetical or real, DPOWER outperformed all other candidate models by yielding the lowest prediction error. The superior explanatory power of DPOWER stems from its ability to accommodate diverse value function shapes, which allows it to capture the complexity of individual effort preferences. By emerging from the integration of two model subsystems, DPOWER allows for a more flexible representation of effort preference dynamics. Furthermore, the model recovery results demonstrate that DPOWER not only reproduces original empirical responses but also accurately regenerates individual parameter estimates, further suggesting the model's robustness and applicability to variation in empirical contexts (prospective, retrospective, hypothetical, and real). Having said this, it is important that future research explores the applicability and generalizability of the model to other empirical data sets and different decision scenarios.</p><p>Our finding showing variability of effort profiles, including discovery of positive relations between effort and choice, aligns with previous work. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Kool et al. (2010)</ref> found that while most participants consistently chose options associated with lower cognitive demand, others showed no such preference. <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Ma et al. (2013)</ref> showed that exerting more effort on a task led to larger FRN (Feedback-Related Negativity) and P300 responses during subsequent reward feedback, indicating increased subjective valuation of rewards following greater effort expenditure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Zerna et al. (2023)</ref> observed a preference for more difficult tasks in a subset of their sample, coupled with individuals with higher need for cognition scores reporting lower subjective task load and less aversion to more effortful tasks, further suggesting heterogeneity in effort preferences. Finally, recent neuroimaging work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bogdanov et al. (2022)</ref> has also shown that cognitive effort exertion can increase the subjective value of subsequent outcomes, as reflected in enhanced neural responses to both gains and losses following high-effort trials. More broadly, recent reviews of research on the role of mental effort in social evaluations point out the diversity of relationships, with processing difficulty sometimes decreasing but sometimes increasing value judgments <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Schwarz et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Yoo et al., 2024)</ref>.</p><p>In our study, we proposed a novel formal model capturing the complex relationship between effort and outcome valuation. The innovation comes from multiple features. Unlike prior models that focused on the devaluation of effortful outcomes, our approach allows for the possibility that effort enhances value. This feature allows our model to capture a range of individual effort profiles: some individuals may reject more effortful outcomes (effort discounting), while others may opt for them (effort as value). Another important feature of our model is its ability to capture changes and even reversals in outcome valuation after specific effort thresholds. These nonmonotonic relationships could reflect situations where, for a given individual, effort finally reaches a level at which it starts enhancing value (e.g., when effort during a walk starts offering exercise benefits), or reaches a level at which it starts decreasing value (e.g., when effort starts to exceed one's physical capacity). Such intraindividual reversals in the effort-value relationships offer an exciting avenue for future work.</p><p>Our model's ability to capture complex relationships between effort and value comes from the assumption that net effort effects reflect a combination of two evaluation systems, which on their own operate using simpler principles. These assumptions are consistent with psychological theories suggesting relative independence of positive and negative evaluations (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cacioppo &amp; Berntson, 1999)</ref> and work in decision neuroscience on the separability of different evaluative systems (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">McClure et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Talmi et al., 2009)</ref>, though we leave the validation of underlying mechanisms for future work. Mechanistic claims about dual models (whether it is about two systems, two processes, or two sources) require additional evidence of separability (e.g., manipulations that selectively impact only one system, process, or source).</p><p>In conclusion, our work fills a theoretical and empirical gap by providing direct evidence that in reasonably similar situations effort can be both costly (the law of less work) and prized (effort as value). Using a between-subject design, our study shows that the situational differences in temporal perspective (prospective or retrospective) change the effort-value relationship. Future research on temporal perspective should use within-subject designs to explore whether these flips in effort-value relation can occur intraindividually, that is, whether the same individual can exhibit different profiles purely as a function of considering the effort in the past or the future. We expect this to be the case, especially given our discovery of individuals with non-monotonic effort profiles. Critically, we showed that differences in effort profiles across situations but also within individuals can be captured by a relatively parsimonious formal model. Overall, our findings provide a more nuanced understanding of how individuals evaluate effortful outcomes across various decision contexts and effort levels.</p></div>

This behavioral result in the real condition (tangible effort and tangible reward) demonstrates that effort has the opposite effect on value depending on whether the decision involves consideration of future effort or consideration of past effort.</figDesc></figure>

Next, we fitted the DPOWER model to individual choices. The analysis using further confirmed DPOWER's superior performance relative to other candidate models, even when penalizing for additional parameters (mean ∆ = 5.56, compared to next best models HRST = 17.24 and POWER = 13.21; see Supplemental Material for details).Fig 5a shows the estimated parameter values derived for both prospective and retrospective conditions. We evaluated these estimates by comparing bootstrapped differences in means between the prospective and retrospective conditions. This analysis revealed an important discovery: the values of the subsystem weight parameter, ω, varied between the conditions (c = -0.114, 95% CI [-0.21, -0.03]; t = -76.726, p &lt; .001). In essence, this suggests that the positive subsystem's influence was more pronounced in the retrospective condition, while the negative subsystem's impact was more substantial in the prospective condition. Estimated parameters were then used to identify four distinct preference profiles. The profiles were established by inspecting the shape of the value functions derived for each participant. This means that for each individual the monotonicity of their value function was assessed point-by-point, and any existing function change points were detected. In accordance with the assumptions of our model, we partitioned our participants into profiles based on the shape of their value function: decreasing, monotonic decrease; increasing, monotonic increase; decreasing-increasing, value function initially downward with an upward shift after reaching a change point; increasing-decreasing, value function initially upward with a downward shift after reaching a change point. It is important to note that these categories represent examples of the variation in effort preferences (successfully captured by our model), rather than discrete, mutually exclusive groups. For examples of observed profiles see Fig 5b.</figDesc></figure>

Presented are mean normalized values of the parameters in each subsystem, as well as the subsystem weight (ω), choice sensitivity (softmax temperature, τ), and the magnitudes of each of the two subsystem terms: 1 1 and 2 2 at = 1. Except for a significant (***, p &lt; .001) difference in ω values between conditions, all remaining parameter differences did not reach significance.

(c) Proportion of each preference profile in the prospective or retrospective condition. Effort intensity values are represented as the proportion of the maximum effort intensity used in the study. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.The profile proportions, as illustrated inFig 5c, were enteredinto a Fisher's exact test, which revealed differences in the incidence of increasing and decreasing profiles between prospective and retrospective conditions (p = .044). The decreasing profile occurred more frequently in the prospective condition, as compared to the retrospective condition (P = .41 vs .25). Conversely, the increasing profile occurred more often in the retrospective condition rather than the prospective one (P = .16 vs P = .08).</figDesc></figure>

In both scenarios, the magnitude of the net value for each subsystem determines the steepness of the subjective value's increase or decrease. Notably, our model also incorporates non-monotonic preferences. Specifically, a mixture of contributions from</figDesc><table><row><cell>illustrate the different shapes of the value function, also referred to as effort preference profiles, as predicted by the DPOWER model. The value assigned to an effortful outcome is subject to change based on the impact each subsystem has on the overall evaluation. This subjective value could either monotonically decrease (decreasing profile), monotonically increase (increasing profile), or take a nonmonotonic, mixed shape (decreasing-increasing or increasing-decreasing profile), as function of the effort needed to obtain a particular outcome. To illustrate, when the first subsystem's contribution, represented as 1 1 , dominates (with ω nearing 1), the function will increase, mirroring the increasing profile displayed in Fig 1. On the other hand, if the second subsystem's contribution, denoted increases then decreases past a certain change point (increasing-decreasing profile) or, inversely, first decreases then increases (decreasing-increasing profile). Therefore, parameter ω governs the proportion between the positive and negative components in the resulting effort evaluation. We provide an interactive visualization tool at przemyslawmarcowski.com/projects/dual-power that demonstrates how different parameter combinations affect the system's value functions (see Supplemental Material for details). The as 2 2 each subsystem, modulated by parameter ω, can produce a value function that initially application includes preset configurations corresponding to the profiles shown in Fig 1 and</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
