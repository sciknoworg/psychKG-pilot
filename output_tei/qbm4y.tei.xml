			<abstract>
				<p>Mirror-sensory synesthetes mirror the pain or touch that they observe in other people on their own bodies. This type of synesthesia has been associated with enhanced empathy. We investigated whether the enhanced empathy of people with mirror-sensory synesthesia influences experience of situations involving touch or pain, and whether it affects their prosocial decision making. Mirror-sensory synesthetes (N=18, all female), verified with a touch-interference paradigm, were compared to a similar number of age-matched control individuals (all female). Participants viewed arousing images depicting pain or touch; we recorded subjective valence and arousal ratings, and physiological responses, hypothesizing more extreme reactions in synesthetes. The subjective impact of positive and negative images was stronger in synesthetes than in control participants; the stronger the reported synesthesia, the more extreme the picture ratings. However, there was no evidence for differential physiological or hormonal responses to arousing pictures. Prosocial decision making was assessed with an economic game assessing altruism, in which participants had to divide money between themselves and a second player. Mirror-sensory synesthetes donated more money than non-synesthetes, showing enhanced prosocial behaviour, and also scored higher on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index as a measure of empathy. Our study demonstrates the subjective impact of mirror-sensory synesthesia and its stimulating influence on prosocial behaviour.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>In mirror-sensory synesthesia, people feel touch or pain on their own bodies when seeing someone else being touched or being in pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. It is one of the most prevalent forms of synesthesia, estimated to affect 1.6% of the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. A proposed mechanism that may underlie mirror-sensory synesthesia is hyperactivity in the somatosensory mirrorsystem, causing observed touch or pain to be consciously perceived in synesthetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>Normally, observed touch is subconsciously represented in this 'tactile mirror system' in somatosensory cortex to facilitate understanding of touch in others <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Observed pain is represented in the 'pain matrix', a system of both (somato)sensory and affective brain regions that reflect the sensory intensity and the affective impact of pain inflicted upon others, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Enhanced responses in the tactile mirror-system in non-synesthetes have been related to enhanced empathy ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, suggesting that the more sensitive the tactile mirror system is, the more empathic individuals are. It is therefore not surprising that mirror-sensory synesthesia is related to enhanced empathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Because of enhanced socio-cognitive abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, atypical self-other representations have also been proposed as the main mechanism of mirror-sensory synesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>, with more inclusive representations of the 'self' facilitating the incorporation of others' experiences into their own body <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>In mirror-sensory synesthesia, stronger empathy is expected because synesthetes experience on their own body any unpleasant sensation they observe on others: being more sensitive to other people's misfortunes, they would be more motivated to relieve others' suffering <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Heightened empathy in mirror-sensory synesthetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> has mainly been reported on the Emotional Reactivity subscale of the Empathy Quotient (EQ) questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Ward et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> also report marginal correlations of mirror-sensory synesthesia scores with the Personal Distress and Empathic Concern subscales of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The subscores are relevant because empathy has both emotional and cognitive components: shared feelings and emotions, and reasoning about others' mental states and perspective taking, respectively. The questionnaire results for mirror-sensory synesthesia point to enhanced emotional aspects of empathy. One study failed to find enhanced empathy in mirror-sensory synesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> (using the EQ). However, mirror-sensory synesthetes in that study were not verified with an objective procedure, but only assessed via self-report.</p><p>As far as we know, empathy in mirror-sensory synesthesia has only been assessed with questionnaires. It has not yet been tested in experimental settings in which empathy may influence one's experience of situations involving touch or pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, or one's prosocial decision making [e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. We hypothesised that mirror-sensory synesthesia may affect these processes. We conducted two experiments for which the rationale is described in the next sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Subjective impact of mirror sensory synesthesia</head><p>Mirror-sensory synesthetes report that mirror-sensory synesthesia can be unpleasant when observing others in a painful situation. Given their 'mirroring' of pain and heightened empathy, it is expected that for mirror-sensory synesthetes the subjective impact of seeing other people being touched or in pain is enhanced, leading to greater emotional arousal when observing others in a painful situation. The extent to which the subjective judgment of unpleasant situations of mirror-sensory synesthetes is affected by their synesthesia has been tested empirically only in vicarious pain responders, as far as we are aware <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. In this study, individuals experiencing vicarious pain viewed video clips containing fear, pain, or positive emotion, and physiological reactivity was measured. Vicarious pain responders had a lower respiration rate than controls for all emotional stimuli, suggesting distress, but this effect was associated with heightened trait anxiety. No group differences were found on the subjective ratings of the video clips (e.g. arousal, emotional state). Here, we test the subjective impact of seeing (un)pleasant touch/pain in mirror-sensory synesthetes (mainly those who experience mirror-touch) and relate this subjective impact to measures of synesthetic strength, measures of empathy, and measures of physiological changes in the body accompanying empathic responses [e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</p><p>Normally, when encountering unpleasant situations, we respond with changes in our behaviour, and autonomic and neuroendocrine parameters also change <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. If mirror-sensory synesthetes indeed experience stronger emotional arousal when observing painful situations, this may in turn lead to stronger autonomic nervous system activity, as is reported for arousing stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and to increased stress responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. Autonomic nervous system responses to negative situations include increases in physiological parameters like heart rate, pupil dilation, and skin conductance <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. The concept of stress refers to the physiological mechanisms necessary to maintain and restore the balance after perturbation. One of the main stress-coping strategies involves the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which culminates in the release of glucocorticoids, principally cortisol <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>: the 'stress hormone'.</p><p>The concentration of cortisol in the blood (plasma or serum) is an indication of the size of the stress response and the measurement of salivary cortisol can be used as a surrogate for free serum/plasma cortisol <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Autonomic physiological responses and the release of cortisol are not necessarily correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</p><p>In this study we investigated whether viewing (un)pleasant situations of touch and/or pain led to enhanced subjective emotional arousal and more extreme valence ratings in mirror-sensory synesthetes compared to controls, and whether this (enhanced) emotional arousal was accompanied by physiological autonomic and stress responses. We asked our participants to subjectively rate pictures with physical context (negative, positive, and neutral) for valence and arousal while measuring their heart rate, pupil dilation, and skin conductance as measures of autonomic activity, and salivary cortisol levels as an index of stress. Eye movements during picture viewing were recorded to assess whether synesthetes showed differential viewing durations and fixation patterns for pictures of different physical context.</p><p>Stimulus conditions with emotional pictures were added in which there was no physical context. These served as stimulus conditions in which it was mainly affective, not physical context that would cause emotional reactions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Empathy, theory of mind, and altruism in mirror-sensory synesthesia</head><p>It has not been addressed in the literature whether enhanced empathy in mirror-sensory synesthetes affects prosocial decision making. Several studies do report on the relation between mirror-sensory synesthesia and social skills. Banissy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and Ward et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> showed that mirror-sensory synesthetes are better at judging subtle facial expressions, but not at recognition of faces, consistent with the idea that enhanced mirror-abilities in the somatosensory system can improve social perception through simulation. In another study by Baron-Cohen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> however, synesthetes did not perform better on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, an assessment of 'theory of mind' abilities and social understanding <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, and they scored lower on the Social Skills component of the Empathy Quotient. In Santiesteban et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, mirror-touch synesthetes also did not perform differentially on a test of theory of mind, the movie for the assessment of social cognition (MASC, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>). It is possible that the lower social abilities reported in the Baron-Cohen et al. study can be explained by a high occurrence of autism (30%) among the included mirror-sensory synesthetes. Summarizing, although mirror-sensory synesthetes have enhanced abilities to recognize facial expressions and theory of mind abilities appear not to be altered, it is not clear whether other aspects of social or prosocial behaviour are changed. We assessed this question with an experiment to test altruistic behaviour.</p><p>Conclusions about human altruism can be drawn from observing human behaviour after natural disasters, in everyday life or through simulations of everyday situations. To stimulate altruistic behaviour in the laboratory, economic games based on game theory are often used <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The basic idea involves one player dividing a sum of money between himself or herself and a second player. In a 'Dictator's game' <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> the second player just has a passive role. The behaviour of people who donate large amounts of money in this game is interpreted as altruistic. To assess altruism in mirror-sensory synesthetes, our participants played such a one-shot Dictator's game <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. Empathy is considered one of the main reasons why people adopt prosocial, altruistic behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, hence we expected heightened altruism in mirrorsensory synesthesia. We hypothesized that individuals with mirror-sensory synesthesia would donate larger amounts of money than non-synesthetes and that prosocial behaviour would be linked to empathy scores on either the Empathy Quotient or the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. Synesthetes additionally performed the Reading the Eyes in the Mind test to assess theory of mind abilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Approach</head><p>In this study we tested the impact of mirror-sensory synesthesia on viewing pictures with arousing context, collecting data on subjective picture ratings, physical responses, and eye movements, as well as assessing altruistic behaviour, empathy, and theory of mind skills in mirror-sensory synesthetes. Mirror-sensory synesthesia was confirmed with an established behavioural vision-touch interference paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Banissy &amp; Ward, 2007)</ref>. We hypothesized that people with mirror-sensory synesthesia would be more affected than non-synesthetes while viewing pictures with arousing physical context, and would have larger physiological responses and develop higher cortisol levels related to stronger emotional arousal. We specifically predicted that individuals with more extreme subjective negative arousal ratings would display more physiological stress activity. Moreover, we predicted that individuals with mirror-sensory synesthesia would score higher on tests assessing empathic-altruistic behaviour than control participants without mirror-sensory synesthesia, because the synesthetes are more sensitive to other people's state.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Synesthetes were recruited through announcements on campus and in the media and underwent structured interviews via email prior to inclusion. We asked about the manifestation of mirror-sensory synesthesia for pain and/or touch, whether they had consistently experienced this all of their lives (consistency and developmental criterion), for examples of synesthetic inducers (verifying specificity to observed touch and/or pain, and excluding emotions as inducers), and about age and general condition. Only synesthetes who experienced the observed pain and touch on their own body at the same location as in the observed situation were invited to our laboratory, excluding individuals who experienced whole-body sensations or sensations at another location (seemingly) unrelated to the observed touch. Control participants were recruited through the university recruitment platform and printed announcements on campus, and screened for neurological and psychiatric conditions prior to inclusion. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>During a 2-hour laboratory visit, participants completed a mirror-touch synesthesia verification experiment, an arousing pictures experiment, and a one-shot Dictator's game.</p><p>First, in the arousing pictures experiment, participants rated pictures for valence and arousal while their heart rate, skin conductance, and pupil dilation were recorded to monitor stress responses. Because this experiment was hypothesised to affect the overall mood and stress response of the participants, before and after the experiment saliva samples for cortisol assessment were collected and a mood questionnaire completed. Laboratory timeslots were at 1:30 PM and at 4 PM, as cortisol levels are generally stable at this time of day with no significant changes due to circadian rhythm effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. Next, a verification task was completed to confirm the presence of mirror-touch synesthesia by means of an established vision-touch interference paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. This verification task and its results are described in the Supplementary Material. Finally, participants completed an exit questionnaire with questions on the experienced synesthesia during the experiments. At the very end of the lab visit the third experiment was conducted: participants played a one-shot Dictator's game to assess altruistic behaviour. Additional empathy and theory of mind questionnaires were completed online from home. We now turn to each experiment in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mirror-sensory synesthesia verification experiment</head><p>In this vision-touch interference paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, participants were asked to report the location of actual touch applied to their cheeks by an electrical tactile device while observing videos of another person or object being touched. For mirror-sensory synesthetes, the additional experience of synesthetic touch leads to more errors in situations where the actual touch and touch as observed in the video do not match. Following the approach of the original study, the presence of this synesthetic interference was verified at the group level. Here we additionally explored the interference at an individual level for each participant. For details on how this experimental synesthesia verification task was run see the Supplementary Methods and for the paradigm see Supplementary <ref type="figure">Figure S1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arousing pictures experiment</head><p>Participants rated pictures for arousal and valence while physiological responses and eyemovements were recorded. At specific timepoints before and after the experiment, cortisol levels and mood state were assessed.</p><p>Stimuli. There were five stimulus categories: pictures with positive, negative, or neutral physical context (N=20 per condition), and emotional pictures with faces of positive or negative context (N=15 per condition). A picture from the negative physical condition would show injuries or painful events involving touch (e.g. an injection), while the positive physical pictures included pleasant sensations of touch (e.g. soft materials, see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> for example stimuli). Neutral physical pictures included everyday tasks involving touch like washing dishes or reading (as in <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Finally, the emotional pictures included close-ups of people with either negative (e.g. sad, angry, nervous) or positive (e.g. smiling, laughing) facial expressions.</p><p>Fifty-four pictures were selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) database for affective stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref> and 36 were created by us. For the stimuli that we created ourselves valence and arousal ratings were not yet available, and so 14 volunteers (aged 21-64, nine females) rated them online (presented in Limesurvey, https://www.limesurvey.org/) using the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) scales (1 to 9) for valence and arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. For the final stimulus selection, we included pictures with the following mean ratings (derived from the IAPS database or our pilot ratings) for valence: after which the SAM scale for valence appeared below the picture and participants entered their response <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Next, the SAM scale for arousal appeared and was completed. If trial duration at that point was still less than 20 seconds, a fixation cross was presented until a trial duration of 20 s was reached; otherwise the next trial started immediately. The long interval between the presentation of two pictures was necessary to allow the skin conductance to return to baseline.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">M neg =2.8±0.52, M pos =6.9±0.52, M neu =5.5±0.56, M emo_neg =3.5±1.2, M emo_pos =6.</formula><p>Before the actual experiment, participants familiarised themselves with the task through 5 practice trials, and were allowed to ask questions. A chin rest was used and participants were instructed to move as little as possible in order to avoid motion artifacts in the physiological measurements.</p><p>Physiological responses: measurements. Heart activity (electrocardiogram, ECG), skin conductance, and pupil dilation were recorded for the duration of the entire experiment.</p><p>Heart activity (mV) and skin conductance (delta microsiemens) were measured with BioPac Student Lab (https://www.biopac.com/education/) software using a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz. For the heart activity three electrodes were used, two on the participant's wrists and one on the right ankle. For the skin conductance two electrodes were placed on the middle finger and index finger of the non-responding hand. Gel was applied at the touching points to facilitate ion conductance. For the pupil dilation assessment and eye-movement recording a SensoriMotorInstruments (http://www.smivision.com/en.html) Red 3 eye tracker was used with a sampling rate of 500 Hz.</p><p>Physiological responses: data analysis. All physiological data were analysed by inhouse routines in Matlab 2013a (MathWorks) and averaged values were obtained for each stimulus condition and participant. Participants with insufficient amounts of artifact-free data were removed from analysis (less than 40 trials remaining).</p><p>Pupil dilation. Relative pupil dilation was determined for the stimulus period (0-6 s picture presentation) by dividing by the prestimulus baseline pupil dilation (-1 until 0 s). Trials on which activity during the initial 200 ms of the trial (0-200 ms) dropped below or exceeded the baseline value by 10% were excluded from analysis. On average, M=73 (SD=13.7) trials remained for each participant. We compared pupil dilation during 2-6 seconds after picture onset, when the pupils had stabilised after the initial response to luminance change.</p><p>Heart rate. Raw ECG traces were epoched into segments of 6 seconds from picture onset until picture offset. Trials on which the heart signal exceeded 0.2 mV on average or sunk below -0.2 mV on average for more than two seconds during picture presentation were excluded from analysis. ECG data for the remaining trials were detrended and the peaks  <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Participants were asked to rate to which extent they experienced 20 different emotions on a 5-point Likert Scale with (1) being "very slightly" and (5) "very much". The time point of the second saliva sample was chosen as such because cortisol has its peak 20-30 minutes after the induction of stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and it takes a few minutes for cortisol to diffuse from the blood into the saliva. The baseline sample collection (and mood state questionnaire completion) at home was done at exactly the same time of day (hour and minute) as the first measurement at the laboratory, and participants sent an email to the experimenters just after collecting the sample at home to verify that they completed the task at the indicated time. The saliva samples were mailed back to us via post. For details on the procedure for collecting the cortisol samples see the Supplementary Methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Dictator's game</head><p>A one-shot Dictator's game was played <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> to assess altruistic behaviour. Participants were given a folder, containing instructions and two envelopes: one envelope contained ten 1euro coins and the other was empty. Participants were told to open the folder and follow the instructions while the experimenter left the room. They were instructed that they were to be Player A in a game. Participants always had the role of Player A in the game but they were informed that the role was assigned by a random draw. As Player A, the participant had the opportunity to either keep the full amount of money in the envelope or to give some of it to Player B. The only information that participants had about Player B was that he or she was also someone participating in a research experiment and that his or her role had also been assigned randomly. The participants were reassured that their response would be completely anonymous as neither the experimenters nor Player B would learn about their identity or about the amount that they had donated.

Before leaving the laboratory (and before playing the Dictator's game), participants completed an exit questionnaire rating the intensity of the synesthetic touch (and/or synesthetic pain) as experienced during the two behavioural experiments on a 5-point Likert scale with (1) being "very slightly" and (5) "very much".</p><p>They additionally completed questions about their menstrual cycle, relevant for the cortisol assessments.</p><p>Online questionnaires assessing empathy and theory of mind. Participants were emailed a link to several online questionnaires to be completed at home, presented with LimeSurvey software (https://www.limesurvey.org/). One questionnaire was about synesthetic experiences, history of neuropsychiatric disorders, medication use, etc; additionally empathic behaviour was assessed with the Empathy Quotient <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> questionnaires. Theory of mind abilities were probed with the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.

A BF between 0.3 and 3 indicates that the data is similarly likely under the H1 and H0, and that the data thus does not adjudicate which is more likely.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We hypothesized that mirror-sensory synesthetes would show enhanced subjective and physical responses to arousing pictures because of their stronger empathic skills. We successfully verified mirror-sensory synesthetes with a vision-touch interference paradigm and found that their subjective ratings of arousing pictures were more extreme than those of controls, for both valence and arousal, especially for pictures with negative physical context.</p><p>The stronger the synesthetic experience during the experiment, the more extreme the synesthetes' subjective ratings were, demonstrating the impact of mirror-sensory synesthesia on the extent to which synesthetes are affected by other people's state. Although subjective ratings were more extreme in synesthetes, no differences in physiological and autonomic stress responses for synesthetes were observed and there was no evidence that higher subjective arousal ratings were related to stronger physiological responses in synesthetes. We revealed and quantified the subjective impact of mirror-sensory synesthesia in an experimental setting.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. We note that all our participants were female; hence, these conclusions concern females.</p><p>Our findings provide insight into the subjective impact of mirror-sensory synesthesia on the everyday life of mirror-sensory synesthetes. Images with mildly aversive content or even positive touch were valued in a more extreme manner by the synesthetes. Synesthetes with stronger experiences of synesthetic touch during the arousing pictures experiment and the verification experiment rated the images more extremely, and the negative picture ratings were more negative for individuals with higher total IRI scores, indicating that empathic abilities affect the subjective ratings. Together, the results imply that the more sensitive synesthetes are to another person's state, the more strongly they are influenced when rating the images, i.e., the more strongly they are affected by everyday situations involving touch.</p><p>Our rating results therefore suggest mirror-sensory synesthesia and empathy are linked and may be part of a similar mechanism increasing sensitivity to the situation of other people.</p><p>This is not only in line with earlier reports of enhanced empathy in mirror-sensory synesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> but also consistent with research that has shown that the more sensitive mirror systems are, the more empathic individuals are <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</p><p>We found no evidence of enhanced physiological responses or stress reactivity accompanying the stronger subjective ratings in mirror-sensory synesthetes. Physiological effects were present in both groups, as pupil dilation was wider for the negative stimulus condition in both synesthetes and controls, but did not differ between groups (the absence of an interaction of group and stimulus condition was confirmed by Bayesian statistics). This pupil dilation effect is in line with previous studies reporting more strongly dilated pupils for arousing content [e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>. Although wider pupils have also been reported for positive arousal <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, we did not see this effect, concurrent with the neutral ratings of arousal for our positive stimuli, similar to those of the neutral stimuli <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Fig. 2</ref>). If anything, valence ratings in the positive physical pictures condition were negatively correlated with pupil dilation. The only other significant effect we report was that the arousing pictures experiment as a whole reduced the overall mood of the participants, but there was no other evidence of autonomic physiological effects and no evidence that the subjective experience of synesthesia impacted any of the physiological responses. Eye-movement data revealed that synesthetes did not view the regions of interest in negative images longer than controls or that they fixated them more often. We do have to note that for these null-effects, Bayesian statistics could not confirm the absence of effects, but were inconclusive. Still, altogether the data suggest that the stronger subjective affect reported for synesthetes is not associated with stronger empathy-related physiological responses.</p><p>It is possible that the absence of strong physiological effects is because our stimuli were not extreme enough to induce strong physiological responses. Although our pupil dilation results suggest otherwise, the heart rate and skin conductance were not perturbed by the effects of our stimuli. We cannot exclude that we would have observed physiological effects -and also differential effects in synesthetes -if our physical stimuli would have been more extreme, e.g., more negative. For instance, in the study by Young et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> movie clips with strong content were used and differences were found in the respiration rate of vicarious pain responders and controls -the stimuli also all contained respiratory events, which may have stimulated this effect. In our study, the physical pictures condition resulted in a group effect for the arousal ratings which was absent for the emotional faces condition, suggesting that physical stimuli affect synesthetes differentially while emotional stimuli do not. The fact remains, however, that we did observe a differential effect on the subjective ratings of synesthetes that was induced even in absence of strong physiological effects. Hence, we suggest that in mirror-sensory synesthesia, cognitive processes play a more important role in mediating the impact of synesthesia than physiological mechanisms.</p><p>Our results strongly suggest that empathy, the sensitivity to other people's situation, drives the subjective impact of mirror-sensory synesthesia, given that both stronger empathy and stronger synesthesia led to stronger effects on the subjective ratings. Moreover, synesthetes score higher than controls on the total IRI score and the Empathic Concern subscore. This Empathic Concern score indexes compassion and sympathy in response to distress of other people. In Ward et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> mirror-touch synesthetes did not score higher on any of the IRI subscores, but the strength of the synesthetic experience did correlate with the Emotional Reactivity subscore of the Empathy Quotient, in line with previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Similar to the IRI-Empathic Concern subscale, the Emotional Reactivity subscore relates to the emotional aspects rather than the cognitive components of empathy (Theory of mind/Reading the Mind in the Eyes test). EQ-Emotional Reactivity and IRI-Empathic Concern scores have been shown to be correlated <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. Our results therefore support previous findings of enhanced empathy in mirror-sensory synesthetes.</p><p>In Baron-Cohen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, a large cohort of mirror-touch synesthetes (N=46) did not score higher than controls on the Empathy Quotient. However, 30% of the included mirrortouch synesthetes in this study had an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) while rates of ASD for the other two included groups (controls and grapheme-color synesthetes) were not reported, warranting caution when interpreting this result. It is known that synesthesia in general is more prevalent among individuals with autism <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>, but rates for mirror-touch synesthesia specifically have not yet been determined. Thus, we do not know whether the percentage of individuals with ASD in the Baron-Cohen et al. study is representative of any possible wider association between ASD and mirror-touch synesthesia. Also, the mirror-touch synesthetes in that study were included on the basis of self-report and did not rate their synesthetic experiences as very strong (1.48 out of 5). In our study, we applied an objective verification test and synesthetes rated their synesthesia as much stronger (3.4 out of 5). These differences offer potential explanations for the discrepancy between results of the different studies.</p><p>As far as we are aware, this is the first demonstration that mirror-sensory synesthetes display stronger altruistic behaviour. The stronger sensitivity to other people's situations may aid altruistic tendencies in synesthetes. One theory about altruism is that it is driven by attempts to relieve one's own discomfort (personal distress) when observing others in pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. An alternative view states that empathic emotions and concern regarding the other person predict altruistic behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. In our experiments neither the empathy questionnaire scores, nor the strength of the observed synesthetic touch/pain during the arousing pictures experiment (personal distress), nor the subjective ratings correlated with the amount of money that was donated in the Dictator's Game. Hence, our results do not allow us to conclude which mechanism drives altruism in mirror-sensory synesthesia. We do note that the synesthetes did not score higher than non-synesthetes on Personal Distress in the IRI</p><p>questionnaire. An alternative interpretation for enhanced prosocial behaviour in mirrorsensory synesthesia relates to the reported differential self-other distinction <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63]</ref>: selfother merging could lead to greater personal discomfort when observing others in pain, in turn accounting for enhanced empathic and altruistic behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>.</p><p>Several synesthetes and controls donated more than the expected amount of money in the Dictator's game (5 euros, half the total amount). This generosity could be interpreted as an actual extreme altruistic act, but it could also be interpreted as a denial to fully play the game (e.g., because of a lack of trust in the anonymity of the set-up). We therefore repeated the analysis excluding the participants who donated more than 5 euros as a verification of the robustness of the result. This analysis still resulted in a significant group difference (t(18)=3.83, p=.001, d=1.71) with synesthetes donating 4.7±0.95 euros on average, and controls 1.8±2.20 euros. This demonstrates that the group effect is robust.</p><p>The mirror-sensory synesthesia of the synesthetes in our study was successfully verified in a visual-tactile interference paradigm. Synesthetes displayed more errors specifically in the incongruent and no-touch conditions, in which 'mirror-touch errors' were to be expected, than our control participants (in a group analysis). Overall, our synesthetes were slower on the task, possible reflecting overall harder task difficulty for the synesthetes.</p><p>One factor could have been that we used videos in the task, diverging from the original set-up by <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Banissy and Ward (2007)</ref>. Video stimuli are also used in the screening tool that was recently developed to verify mirror-touch synesthesia online <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Similar to Baron-Cohen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, we also find interference for synesthetes for touch involving objects (compare the left and right panel of <ref type="figure">Fig. S6A</ref>). For eight synesthetes mirror-touch synesthesia could be verified at the individual level by significantly more errors for the incongruent condition compared to the congruent condition. For verification of the other synesthetes we relied on self-report of synesthetic experiences in the initial screening questionnaire and during the pictures experiment, similar to other studies using self-report as an indication of mirror-sensory synesthesia <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>. We suggest that future studies use a combination of an objective verification paradigm involving touch interference and the analysis of its error rates, and subjective reports by synesthetes to verify the presence of synesthesia.</p></div>

Saliva samples for obtaining cortisol levels were collected at the start of the arousing pictures experiment, 25 minutes after completion of the arousing pictures experiment, and at home several days after the laboratory experiments (baseline measure).

Two synesthetes were excluded as they reported having autistic traits (including them did not change the main findings).

For synesthetes, valence and arousal ratings correlated negatively in all three physical stimulus conditions and in the negative emotions condition, in line with the notion that high valence pictures are generally calming and pictures with low valence are arousing. Valence ratings were negatively correlated with pupil dilation in the positive physical condition, indicating more narrow pupils for pictures with high valence ratings, in line with calming effects. Arousal ratings were negatively correlated with heart rate for the neutral physical condition. Interestingly, pupil dilation and heart rate correlated positively in the positive physical stimulus condition in synesthetes, illustrating their covarying nature. For controls, only correlations between valence and arousal ratings reached significance: in the negative physical condition these were negatively correlated, as for the synesthetes, but in the positive physical condition there was a positive correlation. Cortisol results were obtained for 18 synesthetes and 16 controls; one control dropped out of the experiment and another control did not provide sufficient data. Baseline saliva cortisol levels (at home) did not differ between synesthetes and controls (F(1,29)=1.26, p=.27, η p 2 =.042, BF=.32, Fig. 5). A repeated measures ANOVA was run with the within-subject factor Timepoint (before and after the arousing pictures =0.11) while the Bayesian analysis supported the presence of an effect (BF=25.5): cortisol values were lower after the experiment (see Fig. 5). No interaction between Timepoint and Group was observed (F(1,29)=.010, p=.75, η p 2 =.003) and no Group effect (F(1,29)=.398, p=.53, η p 2 =.014). The results from the equivalent Bayesian ANOVA for the Timepoint x Group interaction and for Group were inconclusive (BF=.37 and BF=.36). It is unexpected that the cortisol values after the experiment were lower than before the experiment, because we hypothesized that the arousing pictures would increase cortisol levels. Furthermore, we found no increased cortisol levels for synesthetes as compared to non-synesthetes. Across participants, there was no significant correlation of the obtained cortisol values before or after the experiment with subjective ratings of arousal (all p&gt;0.18).</figDesc><table><row><cell>Mood state. In a repeated measures ANOVA with the within-subject factors Mood (positive mood score, negative mood score) and Timepoint (before and after the arousing pictures experiment, baseline measurement) and the between-subject factor Group (synesthetes, controls), main effects of Mood and Timepoint were found (F(1,29)=161, p&lt;.001, η p 2 =0.85; F(2,58)=4.88, p=.011, η p 2 =0.14, respectively) as well as an interaction of Mood x Timepoint (F(2,58)=4.67, p=.013, η p 2 =0.14). Positive mood scores were reduced after the arousing pictures experiment and negative mood scores enhanced. Baseline measurements did not differ significantly between groups (t(30)=.072, p=.94, g=0.026, BF=.19) nor from the other time points (all p&gt;.05). There were no main or interaction effects of Group (Group effect F(1,29)=1.06, p=.31, η p 2 =.035, Timepoint x Group F(2,58)=2.26, p=.12, η p 2 =0.07) while the Bayesian equivalent ANOVA was inconclusive, but close to supporting the absence of effects Group and Timepoint x Group (BF=.32 and BF=.32, Cortisol measurements. &lt; insert figure 5 here &gt; respectively</cell></row></table><note>experiment) and the between-subject factor Group (synesthetes, controls), and menstrual phase (1-5, for definition see methods) as a covariate of no interest.

As far as we know, this is the first report of heightened prosocial behaviour in mirror-sensory synesthesia. Stronger prosocial behaviour in this group fits with the finding that synesthetes are more affected by touch or pain as observed on another person and with reports of enhanced empathy. If you are better able, literally, to feel what other people feel, this may stimulate altruistic behaviour towards other individuals. Relatedly, we found that mirror-sensory synesthetes scored higher than controls on the Empathic Concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) and on the total IRI score, supporting previous reports of enhanced (emotional) empathy in mirror-sensory synesthetes</figDesc><table /><note></note></figure>
