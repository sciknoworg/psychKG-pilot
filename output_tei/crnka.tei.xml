			<abstract>
				<p>Episodic simulation-the act of projecting oneself into the future-affects people&apos;s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Across six studies, we tested the possibility that simulation affects decisions by making people more likely to choose options they simulate. Study 1 first established a correlation between how much people naturally simulated an option for an upcoming personal decision over one week and the likelihood that they would choose that option. Studies 2a and 2b demonstrated that simulation caused a small but significant increase in the likelihood a person would choose the simulated option for their personal decision relative to a non-simulated option. Finally, Studies 3, 4a, and 4b, revealed that simulation shapes decisions in controlled laboratory experiments where options were matched on initial preference. This work suggests that episodic simulation may contribute to a feedback loop, reinforcing preferences by making people more likely to choose options they simulate.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Audience Summary</head><p>People mentally project themselves into the imagined future, pre-living events that might or might not actually happen. Such future thinking comprises a good portion of people's everyday, or naturally-occurring, thoughts. Can mentally simulating imagined futures change the actual future, or do these simulations merely pass time until the actual future arrives? These studies were designed to test whether people who simulate an option are more likely to choose that option. First, we surveyed adults about their upcoming personal decisions. When we followed up one week later, participants were more likely to choose the option(s) they naturally simulated more. What if people were directed to imagine choosing a particular option, rather than letting simulation play out naturally? Would choice still favor the simulated option(s)? In our next studies, people imagined experiencing one option before choosing between two options. Simulation led people to choose the imagined option more than the unimagined one. This was the case for multiple decision types: adults' hypothetical personal decisions, college students' actual snack decisions, and adults' actual online video decisions. If simulation has the power to change the choices people make in the real world, policy makers and practitioners could direct people to simulate-and ultimately choose-"better" futures. Psychotherapists already use imagery-based methods with clients to help them access past memories and process current emotions; our studies suggest that imagining a possible future could be an effective technique for psychotherapists to help clients make decisions. One caveat is that imagining negative options could still lead people to choose those options. Practitioners and policy makers should be aware of how their own future simulations could polarize their decisions toward one option. It is still unclear whether simulating multiple options or imagining other people's futures affects decision-making, which is especially relevant for policymaking contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 4</head><p>People face countless decisions each day, from the mundane to the meaningful: what to eat, where to vacation, whom to marry. These decisions can be complex, involving multiple options, each with multiple relevant features. Personal decisions do not always have a correct answer, their options cannot be compared side-by-side, and their resolutions have lasting implications for one's future. Thus, people spend significant time and energy playing out future options using a process called episodic simulation. We propose that these everyday, naturally-occurring, future-oriented simulations are not merely epiphenomenal; instead, they can drive decisions.</p></div>

Approximately 18% of future thoughts are about decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(D'Argembeau et al., 2011)</ref>. These naturally occurring simulations could be a byproduct of the decision-making experience with no causal effect on behavior. Yet, they could also play an active role in shaping one's decisions. Can thinking about the future actually influence the future?</p><p>The process of episodic simulation involves constructing detailed mental scenes and imagining experiencing specific possible events <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Schacter et al., , 2008</ref>. People essentially pre-live an event they have not yet experienced by activating episodic details, recombined into novel future events <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Schacter, Benoit, &amp; Szpunar, 2017)</ref>. Simulating future events is therefore SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 5 remarkably similar to remembering past events; both require episodic activation and recombination <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Addis, Wong, &amp; Schacter, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Spreng, Mar, &amp; Kim, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Yeshurun, Nguyen, &amp; Hasson, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Mental imagery plays a central role in episodic simulation. Future thinking heavily implicates the brain's visuo-oculomotor system, yielding a predominantly visual mental representation that people experience as vividness <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Conti &amp; Irish, 2021)</ref>. Spatial imagery helps to construct a rich, detailed, threedimensional setting for the simulated event, while object imagery contributes to the emotional intensity of the simulation <ref type="bibr">(Aydin, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Byrne, Becker, &amp; Burgess, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Wiebels et al., 2020)</ref>. Repeated simulation of a future event allows for quicker reconstruction and results in increasingly detailed and elaborate representations <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Wiebels et al., 2020)</ref>. Notably, temporal orientation-the sense of when an event occurs-is not inherently part of the content of episodic simulations <ref type="bibr">(Mahr, Greene, &amp; Schacter, 2022</ref>), suggesting that these representations focus more on the vividness of imagined experiences than on their temporal context. Episodic simulation can shape judgments, intentions, and behaviors. Simulating a future event increases the perceived plausibility of the simulated event <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(De Brigard et al., 2013;</ref>). For instance, imagining being in a car accident is associated with stronger expectations that a car accident will occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Gregory, Burroughs, &amp; Ainslie, 1985)</ref>. Imagining helping increases prosocial intentions and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Gaesser &amp; Fowler, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Gaesser et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Gaesser et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Gaesser &amp; Schacter, 2014)</ref>. Similarly, consumers who simulate using a product not only feel more favorably toward it but also are more likely to purchase the product, even weeks later <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gregory, Cialdini, &amp; Carpenter, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Petrova &amp; Cialdini, 2008)</ref>. Simulating spending money reduces temporal discounting, helping people opt for larger, long-term rewards over smaller, more immediate ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ballance et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Benoit et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Bulley et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Bulley &amp; Schacter, 2020)</ref>. These findings suggest that future thoughts are likely not toothless, internal chatter; they might impact how people make decisions in their day-to-day lives.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Role of Simulation in Decision-Making</head><p>If humans were purely rational, there would be little need to imagine the future to make decisions; one could simply analyze the options on all relevant features, weigh the importance of each feature, then choose the optimal option. For example, how might one pick a new apartment?</p><p>Apartments have many attributes, including size, cost, and commute time. People instructed to approach apartment selection analytically sought information one attribute at a time, compared across all apartments, and accumulated roughly equal amounts of information about each apartment <ref type="bibr">(McGill &amp; Anand, 1989</ref>). Yet, for many personal decisions, too many options exist to consider each fully, and multiple options can be "optimal" in qualitatively different ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Johnson et al., 2022)</ref>.</p><p>When left to their own devices, people make decisions that appear less-than-rational; they are risk-averse, weighing negative outcomes over positive ones, and myopic, weighing near outcomes over far ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1984)</ref>. When making decisions, people spontaneously use mental images-such as those generated during episodic simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Śmieja, Zaleskiewicz, Sobkow, &amp; Traczyk, 2023)</ref>. Such mental images serve as a proxy for information that people are unable to acquire directly <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Blaisdell, 2019)</ref>. By using simulation to gain information, however, people might inadvertently bias their choices.</p><p>When using mental imagery to make decisions, people are more likely to seek out information about a few select options before choosing one <ref type="bibr">(McGill and Anand, 1989)</ref>. When picking an apartment, imagery led people to think holistically, collecting all attributes for one apartment before moving on to the next. Gathering information in this way makes it easier to conjure an image of an apartment. This approach, however, led people to ignore some apartment options entirely. Why not create images for all apartments and then choose the best? The imagery approach may prioritize efficiency; once the mental image meets threshold, there is no need to look at another. For real-life decisions with non-finite sets of options and different information about each, efficiency is especially necessary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 7</head><p>Naturalistic decision-making often elicits episodic simulation. According to the recognitionprimed decision model, people use simulation when they need to make efficient decisions and have prior experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Klein, 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Klein, , 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klein, , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Klein &amp; Crandall, 2018)</ref>. Experts under constraints to decide quickly begin by activating actions they used in similar situations. If there is uncertainty about the first option, the decision-maker simulates possible outcomes, and if necessary, generates a second option.</p><p>Other work likewise suggests that decision-makers initially consider the best, most likely, or most accessible options from previous experience, then deliberate among them <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Phillips et al., 2019)</ref>. These theories both suggest that simulation directs people to think about options they are already likely to choose, increasing the efficiency of the decision-making process.</p><p>Query theory likewise posits that decision-makers start with the most viable option, but retrieving reasons from memory changes the choices people make <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Johnson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Weber &amp; Johnson, 2011)</ref>. The mere act of considering the first option leads people to stick with the status quo and inhibits accessibility of alternatives. A candidate mechanism for this inhibition of alternatives is retrieval-induced forgetting <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Murayama et al., 2014)</ref>. In list-learning tasks, retrieving an item from memory (e.g., "apple") increases its accessibility while decreasing the accessibility of categorically related items (e.g., "orange") relative to unrelated ones (e.g., "hammer"). In the decision-making context, the reasons for and against different options are related, so the act of recalling reasons in favor of one option makes it more difficult to think of reasons in favor of another option.</p><p>We propose that simulation, like retrieval, might actively shape decision-making: imagining an option should make it more likely to be chosen. Simulating an option might make it easier to continue simulating that option over harder-to-imagine alternatives. Indeed, retrieval-induced forgetting impacts personal memories, such that people find it harder to recall details of an experience if it is related to a recently recalled memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hauer &amp; Wessel, 2006)</ref>. Episodic simulation relies on similar neurocognitive SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 8 processes as episodic memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Schacter et al., 2008)</ref>; thus, selective simulation of one option might make simulating other options more difficult.</p><p>Simulation makes the imagined future feel more plausible  and shapes choices in controlled scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Petrova &amp; Cialdini, 2008)</ref>. Whereas prior research used scripted simulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Gregory et al., 1982)</ref>, our approach centers naturalistic, self-guided simulations applied to day-to-day decisions, demonstrating this effect in a more ecologically valid way.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current Studies</head><p>Does naturalistic simulation change choice or is it just a byproduct of the choice people would otherwise make? Six studies tested whether thinking about one option over others changes the decisions people make. In each study, we examined how participant-generated simulation of a decision option influenced its likelihood of being chosen. Studies 1 and 2 measured the impact of simulation on participants' personal decisions. Studies 3 and 4 measured its impact on controlled decisions in the laboratory. We instructed participants to use the mental imagery component of simulation to imagine experiencing one of two options. In all studies, we hypothesized that participants would be more likely to choose the option they simulated over the option they did not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 1: Thinking about Personal Decisions</head><p>Study 1 assessed the relation between simulation and decision-making in people's daily lives.</p><p>Participants reported an upcoming decision and the options they were considering. We collected naturalistic data across two weeks, measuring how much people thought about each option and how likely they would be to choose each option. We hypothesize that everyday simulation shapes decisionmaking, such that the more a person simulates an option, the more likely they will choose it later.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants (N = 170) were recruited to participate in a two-part weeklong study about decisions through the online recruitment platform TurkPrime, now CloudResearch. Based on exploratory findings from Study 2a, we set a target sample size of 155, which offers 80% power to detect a correlation of r = .22 between everyday simulation and likelihood to choose at a significance level of .05.</p><p>Participants (n = 5) were excluded based on the preregistered exclusion criterion of providing nonsense text responses to the decision or not completing the follow-up at Time 2 (n = 16), leaving a final sample size of 149 (age 18-72, M = 37.62; 72 female, 75 male, 2 non-binary; 79% White, 7% Asian, 6% Black or African American, 3% Hispanic or Latino, 5% Mixed race or Other).</p><p>Participants in this and all subsequent studies provided informed consent and were compensated in a manner approved by the Institutional Review Board of Princeton University. Preregistrations for this and all other studies can be found on OSF (https://osf.io/2mf74/?view_only=6b717f1e2b5742cda8336a9fd327d89d), with the exception of Study 2a.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Participants completed two questionnaires about an upcoming decision and the options they were considering for the decision: an initial questionnaire (Time 1) and a follow-up one week later (Time 2). At both times, participants rated their likelihood of choosing each option and their everyday thinking and talking about each option. We assessed the extent to which these naturally-occurring simulations related to participants' likelihood of choosing each option.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time 1.</head><p>The Decision. In the initial questionnaire, participants first reported a decision they anticipated making in more than one week's time. They provided a brief title for the decision, which we used to SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 10 remind them of the particular decision at later points in the study. As exploratory measures, participants reported the expected timing of the decision (with eight options ranging from "less than one week from now" to "more than 5 years from now"), the importance of the decision from 0 ("Not at all") to 10 ("Extremely") and the amount they had thought and talked about the decision over the past week from 0 ("Not at all") to 10 ("All the time"). Decision Options. After reporting on the decision overall, participants listed up to five options they were considering for their decision, giving each a brief title that was used to remind them of that option later on. They then completed the following ratings about each option. The options were presented in a random order for all rating scales.</p><p>Likelihood to Choose. Participants rated how likely they would be to choose each option if they were to make the decision that day. For each option, likelihood to choose was rated on a scale of 0 to 100 percent. These ratings were made independently, so the sum of a person's ratings for all their options would not necessarily sum to 100. This value was used to calculate our primary measure of interest: change in likelihood to choose from Time 1 to Time 2. Everyday Simulation. Next, participants reported how much they thought about (i.e., mentally simulated) and talked about (i.e., socially simulated) each option over the past week using two separate rating scales from 0 ("Not at all)" to 10 ("All the time"). The sum of a participant's mental and social simulation ratings was taken as the overall everyday simulation score for that option.</p><p>Option Valence. Participants rated the positive and negative valence of each option. Option valence was rated on separate scales for positive and negative valence from 0 ("Not at all") to 10 ("Extremely"). These were combined into an overall valence score for each option by reverse scoring the negative rating and summing the two (positive rating + (10 -negative rating)). We used this to test whether the effect of simulation depended on initial feelings toward the option-making negative SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 11 options less appealing over time and positive options more appealing)-or simply made all options more likely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time 2.</head><p>The Decision. At the beginning of the follow-up questionnaire, participants were prompted with the decision title they provided during the first part of the study. They re-rated this decision using all the same scales collected at Time 1, including the expected timing of the decision (with an additional option to indicate that they had already made the decision), the importance of the decision, and how much they had thought/talked about the decision over the past week. At Time 1, we specifically asked participants for decisions that were more than one week away, so that at Time 2 they would not yet have made the decision and would still be considering multiple options. Participants who had already made the decision at Time 2 were not included in the main analyses. For exploratory purposes they were asked to select the option they chose from a list of all the options they provided at Time 1 plus an "Other: specify____" option and rate how satisfied they were with the outcome of their decision from 0 ("Not at all") to 10 ("Extremely").</p><p>Decision Options. Participants were prompted with each of the option titles they provided on the initial questionnaire. Participants then completed the same ratings of each option as in Time 1, allowing us to compare ratings across time.</p><p>Likelihood to Choose. For each option, participants rated their likelihood of choosing each option if they were to make the decision that day. Our primary dependent variable was change in likelihood to choose from Time 1 to Time 2, computed as the difference between Time 1 and Time 2 ratings for each option.</p><p>Everyday Simulation. Participants rated how much they thought and talked about the decision over the past week, which was combined into an everyday simulation score by averaging these two items. Change in everyday simulation was computed as the difference between the Time 1 and Time 2 SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 12 simulation scores for each option. This was our primary predictor variable. We see parallel effects when running all analyses on each component of the combined score (see Supplement).</p><p>Option Valence. Participants rated the valence of each option. Positive and negative ratings were combined into an overall valence score by reverse scoring the negative rating and summing the two. Option valence at Time 2 was included as an exploratory outcome measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>These and all subsequent analyses were conducted in R version 4.2.3. For linear mixed-effects models, we used the lme4 package version 1.1-32 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bates, Mächler, Bolker, &amp; Walker, 2015)</ref> and report the best-fitting random effects structure supported by the data, per recommended guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Barr et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Matuschek et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wright, 2017)</ref>. We report all primary and preregistered analyses testing the overall effect of simulation on choice ratings and behavior in the Results section for each study. See Supplement for additional exploratory analyses of how the reported effects differ according to characteristics of the participants (e.g., age), decisions (e.g., importance), and simulations (e.g., vividness). Supplementary results for this and all subsequent studies are available at:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">https://osf.io/2mf74/?view_only=6b717f1e2b5742cda8336a9fd327d89d.</formula><p>The Supplement also contains more information about the content of the personal decisions reported in Studies 1 and 2. People reported making decisions on a wide range of issues, which could be broadly categorized into the following themes: "Travel", "Consumer", "Work", "Financial", "Health", "Relationships", "Food", "Household", "Moving", and "Miscellaneous". The most common words used in participants' decision text for Study 1 were: "new", "job", "buy", "car", and "vacation".</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Everyday Simulation Predicts Changes in Choice Ratings</head><p>Our primary preregistered analysis tested whether people became more likely to choose options they thought and talked about more over the course of one week. We ran a linear mixed effects model testing whether increases in everyday simulation of one option over one week predicted increases in the SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 13 likelihood of choosing that option. Each participant reported on multiple options, so to account for the nested structure in our data we included a random intercept for participant. As expected, we found that  Note. Results from Study 1. Panel (a) shows the change in everyday simulation from Time 1 to Time 2 predicting change in likelihood to choose rating from Time 1 to Time 2 for each of the options provided by the participants. Panel (b) shows the initial likelihood of choosing the option at Time 1 predicting the degree of everyday simulation reported at Time 2. Confidence bands reflect 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>We next tested whether simulation predicts choice likelihood differently for options that people initially like vs. do not like. On the one hand, simulation might uniformly increase the likelihood to choose an option. On the other hand, simulation might only increase the likelihood to choose an option that a person already feels positively toward and decrease one's likelihood of choosing a more negative option. We conducted a second preregistered analysis using a linear mixed-effects model to test whether the interaction between an option's initial valence rating and the change in its everyday simulation score predicted the change in its likelihood-to-choose rating. Again, we included participant as a random intercept to account for the repeated measures in our data. There was a small, but significant interaction effect between initial valence and change in everyday simulation on change in likelihood to choose rating, b = 0.15 [0.00, 0.31], β = .08 [0.00, 0.16], t(508.54) = 1.98, p = .048, offering preliminary support that simulation might have a stronger effect on options people initially feel good about. That said, the direction of the effect remained the same regardless of the initial valence of the option. That is, people became more, not less, likely to choose options they simulated more, even for initially negative options.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Initial Choice Likelihood Predicts Subsequent Everyday Simulation</head><p>We were also interested in which options people naturally simulated over the course of the week, with the idea that choice likelihood and simulation might be mutually reinforcing. We hypothesized that over the course of the week people would engage in more everyday simulation for options that they were initially more likely to choose. Our next preregistered analysis tested this hypothesis using a linear mixed-effects model to assess the cross-time association between the likelihood of choosing an option at Time 1 and the amount of simulation the participant reported for that option at Time 2, with participant as a random intercept. As predicted, participants reported significantly more simulation at Time 2 for options that they were initially more likely to choose at Time </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>These findings offer preliminary support for the hypothesis that simulation shapes decisionmaking. Everyday simulation might be part of a feedback loop whereby people naturally simulate options they are already likely to choose, and additional simulation further increases their likelihood of choosing simulated options. These findings, however, are correlational. Study 2 tests the possibility that simulation's role in decision-making is causal.</p></div>

However, it is also possible that simulation is epiphenomenal: people think about the option they ultimately choose regardless. Studies 2a and 2b tested the causal impact of simulation on decision-making. Participants directly simulated one of two options they were considering for a personal decision. We expected participants would be more likely to choose the simulated option. In Study 2a, we followed up with participants one week later.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>In both Studies 2a and 2b, participants completed a questionnaire in which they were instructed to simulate the experience of having chosen one of two options they were considering about an upcoming decision. Participants rated their likelihood of choosing each options both before and after the simulation. We assessed the extent to which participants became more likely to choose the simulated option compared to the non-simulated option. Unless otherwise noted, each step of the procedure listed below applies to both Studies 2a and 2b, and the steps of the procedure are listed in the order they occurred. In Study 2a, we also followed up one week later with an additional questionnaire to see which option, if any, they ultimately chose in their daily life.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre-simulation.</head><p>The Decision. Participants were instructed to think of a decision they anticipated making within the next week that had at least two options they were considering. First, they provided a brief title for the upcoming decision and reported when they expected to make the decision (in "days from now") as well as how important the decision was for their life, from 0 ("Not at all important") to 10 ("Extremely important").</p><p>Decision Options. After reporting on the decision overall, participants provided brief titles for exactly two options they were considering for their upcoming decision. They then completed the following ratings about each option. The options were presented in a random order for all rating scales.</p><p>Likelihood to Choose. As a baseline measure of our primary variable of interest, participants rated how likely they would be to choose each option if they were to make the decision that day. For each option, likelihood to choose was rated on a scale of 0 to 100 percent. These ratings were made independently and on a separate page for each option. In addition to assessing the likelihood-to-choose ratings separately for each option, we also computed a polarization score for each participant by taking the absolute value of the difference between the likelihood-to-choose ratings for the two options.</p><p>Option Valence. Participants also rated how positively and negatively they felt about each option, on two separate scales from 0 ("Not at all") to 10 ("Extremely").</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation.</head><p>Option Simulation. After generating and rating the two options, participants simulated having already made their decision and choosing one option.

The simulation instructions were as follows:  <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Meyer, Hershfield, Waytz, Mildner, and Tamir (2019)</ref>. Each item was rated on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 ("Not at all") to 10 ("Extremely"), and an overall vividness score was computed as the mean rating (after reverse scoring) on the five items.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Now</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-simulation.</head><p>Likelihood to Choose. After completing their simulation, participants again rated how likely they would be to choose each option if they were to make the decision that day. Again, the two options were presented in a random order and on separate pages. As in Study 1, our primary dependent variable was change in likelihood to choose from pre-to post-simulation, computed as the difference between preand post-simulation ratings for each option. We computed polarization as the absolute difference between the likelihood-to-choose ratings for the two options.</p><p>Option Valence. Lastly, participants re-rated the positive and negative valence of each option using the same two scales as the pre-simulation rating. These were combined into an overall valence score for each option by reverse scoring the negative rating and summing the two (positive rating + (10negative rating)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>One-Week Follow-up (Study 2a only).</head><p>The Decision. On a separate questionnaire administered one week after the initial questionnaire, participants were prompted with their decision title from the initial questionnaire and indicated whether or not they had already made the decision. Participants who had made the decision SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 19 (Deciders) were asked a different set of questions about their decision than those who had not made the decision (Non-deciders).</p><p>Decision Outcomes. For deciders, our outcome variable was which option they chose.</p><p>Participants who had already made the decision were asked which option they chose (from the two option titles they provided on the initial questionnaire plus an "Other: specify____" option). As exploratory measures, deciders also reported when they made the decision by selecting from a list of dates and rated how satisfied they were with the outcome of their decision on a scale from 0 ("Not at all satisfied") to 10 ("Extremely satisfied"). This information allowed us to explore whether simulation was more impactful for decisions made in the first few days following the initial survey compared to decisions made later in the week.</p><p>For non-deciders, our outcome variable was which option they would hypothetically choose in the future. First, non-deciders indicated whether or not they still intended to make the decision. Then, regardless of their intention, participants selected the option they would choose if they were to make the decision that day (from a list of their two option titles and an "Other, specify" option). This information allowed us to differentiate possible effects of simulation on non-deciders' hypothetical choices as compared to deciders' actual choices, and to explore counterfactual choices (i.e., hypothetical choice data for non-deciders who no longer intended to make the decision) from plausible future choices (i.e., hypothetical choice data for non-deciders who still intended to make the decision).</p><p>Decision Importance. Both deciders and non-deciders then rated how important the decision was for their life on a scale from 0 ("Not at all important") to 10 ("Extremely important"). using a single item ranging from 0 ("Not at all") to 10 ("All the time"). The options were presented in a random order for this and all subsequent ratings.</p><p>Option Valence. Lastly, participants rated the positive and negative valence of each option on two separate scales ranging from 0 ("Not at all") to 10 ("Extremely").</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>21</head><p>(see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2b</ref>). Using the same mixed-model analysis as Study 2a, we found a greater change in likelihood-to-choose ratings for the simulated option (Msim = 1.22, SDsim = 18.10, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-1.16, 3.62</ref> 1.01, p = .156, d = .07, but it did significantly decrease the likelihood to choose the non-simulated option, t(222) = -1.91, p = .029, d = .13, again consistent with an inhibition-based account. These results offer evidence that episodic simulation leads to the polarization of decision options, such that the simulated option is more likely to be chosen relative to the non-simulated option. Note. Results from Study 2a (panel a) and 2b (panel b). Both panels show the change in likelihood-tochoose ratings from pre-to post-simulation for the simulated option (blue) compared to the nonsimulated option (gray).

Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.</p><p>As in Study 1, we were also interested in whether the change in likelihood to choose an option from before to after the simulation depended on the initial valence of the option. For both Studies 2a and 2b, we conducted a preregistered analysis using a linear mixed-effects model to test whether the interaction between an option's initial valence rating and whether or not the option was simulated </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Everyday Simulation Predicts Actual and Hypothetical Choice</head><p>In Study 2a, we followed up with participants to assess whether option simulation-both our We tested how simulation impacted both actual decisions in deciders and hypothetical decisions in non-deciders. For these analyses, we included deciders (n = 222) and non-deciders (n = 36) who chose one of the two options they provided on the initial survey and not a new option. First, we tested whether deciders chose the simulated option more often than the non-simulated option. We used a chisquare goodness-of-fit test to determine whether the observed number of participants who chose the simulated option was higher than the expected number due to chance, that is, 50% of the participants in each analysis. Our one-time simulation manipulation did not affect deciders' actual choices, as reported one week later, χ 2 (1, N = 222) = 0.29, p = .59, Cohen's w = .04 [.00, .17]. We similarly tested whether non-deciders, even though they had not actually made the decision, would choose the simulated option more than the non-simulated option when faced with the hypothetical choice between the two options.</p><p>Again, our one-time simulation manipulation did not affect participants' hypothetical choice behavior one week later, χ 2 (1, N = 36) = 0.11, p = .74, Cohen's w = .06 <ref type="bibr">[.01, .39</ref>]. In both cases, the proportion of participants who selected the option they simulated was around 47% (106 out of 222 for deciders; 17 out of 36 for non-deciders).</p><p>We did, however, find that everyday simulation predicted participants' choice behavior. Study 2a was also the basis of Study 1. We used the longitudinal data in Study 2a to explore whether everyday simulation predicted likelihood-to-choose ratings over the course of the week. First, we explored whether increases in everyday simulation from Time 1 to Time 2 predicted corresponding changes in choice ratings one week later. As in Study 1, we ran a linear mixed-effects model predicting changes in likelihood-to-choose ratings from changes in simulation ratings. Each participant reported on two options, so to account for the nested structure in the data, we included a random intercept for participant. As in Study 1, we found that simulation was significantly related to the likelihood of choosing, b = 4.04 [3.18, 4.89], β = .39 [ 0.30, 0.47], t(510.65) = 9.22, p &lt; .001. Naturally simulating an option more over time went hand-in-hand with becoming more likely to choose that option, and vice versa; less simulated options became less likely to be chosen.</p><p>We further tested whether this everyday simulation predicted deciders' actual choice behavior.</p><p>Specifically, we conducted a mixed binomial logistic regression predicting whether or not an option was chosen from its simulation rating, with participant included as a random intercept to account for repeated measures. Indeed, people were more likely to choose options that they naturally simulated SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 24 more over the course of the week, z = 5.86, p &lt; .001, odds ratio = 1.24 [1.15, 1.33]. For every one-unit increase in simulation, people were 24% more likely to choose that option as opposed to the alternative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Study 2 demonstrated that simulation increased self-reported likelihood of choosing the simulated option relative to the non-simulated option. Although this brief manipulation did not alter choices one week later, the degree to which participants naturally simulated an option in their everyday lives did predict choice. Simulation also polarized options, making the simulated option more likely and the non-simulated option less likely to be chosen. Polarization could expedite decision-making by differentiating options and increasing choice certainty.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study 3: Simulating Snack Options in the Lab</head><p>Studies 1 and 2 focused on decisions participants faced in their lives. These naturalistic decisions reflected a variety of initial preferences, and choice behavior could not be reliably confirmed.

Our preregistered stopping rule was to end data collection when the sample size reached 197 or on the last day of the semester (as long as data had been collected from at least 88 participants by that time). In March 2020, data collection was stopped early due to COVID-19 restrictions. Even though we did not meet our target sample size, we proceeded with analyses given that in-person data collection constraints would not allow for further data collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>Snacks. Ten commercially available snacks with unique combinations of flavors, such as "Spicy Cherry Almonds" and "Butterfinger Popcorn," were selected from a set of 25 such snacks, according to ratings from a separate norming sample (see OSF for details of the norming study and a list of the snacks used). Color photographs of the snacks, 150 pixels in width for portrait-orientation images or 150 pixels in height for landscape-orientation images, were used in all survey materials when referring to the snacks. All ten snacks were presented in the pre-screening survey, but for the in-lab survey, only two snacks were presented to each participant, selected according to the participant's individual prescreening responses. Individually sized packages (M = 3.65 ounces, SD = 1.18) of the snacks were used at the end of the study when participants chose which snack, if any, to take.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 26</head><p>Snack Matching. Experimenters used participant's pre-screening preference ratings to select a personalized pair of snacks for them to choose between during the lab session. Each participant was assigned two snacks that they rated equally on the pre-screening but had not eaten before. If there was more than one potential pair of snacks for a given participant, the experimenter selected the pair that was rated closest to the midpoint of the scale on the question measuring how much they would like to eat the snack. If there were more than two snacks with the same pre-screening preference rating, two snacks were selected based on how many packages we had left in the study materials. This was done to balance the number of times a particular snack item was presented across participants in the study, where possible. Participants were emailed an invitation to participate in the lab study after the experimenters had assigned them a pair of snacks.</p><p>Lab Survey. All testing took place individually in a small lab room with a single computer. When the participant arrived, the experimenter first confirmed that the participant had no known food allergies and had not previously eaten either of the two snack options chosen for them. The experimenter then left the room while the participant completed the survey portion of the study in a standard web browser.</p><p>Option Presentation. At the beginning of the survey, participants saw images of their two assigned snacks and were told that they would have the opportunity to take one of the two snacks home with them at the end of the study. Each participant was assigned a unique pair of snacks.

Thus, any difference in post-simulation like-to-eat ratings could be attributed to the simulation manipulation. The observed preference (Msim -Mnon = .41, 95% CI [-.15,</p><p>.98]) for the simulated snack (Msim = 4.41, SDsim = 1.35) compared to the non-simulated snack (Mnon = 4.00, SDnon = 1.33) was not significant, t(33) = 1.49, p = 0.15, d = .25. </p></div>

Because the assignment to condition occurred when participants started the survey in Qualtrics while the participant count was determined by Prolific when participants finished the survey, there was a slight asymmetry in sample size between conditions, with a final sample of 140 participants in the control condition and 145 in the simulation condition. the online YouTube channel Great Big Story, were used as the two decision options in these studies.</p><p>Each video was approximately two and half minutes long (2:34 for Bottle Messages, 2:28 for Info King).</p><p>Screenshots of the two videos including their titles and length were provided at the beginning of the study and were used as cues for participants' simulations and decisions.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The procedures for Study 4a and 4b were almost identical with the exception of their control conditions and some exploratory measures. Unless otherwise noted, each step of the procedure listed below applies to both studies, and the steps of the procedure are listed in the order they occurred.</p><p>Audio Test. For both Study 4a and Study 4b, participants first completed an audio test to ensure that they were able to hear the video later in the study. This audio test was also used to screen out potential bots and ensure participants were paying attention. Participants who did not pass the audio check were ineligible to continue the study.</p><p>Option Presentation. Prior to simulation, participants were presented with screenshots of the two video options side-by-side (counterbalanced which was on which side). They were told that later in the study they would choose one of the videos and watch that video. Unlike in the previous studies, participants did not rate the video options prior to simulation, ensuring that the simulation task and post-simulation choices were not influenced by prior consideration of the options.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 32</head><p>Task Instructions. All participants were then instructed that they would complete an "imagination task" before making their video choice. In both studies, half of the participants were assigned to the simulation condition and the other half were assigned to the control condition. In both conditions, participants typed their response to their respective prompt into a blank text box and were free to move onto the next page whenever they were done typing. The amount of time spent on the task and the content of the text were recorded for all participants.</p><p>Simulation Condition. In both Study 4a and 4b, participants in the simulation condition were randomly presented with one of the two video screenshots and asked to think about and describe what it would be like to watch that video by typing into a text box. To ensure participants were simulating episodically rather than just thinking about the video, they were explicitly instructed to "include as much detail as possible, including what the video looks, sounds, and feels like." The simulation procedure was identical for both Study 4a and 4b, although the two studies had different procedures for their respective control conditions, as described below.</p><p>Control Conditions. In Study 4a, participants assigned to the control condition completed an imagery control. These participants were presented with an optical illusion and asked to describe their experience of seeing the illusion. This task has been used as a control task in previous simulation research because it requires participants to describe an imagery-based experience in words, without the additional components of self-projection and mental time travel involved in the process of episodic simulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Meyer, Hershfield, Waytz, Mildner, &amp; Tamir, 2019)</ref>. To ensure the sensory nature of describing the illusion was as comparable as possible to the simulation condition, we further instructed participants to "include as much detail as possible, including what the image looks, sounds, and feels like."</p><p>In Study 4b, participants assigned to the control condition completed a description control task.</p><p>This task was designed to account for the possible choice-enhancing effect of additional exposure to one of the options. Participants in this condition described one of the screenshots used to represent the video options. Just like in the simulation condition, control participants were shown one of the two screenshots at random; however, instead of imagining the experience of watching the video, they were instructed to look carefully at the screenshot and describe only what was present in the image itself.</p><p>These instructions were designed to prevent unintended simulation, and participants were further asked to "include as much detail as possible, including the objects, colors, and shapes that you see in the image."</p><p>Vividness. Participants used the same vividness items from Study 1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Meyer et al., 2019)</ref> to rate the vividness of their experience on a scale from 1 ("Not at all") to 7 ("Extremely") during the "imagination task" in all conditions.</p><p>Video choice. As our primary outcome of interest, participants then decided which of the two videos to watch by selecting one of the two screenshots to indicate their choice. Again, the two screenshots were presented side-by-side, and the order of the screenshots was counterbalanced across participants. As a secondary decision measure, we also recorded the amount of time it took participants to make their decision.</p><p>Pre-watch Ratings. After making their decision, but prior to watching the video, participants rated how excited they were to watch the chosen video, from 1 ("Not at all") to 7 ("Extremely"), and how certain they were that they chose the better video, from 1 ("Not at all") to 7 ("Extremely").

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation Affects Video Choice</head><p>To replicate the analysis from Study 3, our primary preregistered analysis for Study 4a tested whether simulation made people more likely to actually choose to watch the video they simulated. For participants in the simulation condition, we ran a chi-square goodness-of-fit test on the observed frequencies of people who chose either the simulated or the non-simulated video. We also conducted this analysis for the simulation condition in Study 4b for replication purposes. Replicating our finding from Study 3, participants in the simulation condition were significantly more likely to choose the simulated video than would be expected by chance, in  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 3)</ref>.</p><p>In Study 4b, we also included a control condition in which participants described the screenshot representing one of the video options, rather than fully simulating the experience of watching the video.</p><p>This design allowed for a more rigorous test comparing the percent of participants who chose the video they simulated in the simulation condition to the percent of participants who chose the video whose screenshot they described in the control condition. This analysis was not possible for Study 4a because the visual illusion control condition did not correspond to one of the video options.</p><p>In our primary preregistered analysis for Study 4b, we conducted a two-way chi-square goodness of fit test on the frequencies of people choosing the video they simulated/described vs. the one they did not across the two conditions. Although people who merely described the screenshot chose that video at a numerically lower rate than those who simulated, the difference between these two percentages (62% for the simulated video vs. 55% for the described screenshot) was not significant, χ2 (1, N = 287) = 1.28, p = .26, Cohen's w = .07 <ref type="bibr">[.00, .18]</ref>. Thus, it is unclear whether the effect of simulation goes beyond the effect of merely looking at an option in detail again.</p><p>Lastly, we explored whether participants in the control condition in Study 4b chose the video corresponding to the described screenshot at a higher-than-chance rate. Similar to the analysis reported above for the simulation condition in Studies 4a and 4b, we ran a chi-square goodness of fit test on the frequency of participants who chose the described vs. the non-described video. Participants in the describe screenshot control condition were not significantly more likely to choose the described video than would be expected by chance (82 out of 149, or 55%), χ2 (1, N = 149) = 1.51, p = .22, Cohen's w = .10 [.01, .26] <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">(Figure 3)</ref>. Thus, consistent with the idea that priming and perceptual processing alone are insufficient to sway choice, merely being re-exposed to an option was not enough to significantly influence choice.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Simulation Increases Excitement for but not Enjoyment of the Chosen Video</head><p>We also explored whether simulation affected how people experienced their decisions relative to people who decided without simulating beforehand. It is possible that the act of simulation could lead people to be more excited about their choice and to enjoy the chosen video more, given the extra time spent imagining their future experience. Alternatively, simulation could lead to post-decision regret or less enjoyment of the chosen video, especially if the actual experience did not match their expectations.</p><p>First, we examined whether people who simulated a video were more excited about watching their chosen video compared to people who described a visual illusion (Study 4a) or a video screenshot (Study 4b). We conducted independent-samples t-tests comparing mean excitement ratings between the two conditions (simulation vs. control). In Study 4a, participants in the simulation condition (Msim We then asked whether participants who simulated a video enjoyed their chosen video more after watching it. We tested this using independent-samples t-tests to compare mean video enjoyment ratings between the simulation condition and the control condition for both studies. Despite their increased excitement, participants who simulated their future experience before deciding did not enjoy the video they chose more than participants who did not simulate, in both Study 4a, t(281.26) = 0.19, p = .85, d = .02, and Study 4b, t(276.76) = 0.74, p = .46, d = .09. There were no consistent differences between the simulation and control conditions on any of the other measures of decision or video experience, including certainty in decision (pre-or post-), post-decision regret, or interest in the nonchosen video after watching the chosen video (see Supplement). Together these findings suggest that simulation affects which option is chosen without changing one's perception or experience of the options.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Studies 4a and 4b replicated Study 3: people chose to watch a video they simulated over one they did not. However, we found mixed evidence on whether simulation impacts choice beyond reexposure. Though simulating a video did shift choice levels beyond chance and describing one of the video screenshots did not, we found no significant difference between the simulation and description conditions. There are also limits to how simulation impacts decision evaluations: participants who simulated a video were more excited about their chosen video immediately after deciding but before watching it. These positive expectations did not translate into greater enjoyment of the video after watching, consistent with other errors in affective forecasting of decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Gilbert &amp; Ebert, 2002)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Across six studies, we find consistent support for the hypothesis that simulating a possible future increases the likelihood of choosing that future. Simulation yielded small, but significant, shifts in people's hypothetical choices for real-life personal decisions and affected their actual choices in controlled scenarios. When considering options in everyday life, people naturally simulated ones they were initially most likely to choose, and simulated options became even more likely to be chosen. When deciding between two novel-but otherwise equally desired-snacks or videos, people chose the one they were directed to simulate. Together, these findings demonstrate the power of mere thought to impact decisions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Simulation Feedback Loop</head><p>We found evidence that simulation is part of a feedback loop. The loop starts with people simulating options they already think are likely. In our naturalistic study (Study 1), participants naturally thought about options they were initially more likely to choose. This is consistent with prior findings that the options that come to mind first are the ones that have been effective before <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Klein, 1993</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Klein, , 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Morris et al., 2021)</ref> or reflect the default <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Johnson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Phillips et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Weber &amp; Johnson, 2011)</ref>. Simulation is one tool people might use to deliberate among their most plausible options.</p><p>On the other side of the feedback loop, simulation makes options seem more likely. In Studies 1 and 2, participants thought they would be more likely to choose options they simulated for their personal decision, consistent with prior findings that repeated simulation increases an event's perceived plausibility . Here, changes in likelihood occurred after just one simulation.</p><p>Simulation also decreased people's likelihood of choosing the non-simulated option. If a simulated future is implausible, people may be unlikely to enter this feedback loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Garcia Jimenez, Mazzoni, &amp; D'Argembeau, 2023)</ref>. For decisions with viable alternatives, however, simulation could be the tipping point that leads one option to be considered further and ultimately chosen.</p><p>Memory-based models of decision-making are consistent with this feedback loop. Query theory proposes that thinking about reasons increases their accessibility while inhibiting alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Johnson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Weber &amp; Johnson, 2011)</ref>. The reasons people mention initially when deliberating continue to be mentioned further as people get closer to the decision. Computational modeling likewise shows that memory is optimized to sample similar thoughts. As people sample "thoughts" from memory, evidence accumulates for the more often sampled option at a faster rate. Sampling then stops when there is sufficient evidence to make a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Zhao et al., 2022)</ref>. We expect that simulation functions similarly by making simulated options more likely to be simulated again. Future research could test this SIMULATION CHANGES CHOICE 39 possibility using ecological momentary assessment to capture everyday simulation as it unfolds over the time leading up to a decision.</p><p>Feedback loops are consistent with work on perceptual attention and decision-making. For simple choices with all options visible, people initially direct their eyes toward the best uncertain options <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Callaway, Rangel, &amp; Griffiths, 2021)</ref>. When looking at the stimulus, the brain extracts its features, retrieves the learned values associated with those features, and integrates those values to make a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Krajbich, Armel, &amp; Rangel, 2010)</ref>. The more one looks at the option, the more likely they are to accumulate evidence in its favor and, ultimately, to select it <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Krajbich, Armel, &amp; Rangel, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Isham &amp; Geng, 2013)</ref>. Indeed, experimentally guiding the eyes to linger on one option longer biases choice toward that option <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Armel, Beaumel, &amp; Rangel, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Tavares, Perona, &amp; Rangel, 2017)</ref>. This may help explain why our description condition in Study 4b did not differ significantly from our simulation condition. Analogously, future events become more vivid when simulated repeatedly <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Wiebels et al., 2020)</ref>, providing additional evidence to support a decision. Our work shows that considering an option in the "mind's eye" before deciding does increase its likelihood of being chosen.</p><p>Simulation could serve as a form of mental re-exposure that people naturally invoke to shape their choices. Previous research shows the mental imagery component of simulation is especially common in daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Conti &amp; Irish, 2021)</ref>. Our simulation instructions emphasizing conjuring mental imagery did not yield clear differences between simulation-based imagination and visual description of the option, suggesting that re-exposure via mental imagery could be one mechanism by which simulation impacts choice. It is still unclear from prior work and the current studies what role other components of simulation, such as temporal orientation, play in daily decision-making <ref type="bibr">(Mahr, Greene, &amp; Schacter, 2022)</ref>. Future work could isolate the temporal component of simulation by asking participants to imagine their experience of the option in detail, including a clear beginning, middle, and end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Across six studies, we see consistent evidence that simulation affects decision-making but are limited in drawing strong conclusions in several ways. First, the effect of simulation on choice likelihood ratings for personal decisions was small and did not affect real-life choices beyond one week (Study 2a).</p><p>Previous research and Study 1 suggest that repeated simulation over time is more likely to influence real-life decisions than a one-time simulation manipulation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Wiebels et al., 2020)</ref>. Future research with repeated interventions in applied settings could help address these gaps. Second, we are limited in making strong claims about the independent role of simulation beyond re-exposure to an option in impacting decision-making (Study 4b). Third, by controlling for initial preference in our lab studies, we could not test whether simulation can overcome initial biases toward one option that simulation naturally amplifies. Finally, our personal decision studies were limited in their ability to capture the extent to which everyday simulation was spontaneous vs. deliberate <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Cole &amp; Kvavilashvili, 2021)</ref>. We look forward to future work elucidating the components of simulation that shape choices in everyday contexts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Applying the Power of Simulation</head><p>How can people harness this power of simulation to improve real-world decisions?

Simulation interventions aimed to motivate behavior change by imagining catastrophic future climate impacts could backfire by making them seem more plausible and harder to avoid.
