			<abstract>
				<p>Attention to deviant notes in familiar food odours serves as a protective mechanism that leads to the rejection of contaminated foods. However, when the caloric need is high the cost of not eating may outweigh the risk of contamination. To what extent attentional focus on potentially deviant odour components is influenced by metabolic state is unknown. In this study, participants (N = 36) made judgments on the perceptual dominance of a target odour (food or non-food) in an odour mixture under hungry and sated conditions. Our results demonstrate that 1) participants are more sensitive to contamination in food compared to non-food targets and that 2) contaminants in food targets are detected at even lower concentrations when participants are hungry compared to sated. These findings indicate a generalised heightened sensitivity to deviance in food compared to non-food odours, which arises independently of metabolic state and is preserved even when directed attention is experimentally modulated away from the food target. This increased sensitivity to deviance during hunger may indicate a heightened attentiveness to food odour contamination in situations where food intake is likely. This study highlights the vital role of metabolic state as a modulator of olfactory perception, and its role in regulating food intake.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Every time we eat, we must decide whether the food on the plate is likely to be a safe source of energy that should be swallowed or a potential health threat that would be dangerous to ingest.</p><p>Getting this binary decision right is crucial for maintaining the balance between sufficient calorie intake on the one hand, and avoidance of accidental poisoning on the other. In navigating this task, we draw on a lifetime of experience: it is well established that humans are more likely to accept foods when they resemble a familiar and expected object and reject them when they do not (Agus <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Khorisantono et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fondberg et al., 2018</ref>). Yet, in a world where biological variations (e.g. ripeness) and differences in preparation can cause foods to vary considerably from objects stored in memory, deciding whether an object is identical or different from expectation is non-trivial. In addition, our metabolic needs may influence what an "adaptive decision" entails: when caloric need is low, avoiding contamination may be of utmost importance, while in a high need state, a risk of contamination may be acceptable to avoid the more acute threat of starvation. Odours play a crucial role in supporting these perceptual decisions because they are encountered in concordance with, and sometimes even before, other food cues, such as its visual appearance or taste <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Stevenson, 2010)</ref>. While increasing evidence points to intrinsic modulation of perception as a way to navigate the allostatic needs of our body, it remains poorly understood how the perceptual experience of food odour adapts to navigate these competing environmental pressures under different metabolic need states.</p><p>Typically, food odours are complex chemical mixtures that together create the experience of a distinct familiar odour object, which can be perceptually separated from the background noise of an odorous environment. This figure-ground segregation has been discussed as an essential characteristic of objecthood in the chemical senses <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Stevenson, 2014)</ref>. To be adaptive, perceptual decisions on these mixtures must maintain a certain level of stability against nutritionally irrelevant variation, "perceptual sameness" <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gottfried, 2010)</ref>, while still reliably detecting variation indicative of hazards. For example, categorising a variety of different bananas based on family resemblance to a prototype, or "stereotypical" banana, would be beneficial in a natural environment where most traits and characteristics exist on a spectrum or under a normal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Smith, 2014)</ref>, and comparable benefits may arise from consuming any of these. While the perceived differences in the smell coming from two separate bananas must be understood as natural variation and perceptually understood as part of the banana concept integrated into the concept of banana, the smell of a rotten banana should be categorised as contaminated and inedible.</p><p>Object categorisation in olfaction balances flexible object percepts with perceptual stability for optimised decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Stevenson 2014</ref>). In the brain, both the stable perception of the same, and the differentiation of separate, odours have been demonstrated to be represented in neural patterns of ensemble activity in the posterior piriform cortex, which highlights a mechanistic role of pattern separation and pattern completion <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barnes et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wilson &amp; Sullivan, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wilson, 2009)</ref>. Specifically, higher ensemble overlap is associated with increased perceptual similarity between any two given odours <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gottfried, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wilson &amp; Sullivan, 2011)</ref>. Given its anatomical location at the intersection between early sensory olfactory processing and limbic as well as higher cortical processing, the piriform cortex is hypothesised to enrich odour percepts by integrating input from emotion, memory, and cognition, functioning in a manner similar to a sensory association cortex <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Gottfried, 2010)</ref>.</p><p>This integration is thought to give rise to odour percepts that are flexible and can change based on extrinsic factors. Experimental manipulations of directed attention have shown that activity in the piriform cortex changes with active attention to an odour stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Zelano et al., 2005)</ref> and odour detection in a mixture is improved when individuals are prompted to focus on that specific target odour <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Zelano et al., 2011)</ref>. Functional neuroimaging evidence further shows selective attention towards a target odour activates search templates in the piriform cortex, facilitating navigation of a noisy olfactory environment through enhanced sensitivity to attended stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Freeman, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Zelano et al., 2011)</ref>. Guided attention is an adaptive mechanism that facilitates goal-directed behaviour (Veldhuizen, 2017) and scouting the environment for sources of food is a prime goal of most animals. Studies that directly test whether metabolic states can function as drivers of such attentional adaptation in humans are, however, still lacking.</p><p>What has been shown by a plethora of evidence is that humans process food odours and nonfood odours differentially, indicating the capacity of motivationally relevant odours of ecological salience to capture attention. For example, participants had shorter reaction times in a stimulus detection task for food compared to non-food odours, independent of stimulus pleasantness <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boesveldt et al., 2010)</ref>. Moreover, repeated exposure to food odours leads to decreased reported pleasantness but stable perceived intensity, while the subjective intensity of non-food odours decreases with repeated exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Fontana et al., 2023)</ref>. Likewise, a recent study that presented mixtures of food and non-food odours showed that participants were less likely to perceive the food component as perceptually dominant post-compared to pre-meal and this was especially true when the ingested meal matched the presented food stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Shanahan et al., 2021)</ref>. This bias away from the food odour in the meal-matched condition has also been demonstrated in fMRI data, where classification performance into food or non-food odours within olfactory and limbic areas are more robust pre-than post-meal, possibly reflecting the loss of functional relevance of this distinction. Combined, these findings demonstrate that hunger as an ecologically salient intrinsic factor might provide an adaptive mechanism that impacts perception and helps us satisfy nutritional needs. As such, metabolic needs may affect both the ability to detect food odours in a noisy sensory environment and the threshold for perceived edibility, but studies testing this assumption explicitly are still lacking.</p><p>The present study aimed to fill this gap by modulating guided attention and metabolic status during deviation perception in food and non-food odours. In line with previous research, we expected that perceived odour dominance would increase along with target odour concentrations and that increased difficulty of categorisation around the perceptual midpoint would be reflected by longer response times. Instructions that draw attention to either the food-or the non-food target, respectively, were hypothesised to lead to shifts of psychometric perceptual choice curves away from the attended stimulus. A modulatory influence of metabolic needs on olfactory perceptual deviation processing is perceivable as being either able to increase an attentional capture of the target according to task instructions or overwrite it. Thus, understanding the joint effects of hunger and attention on odour perception would shed light on the fundamental mechanisms of sensory processing and may have practical implications for addressing issues related to eating behaviours, such as overeating or food aversions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Healthy participants between 18 and 35 years signed up for this study. They were asked not to eat or drink anything besides water on the mornings of study participation. Eligibility requirements included self-reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and BMI between 17 and 26 based on self-reported height and weight. Participants were tested for smell dysfunction with the 16-item cued odour identification subtest of the Sniffin' Sticks <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hummel et al., 1997)</ref> with an inclusion cutoff of 11 correct identifications. Taste identification was assessed based on taste sprays for sweet, sour, salty and bitter, where all needed to be labelled correctly <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Vennemann et al., 2008)</ref>. Participants completed the Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) assessment <ref type="bibr">(Stewart et al., 2004)</ref> and were excluded if they showed severe or extreme (scores 55-100) obstruction <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lipan &amp; Most, 2013)</ref>. Participants were excluded if they self-reported to follow a vegan diet, because some foods in this study contained animal products, were not typically eating breakfast or if they were gluten intolerant. We aimed for a final sample of 40 participants, but four subjects had to be excluded post-hoc due to issues with a batch of stimulus material. The final sample consisted of 36 participants (25 women), between 18 and 34 years (M = 27.27, SD = 3.83), BMI between 17.9 and 25.7 (M = 21.65, SD = 2.06), and length of education between 13 and 21 years (M = 17.36, SD = 1.91).</p><p>The effectiveness of the hunger manipulation was assessed with the help of visual analogue scales (VAS; "How hungry are you right now?"), ranging from 0 ("Not at all") to 100</p><p>("Hungriest I have ever been"), where participants needed to score higher on hunger in the hungry than the sated condition (see below). Additional VAS assessed thirst ("How thirsty are you right now?") and perceived alertness ("How alert do you feel?") as potential confounds to the hunger manipulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>The study was advertised on the participant recruitment system Sona and on flyers distributed on the campus of Karolinska Institutet. Two sessions were booked for each participant, both at either 9 or 11 am, with at least one day and a maximum of fourteen days between them.</p><p>For the first testing session, participants arrived at the lab fasted. Depending on the randomisation scheme, participants either received a standardised breakfast or remained fasted.</p><p>The standardised breakfast consisted of five warm pancakes, 150 g of strawberry jam, and 1 dl of lactose-free whipped cream. Participants were prompted to eat to satiety and only finish the meal if they did not feel hungry anymore. The experimenter was neither blind to the subjects' metabolic status nor the presented stimuli.</p><p>All participants then completed the Sniffin' Sticks, taste sprays and questionnaires.</p><p>Those that performed below cut-off on the former (NSniffin' Sticks = 3, NTaste sprays = 4) or did not meet inclusion criteria (N = 2) were excluded from the remainder of the study. Eligible participants completed a short practice run of the odour perception task on the three test set odours to get familiarised with the testing protocol. Before beginning the main task, the experimenter ensured that participants had waited at least fifteen minutes after eating to ensure proper digestion and satiety. Respiration was recorded throughout the task.</p><p>In the second session, participants received the opposing meal condition (standardised breakfast or no breakfast) and completed the practice run again to remind them of the task instructions, after which they completed the main task. Following study completion, participants were debriefed and reimbursed with gift vouchers worth 400 SEK.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Odour stimuli and stimulus presentation</head><p>The odour stimulus material consisted of three pairs of food and non-food odours; one pair for training the task and one pair for the main task on each testing day. We opted for two separate sets of main task odours to avoid any potential bias that might have been caused by repeated exposure over the two sessions. All stimuli were piloted (N=8) to be of comparable intensity and pleasantness. The training set consisted of a watermelon (Vattenmelon, Stockholms Aeter &amp; Essencefabrik, 57.14% volume/volume in propylene glycol) and a lavender odour (Lavendel, Stockholms Aeter &amp; Essencefabrik, 57.14% volume/volume in propylene glycol). The first battery of the main task set consisted of cake (Cake, Stockholms</p><p>Aeter &amp; Essencefabrik, 54.54% volume/volume in propylene glycol) and pine odours (√Ñdelgran, Interlam ab, 13.05% volume/volume in propylene glycol). The second battery consisted of vegetable broth odour (mirepoix, International Flavors and Fragrances, 0.45% weight/volume in 4.17% volume/volume ethanol) and flowery perfume odour (Ambra diffuser, Dr. Vranjes Firenze, 33.33% volume/volume in 32% volume/volume ethanol). The combinations were chosen to create odour percepts unlikely to exist in real life to facilitate discrimination of the individual components.</p><p>During the training run, participants were presented with the two training odours, as well as a 50/50 mixture of the two. For the two parallel batteries of the main experiment, two dilution series were created between the respective food and non-food odour pairs, resulting in five dilution steps of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the food component, respectively.</p><p>Throughout the study, stimuli were presented to participants using a computer-controlled 16channel olfactometer <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Lundstr√∂m et al., 2010)</ref>. In this set-up, air flowed through odourcontaining glass jars (3 L/s) and the resulting odourised headspace was presented to the participant orthonasally via nosepieces positioned in both nostrils. Two channels were used for non-odourised airflow. One of these channels was opened as soon as an odour channel was closed so that participants received non-odourised air in between trials. Switching between channels may be recognised by the participant based on an audible clicking of the channel valve and/or a tactile "puff" sensed from the nosepiece. Thus, the second non-odourised channel produced a constant flow of low air pressure (1 L/s) that masked channel switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boesveldt et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Miller et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Seubert et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>The order of food and non-food target blocks as well as the presentation of the vegetable broth to perfume dilution series in session one vs. two were randomised resulting in eight possible combinations (2 x 2 x 2). On the main task run participants were presented with a new set of odours -that is, had they received vegetable broth and perfume in session one, they would now be exposed to cake and pine, and vice versa. This was done to avoid any potential bias that might have been caused by their previous exposure to specific stimuli.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Odour Perception Task</head><p>A computerised odour perception and decision-making task comprised the main part of this study and was implemented in PsychoPy <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Peirce et al., 2019)</ref>. The task was first explained to the participants verbally and then practised with six practice trials using the training odour set. On each testing day, participants were first exposed to the pure food and non-food odours used in the given session. Thus, they either received pine and cake or vegetable broth and perfume odours for three seconds each to familiarise themselves with the stimuli. During stimulus presentation, pictures of odour-related objects (i.e. a pinecone, a cake, a bowl of vegetable soup or a bottle of perfume) were displayed on the screen. Participants were then asked to rate the odour's intensity ("How intense is this odour?") and pleasantness ("How much do you like this odour?"). Participants recorded their answers on VAS ranging from 1 to 5, with corresponding labels ranging from "very weak" to "very strong" and "strong dislike" to "like very much" for intensity and pleasantness, respectively.</p><p>The subsequent main task consisted of two blocks of a perceptual decision-making task.</p><p>At the beginning of each block, either the food or the non-food odour of the respective battery was presented as the target for upcoming trials, with the order counterbalanced across subjects.</p><p>The phrase "your target in the upcoming trials is" and the associated picture were displayed on the screen for each block.</p><p>On each trial of the task, participants were presented with one of the five odours in the dilution series and were asked to indicate via button press (yes vs. no) whether the target odour dominated the percept. The trial ended as soon as the participants had made their decision and odour exposure stopped upon button press, or after 40 seconds without a response. In that way, participants were able to smell each odour for as long as they wanted. On each trial, response and response time were recorded. Each odour of the dilution series was presented seven times per block, resulting in a total of 70 trials per participant per session (i.e. 35 times with food and 35 times with a non-food as the target). Lastly, participants rated both the pleasantness and intensity of the target odours again. The order of hungry vs. sated state, food and non-food target blocks as well as the presentation of the vegetable broth to perfume dilution series in session one vs. two were randomized resulting in eight possible combinations (2 x 2 x 2).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1. Study flow</head><p>Participants completed two study sessions, one with a standardised breakfast and one without. In the first session participants completed olfactory, taste and other screenings to be included in the remainder of the study. In both sessions a short practice run was used to learn the task instructions. During the main part of the study the two target odours of the given session were first presented for ratings (intensity and pleasantness) after which two blocks of a perceptual decision-making task were completed. In each block, one of the two odours was presented as the target to be identified on each trial. Session two repeated the practice and main task runs with a different set of odours.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical Analysis</head><p>All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.3.3) within the RStudio environment (version 2023.12.1). To verify that the hunger manipulation was successful, reported hunger and alertness ratings were compared between the two sessions (hungry vs. sated) using a paired samples t-test. In the case where assumptions for parametric testing were violated, a Wilcoxon signed rank test was used instead.</p><p>A description of relevant independent and dependent variables for the main experiment can be found in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulus Ratings</head><p>Potential changes in pleasantness and intensity were investigated for all four pure odours (broth, perfume, cake, pine) pre-and post-task. Visual data inspection via density and QQ plots and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests indicated slight deviations for the pine and broth post-task pleasantness ratings. In the absence of extreme outliers and heteroscedasticity, it has been shown that Gaussian models are relatively robust against these violations, even with very small sample sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Knief &amp; Forstmeier, 2021)</ref>. For exploratory analysis of intensity and pleasantness, we therefore conducted two-way within-subjects ANOVAs to assess the effects of timepoint (pre-vs. post-task), odour and their interaction on participants' ratings. Because we were mainly interested in demonstrating no differences between the groups, we complemented this analysis with follow-up equivalence testing using the TOSTER package <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Lakens, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lakens et al., 2018)</ref>. We constructed our equivalence intervals based on the smallest effect size we had 80% power to detect (Cohen's dz = 0.48, N = 36, 1-Œ≤ = 0.80). Finally, we investigated differences in pleasantness and intensity between food and non-food odours pre-task with a two-way within-subjects ANOVA with metabolic status, odour type (food vs non-food) and their interaction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Perceptual Decision-Making Task</head><p>The responses given on each trial of the perception task (target dominant, yes vs no) and the associated response times (RT), were analysed, as pre-registered, through mixed effects models with a subject random intercept in the lme4 package <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref> and t-tests (or nonparametric equivalents). In line with the analysis plan, responses were modelled with a generalised linear model specifying a binomial (logit) link function and estimated using ML and a BOBYQA optimiser. Identifiability issues of the model were solved by rescaling the target odour concentration to a 0-10 range. For consistency, we applied the same transformation in the RT model. Here, visual inspection indicated a positive skew of RT as well as a quadratic relationship with the target odour concentration, thereby violating the normality and linearity assumptions, respectively. Adding both a linear as well as a squared term for concentration and log transforming the outcome variable mitigated these problems. The RT model was estimated using REML and a nloptwrap optimiser. For both response and RT, we determined the bestfitting model through backwards elimination of insignificant interactions and formal model comparison. All models we formally compared can be found in the Appendix <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Meteyard and Davies 2020)</ref>. We also examined the potential impact of order effects by including a covariate that indicated whether a participant had begun with a hungry or sated session. Adding this variable did not improve the fit of either model, and therefore was not included in the final models. Collinearity and assumptions were checked for the models through variance inflation factors of model predictors and residual plots, respectively. The reported coefficient of determination (R 2 ) will comprise both a conditional and a marginal R 2 , as has been suggested for generalised linear mixed-effect models <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Nakagawa &amp; Schielzeth, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Exploratory analyses investigated condition effects on the response psychometric functions by fitting generalised linear models with logit link function (Equation 1) separately for each combination of metabolic status (hungry vs. sated) and target odour identity (food vs. nonfood).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( ) = 1 1+ ‚àí( 0+ 1 ) (Equation 1)</formula><p>Group-level fits were used for illustrative purposes only, while subject-level beta coefficients (Œ≤0, Œ≤1) were then used to compute parameters of interest for further analysis. The point of subjective equality (PSE, Equation 2) defines the location of the psychometric function and is a measure of response bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Knoblauch &amp; Maloney, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McCarley &amp; Yamani, 2021)</ref>. Here, this measure describes at which concentrations the two odour stimuli in a mixture are perceived as dominant on 50% of trials each <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gescheider, 1997)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">= ‚àí 0 1 (Equation 2)</formula><p>The just noticeable difference (JND, Equation 3) determines the smallest difference between two stimuli that one can detect and is related to the slope of the function <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Gescheider, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kingdom &amp; Prins, 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McCarley &amp; Yamani, 2021)</ref>. Here, a steeper curve is indicative of higher discriminability and sensory sensitivity and results in a smaller JND. because we had no a priori reasons to expect flatter slopes in specific conditions the models were re-fitted after excluding these participants. Both PSE and JND violated the assumption of normality and were therefore analysed through Wilcoxon sign-rank tests. To this end, the 2 x 2 design of metabolic status and target odour had to be recoded into a single grouping variable with four levels (hungry + food target, sated + food target, hungry + non-food target, sated + non-food target). the reported hunger was lower during the sated than the hungry session ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2C</ref>).</p><p>As mentioned above, due to technical problems, hunger ratings for the sated condition were not recorded for two subjects. These subjects' hunger ratings in the hungry condition were 62 and 100. They also consumed 749.31 and 616.48 kcals in the breakfast session, respectively, making it likely that the hunger manipulation had the intended effect. They were therefore included in the remainder of the study. A paired samples t-test showed that the average reported alertness was not statistically significant between conditions (N = 34; t(33) = -0.67, p = 0.505, Cohen's d = -0.116, 95% CI <ref type="bibr">[-7.69, 3.86]</ref>).</p></div>

We observed significant main effects of target odour (F(3, 105) = 3.99, Œ∑ 2 p = 0.102, p = 0.010) and timepoint of assessment (pre-vs. post-task; F(1, 35) = 6.24, Œ∑ 2 p = 0.151, p = 0.017) on pleasantness ratings, as well as an interaction between the two (F(3, 105) = 4.789, Œ∑ 2 p = 0.120, p = 0.004). Post-hoc t-tests with Holm correction demonstrated that the vegetable broth odour drove the significant effects. The pleasantness of this stimulus was significantly lower post-compared to pre-task (t <ref type="formula">35</ref>  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref>). Equivalence testing confirmed that the broth stimulus's pleasantness was not equivalent at the two timepoints (p = 0.725, Hedges's g(z) = 0.568). Comparisons of the remaining three odours' pleasantness at both time points demonstrated equivalence or inconclusive results, and the same was true for the comparisons between all four odours at pretask assessment. Results of these tests can be found in the supplementary materials. For the test of pleasantness for food vs. non-food odours, neither the odour type (F(1, 39) = 1.465, Œ∑ 2 p = 0.029, p = 0.233) nor the metabolic status (F(1, 39) = 0.001, Œ∑ 2 p = 0.006, p = 0.980) nor their interaction (F(1, 39) = 1.136, Œ∑ 2 p = 0.07, p = 0.293) returned significant. In summary, the vegetable broth odour was rated as significantly less pleasant post-task compared to pre-task, whereas no significant differences were found for the other odours, nor for food versus nonfood odours or the effects of metabolic status ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>).</p><p>Intensity. Neither odour (F(3, 105) = 1.535, Œ∑ 2 p = 0.042, p = 0.210) or timepoint (F(1, 35) = 1.394, Œ∑ 2 p = 0.038, p = 0.246) main effects nor their interaction (F(3, 105) = 0.120, Œ∑ 2 p = 0.003, p = 0.948) were significant predictors of odour intensity ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2B</ref>). Equivalence testing confirmed that at the pre-defined effect size, all four odours were equally intense at the precompared to the post-task assessment. Results of these tests can be found in the supplementary materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2. Experimental results</head><p>(A) Ratings of odour pleasantness at pre-and post-task assessment for each of the four odour targets. A significant reduction of pleasantness was observed for the vegetable broth but none of the other stimuli, so there is no strong reason to believe that repeated exposure influenced perception in this study. (B) Ratings of odour intensity pre-and post-task assessment for each of the four odour targets. There were no significant changes over time for any of the odours. (C) Self-reported hunger ratings were compared in the two experimental sessions (with vs. without standardised breakfast). All participants were less hungry after eating, which shows that the experimental manipulation had the intended effect. (D) Response time (mean ¬± SEM) across the odour target dilution for each combination of target identity (food vs. non-food) and metabolic status (hungry vs. sated). RTs are shortest for pure odours, which are easiest to identify, and longest for mixtures with equal parts of two odours. Food odours were identified faster than non-food odours, independent of which target the participants were asked to identify.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response time</head><p>A Wilcoxon signed-rank test, collapsed across target and metabolic status levels, confirmed that RT followed a basic inverted U-shaped pattern, with the lowest reaction times for pure odours and the longest RTs around the midpoints of the dilution series ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2C)</ref>, indicating increased task difficulty with more equal mixture levels between the two odours in the battery.</p><p>Concentration comparisons were statistically significant (all p &lt; 0.001), except for the comparisons between levels 25% and 75%, (W = 262088, padj = 0.588) and between 0% and 100% (W = 263455, padj = 0.588), respectively, indicating higher decision difficulty for more balanced odour mixtures. Comparing the two levels of metabolic state, collapsed across target, through a Wilcoxon sign-ranked test showed no response time differences between hungry and sated conditions at any of the five odour concentrations (all p &gt; 0.1). Significant differences between food and non-food targets were observed at 0% target odour concentration (W= 101216, p &lt; 0.001), as well as 25% (W = 54311, p = 0.022) and 100% (W = 22131, p &lt; 0.001).</p><p>These findings suggest faster decision-making on trials with pure or near-pure food odours, independent of whether food was attended or not ( <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>).</p><p>The best-fitting mixed effects model <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2</ref>; Nparameters = 10) had a substantial total explanatory power (conditional R 2 = 0.36), and partial explanatory power for the fixed effects alone (marginal R 2 ) was 0.13. The estimated model intercept was 1.25 (p &lt; .001) and translated to a back-transformed RT of ~ 3.49 seconds for pure non-food odours during hungry states, when participants did not consider an attended food target dominant (response "no"). There were large effects of both the linear (p &lt; .001) as well as the quadratic term of target concentration (p &lt; .001). Taken together these terms indicated that with increasing odour concentration RT first increased, mainly driven by the positive effect of the linear term (e 0.155 = 1.168), and then decreased again as the negative influence of the quadratic terms became larger (e -0.017 = 0.983). Metabolic status did not predict RT (p = 0.248). Target influenced RT through a negative simple effect of very small effect size (p &lt; .001), as well as through interactions with both the linear (p &lt; .001) and quadratic odour concentration (p = 0.036). RT was thus shorter (e -0.272 = 0.762) for non-food compared to food target condition with target odour concentration of 0%; or phrased differently, RT was shorter for pure food compared to pure non-food odours.</p><p>The two interactions showed that RT increased with increasing odour concentration for nonfood compared to food targets (e 0.085-0.003 = 1.086). Lastly, there was a significant main effect of response (p &lt; .001), indicating that while all other factors are fixed at 0, identifying the target odour as dominant was associated with a ~10% decrease in RT (e -0.095 = 0.909). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response behaviour</head><p>We fitted a logistic mixed-effects model <ref type="table">(Table 5</ref>; Nparameters = 8) to participants' responses from the perception task. The model's total explanatory power was substantial (conditional R 2 = 0.77, marginal R 2 = 0.76) with an intercept at -5.920 (p &lt; .001) indicating that when all factors were fixed to 0 (odour concentration 0%, food target, RT = 0, hungry session) the likelihood of identifying the target as dominant was &lt; 1% ( ‚àí5.920 1 + ‚àí5.920 ‚ÅÑ = 0.003). There was a small positive effect of metabolic status (p &lt; .001) indicating that the odds of a "yes" response increased by 97% in sated participants, compared to hungry, when keeping all other factors stable. We observed a large positive effect of target concentration (p &lt; .001) where endorsement of a dominant target odour was ~2.5 times more likely with each level increase of odour concentration. This effect of target concentration differed depending on the type of target, as was seen in an interaction with target (p = 0.038) that was of very small effect size. This interaction suggests that while increasing target concentration generally increased the likelihood of a yes response, this effect was attenuated (by ~ 9.4%) for non-food targets. In other words, participants are less sensitive to changes in concentration when the target is nonfood compared to food. There also was a large positive effect of target (p &lt; .001), whereby the likelihood of perceiving a non-food target as dominant was substantially larger (e 3.259 = 26.02) than perceiving food to be dominant when all other factors were kept at 0. A small, negative interaction with metabolic status (p &lt; .001) showed that for non-food targets the likelihood of identifying the target odour as dominant was larger in hungry compared to sated states. For each subject, we fitted a psychometric function for each combination of metabolic status and target and all models had a (very) good fit to the data ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref>). Psychometric group functions are displayed in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A</ref>. In line with the effect of target demonstrated by the mixed effects regression, Holm-corrected Wilcoxon sign-ranked tests of PSE ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3D</ref>) indicated significant differences between the conditions. Specifically, food targets presented in a hungry state had a higher PSE than both hungry (W = 592, padj &lt; 0.001) and sated (W = 587, padj&lt; 0.001) non-food conditions; and the same was true for food targets presented in the sated state compared to hungry (W = 582, padj&lt; 0.001) and sated (W = 517, padj &lt; 0.001) non-food targets.</p><p>Moreover, the two food target conditions had statistically different PSEs (W = 443, padj = 0.024), with a higher PSE for hungry subjects. Thus, the concentration where the target was determined to be dominant 50% of the time was much higher for food than non-food targets, and this bias was stronger when subjects were hungry rather than sated. Conversely, the two non-food conditions were not statistically different from one another (W = 209, padj= 0.134), indicating that hunger did not influence the dominance perception of non-food targets. Analysis of JND ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3C</ref>) showed no group differences for any of the comparisons (all padj= 1). Food targets were perceived to be dominant at higher concentrations than non-food target and this effect was stronger in the hungry state. Thus, decisions-making was most conservative for hungry subjects that were asked to rate perceptual dominance of food targets. (C) The justnoticeable difference did not differ across the conditions. (D) Points of subjective equality describe the shift of the curves in figures (A) and (B), with more conservative decisions for food odours, especially when hungry. There was no difference between the PSEs for hungry and sated conditions in non-food target blocks. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this study, we tested whether increased metabolic need and attentional modulation can influence deviance perception in food and non-food odour. Our data support the notion that metabolic need induces a generalised preferential processing and heightened contamination sensitivity. These effects are largely resistant to attentional modulation. Specifically, hunger did not encourage higher deviation tolerance to contamination in food odour, but rather, increased sensitivity to such deviations. Our findings indicate that relevant content and metabolic need can influence deviance processing in olfactory perception, leading to amplification of potential contaminants, especially in situations where food consumption is likely imminent. We propose that these results are indicative of a functional mechanism tuned towards preferential detection of food stimuli and signs of contamination to promote food intake and avoidance of accidental contamination.</p><p>Response times followed an inverted U-shape pattern across the odour dilution series, with the longest times observed at mid-range odour concentrations, indicating increased decision difficulty at these levels. This quadratic relationship between response times and odour concentration is consistent with previous reports of decision-making processes in olfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bowman et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Shanahan et al., 2021)</ref> and other sensory modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ding &amp; Gold, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Palmer et al., 2005)</ref>. In line with previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Boesveldt et al. (2010)</ref>, the fastest responses were recorded for pure food odours, and this effect was robust to attentional manipulation. This expected quadratic relationship between response times and odour concentration is consistent with previous reports of decision-making processes in olfaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bowman et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Shanahan et al., 2021)</ref> as well as other sensory modalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ding &amp; Gold, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Palmer et al., 2005</ref>).</p><p>Participants' response behaviour indicated, as expected, that the likelihood of identifying a target odour as dominant increased with target odour concentration. Consistent with the idea of olfactory pattern completion, we had further hypothesised that attentional manipulation would result in a response curve shift away from the attended odour, where attending a stimulus would pre-activate a search template and thus perceptually amplify the odour. Such a shift would be indicative of the target being perceptually dominant and thus identified at lower concentrations than when it was unattended. Our data, however, showed that independently of the attentional manipulation, the increase in reported dominance was much larger at low concentrations for non-food target compared to food-target blocks, indicating a response bias towards detection of the non-food stimulus regardless of attentional manipulation. This finding aligns with the psychometric perceptual choice curves, where analysis showed that points of subjective equality, i.e. the concentration at which both odours are perceived as dominant on 50% of the trials, were significantly lower for non-food targets. More specifically, a non-food odour target was perceived as dominant on half of the trials at concentrations &lt; 40%, while food targets achieved the same level of perceived dominance at concentrations ‚â• 60%. This means, that participants were more conservative when judging a food compared to a non-food odour.</p><p>Notably, the PSE of the hungry food target condition was higher than that for the sated condition. In that way, hunger made people even more conservative or, differently put, a nonfood contaminant gained perceptual dominance over a food odour at even lower concentrations during hunger than when the participant was sated. This finding is at odds with Shanahan et al.</p><p>(2021) who indicated that subjects were less likely to identify a food odour as dominant after food consumption, but only if the ingested meal matched the food odour stimulus. In the current study, a large effect of the target's identity made the endorsement of a non-food odour as dominant more likely than that of a food odour. The observed interaction of metabolic status with target odour identity indicates a higher sensitivity to contamination in food compared to non-food odours, which was further amplified by hunger. Taken together, these behavioural patterns of hungry participants indicate a perceptual bias towards the detection of non-food odours in food-non-food mixtures; an interpretation in line with a meta-analysis of the effects of hunger on odour identification, suggesting that fasting makes participants sensitive to nonfood, but not food, odours <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Nie et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Perceptual enhancement of a non-food within a food odour in a hungry state could present an evolutionary safety mechanism to increase focus on contamination avoidance when food intake is imminent. Hungry individuals are likely to consume available food, making it crucial to ensure that potential food is edible and that contamination risk is low. Our data indicate that hungry individuals demonstrate increased contamination sensitivity, where the olfactory sensory systems is attuned to potential contaminants, leading to stricter definitions of what is considered edible. Such an adaptation would result in a more selective definition of the "food" object category and enhance our ability to avoid ingesting harmful substances. Revisiting the aforementioned banana example, the smell of a slightly mouldy banana may still be considered a variant of the stereotypical banana when sated, while it would be categorised as a distinct object from fresh and edible bananas when hungry. In practical terms, while sated individuals might perceive a broader range of items as food, hungry individuals adopt a more conservative approach, requiring higher concentrations of food-related cues before recognising an odour as predominantly food. This adaptive mechanism could minimise the risk of consuming spoiled or contaminated food when the drive to eat is strongest. This idea seems to be contradictory to the concept of recognition invariance, an objecthood criterion listed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Stevenson (2014)</ref> which states that because objects are defined by their functional goals they are the default mode of perception. Because focussing attention on different aspects of a sensory stimulus is part of goal-directed behaviour it is conceivable that the functional goal of feeding may not only guide attention but may also redefine the width of an object category to in-or exclude (in)edible exemplars.</p><p>The current study has some limitations that should be addressed in future research. Firstly, we used two food and two non-food odours that had the benefit of reducing odour-dependent effects. However, these do not represent the full spectrum of possible odours and their variations in pleasantness and recognisability. While we aimed to include odours of equivalent intensity and pleasantness, liking of the odours were differentially affected by the repeated exposure during the experiment. In particular, the pleasantness of the broth odour, was rated relatively low by some participants, which could have influenced our results. Because we were mainly interested in the categories of food and non-food and not specific odours, we collapsed across odours to analyse category averages, which reduced the influence of individual pleasantness ratings. Moreover, the effectiveness of our attention manipulation remains unclear. A significant interaction between target and metabolic status and shifts in the perceptual choice curves indicated a bias towards non-food odours (irrespective of target identity), which was more extreme for hungry participants. From these behavioural results alone, it is not clear if guided attention in the perceptual decision-making task had different effects on the detection of food versus non-food odours. Generally, a shift of the psychometric response curve does not give information on whether there was a shift in perception or whether subjects had a behavioural bias to press a certain key (corresponding to yes or no) in situations of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Garc√≠a-P√©rez &amp; Alcal√°-Quintana, 2013)</ref>. The fact that response times were always fastest for food odours irrespective of which target condition the subject was in, supports the idea of differential processing of foods and non-foods irrespective of attentional focus. Future studies should try to untangle these possibilities, possibly through the inclusion of a baseline condition, with no instructions regarding the attending of a target, or the investigation of potentially different effects of an attentional focus manipulation on food and non-food odours.</p><p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that perceptual content and metabolic state interact during perceptual dominance evaluations in odours in a way which is resistant to task instructions.</p><p>Future research can build on our findings to further elucidate the complex interplay between attention, metabolic status, and odour perception. Our results highlight a perceptual bias towards non-food odours and an adaptive mechanism that enhances sensitivity to potential food contaminants when hungry. This research advances our understanding of olfactory perception, with implications for eating behaviour interventions and food marketing strategies.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>a suboptimal fit for two subjects (R2 &lt; 0.2;<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">McFadden, 1977)</ref> and</figDesc></figure>
