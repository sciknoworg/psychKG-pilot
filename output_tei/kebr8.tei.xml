			<abstract>
				<p>Finding an optimal decision-making strategy requires a careful balance between the competing demands of accuracy and urgency. In experimental settings, researchers are typically interested in whether people can optimise this trade-off, typically operationalised as reward rate, with evidence accumulation models serving as the key framework to determine whether people are performing optimally. However, recent studies have suggested that inferences about optimality can be highly dependent on the task design, meaning that inferences about whether people can achieve optimality may not generalise across contexts. Here, we investigate one typically overlooked design factor: whether participants spend a fixed amount of time on each block (fixed-time) or have a fixed number of trials in each block (fixed-trials). While fixed-time designs are typically thought to be the most appropriate for optimality studies, as to maximise the number of correct responses participants must optimise RR, our Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that people are at least as good at optimising reward rate under fixed-trial designs as fixed-time designs. However, Experiment 3 provides some evidence that fixed-trial designs with no instructions may not be at least as good as fixed-time designs with very specific instructions. Importantly, these findings challenge the idea that fixed-time designs are the most appropriate for reward rate optimality studies, and further emphasise the importance of carefully considering study design factors when making inferences about optimality in decision-making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>An optimal decision-making strategy in natural settings balances the competing demands of accuracy and urgency in relation to the goals, motivations and resources of the decider <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anderson, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Khodadadi, Fakhari, &amp; Busemeyer, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">van Ravenzwaaij, van der Maas, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2012)</ref>. For an individual who wants to be accurate and has plenty of time to achieve this goal, being cautious would be the optimal strategy, as more urgent strategies would unnecessarily reduce accuracy. However, for another individual, being fast and less accurate may be optimal given their unique circumstances. In experimental paradigms, one way to avoid the subjectivity and variability inherent in individual goals -which in turn, influence the optimal strategy -is to define optimal decision-making in terms of maximising reward rate. From this perspective, optimality can be described as the best way to balance the trade-off between the speed and accuracy of a decision, with strategies that are too cautious/urgent producing non-optimal outcomes.</p><p>Reward rate (RR), typically defined as the rate at which correct decisions are produced, is a metric commonly used in the evidence accumulation modelling (EAM) literature when investigating optimal decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bogacz, Brown, Moehlis, Holmes, &amp; Cohen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Simen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bogacz, Hu, Holmes, &amp; Cohen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Drugowitsch, DeAngelis, Angelaki, &amp; Pouget, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Evans &amp; Brown, 2017)</ref>. EAMs are the dominant framework for rapid decision-making, with their basic assumption being that evidence is accumulated for the different decision options, until sufficient evidence is reached for one of the options, and a response is triggered. EAMs are able to inform researchers about the decision process by analysing choice response time data to reveal latent variables, such as decision-making ability relative to task difficulty (drift rate, v ), decision boundary where responses are triggered (threshold, a), response biases (z ), and encoding/motor response time (ter ) (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ratcliff, Smith, Brown, &amp;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">McKoon, 2016 and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Wagenmakers, 2020</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>for reviews).</head><p>A cautious decider would set their threshold higher, accumulating more information to ensure a better chance of a correct decision, and subsequently take longer to make their decision. In contrast, a less cautious decider would set a lower threshold, not take as long to choose, but would produce fewer correct decisions.</p><p>In the context of optimal decision-making, EAMs are able to estimate not only how cautious a person is in completing a task, but also how cautious they should have been in order to maximise their RR. However, previous research has come to contrasting conclusions about the ability of humans to adopt RR optimal strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Simen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Evans &amp; Brown, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Evans, Bennett, &amp; Brown, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Balci et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Starns &amp; Ratcliff, 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hawkins, Brown, Steyvers, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Evans &amp; Hawkins, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Evans, Hawkins, &amp; Brown, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Trueblood, Heathcote, Evans, &amp; Holmes, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Drugowitsch, Moreno-Bote, Churchland, Shadlen, &amp; Pouget, 2012)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Simen et al. (2009)</ref> showed that participants could adapt their speed-accuracy trade-off and response biases when subject to changing task conditions, to maximise RR and attain optimal or near optimal thresholds. In contrast, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Evans and Brown (2017)</ref> showed that people can become more optimal in their decision-making when provided practice and feedback, their general findings still supported the notion that caution is the default behaviour, though subsequent research by  suggested that default behaviour is approximately optimal under conditions with longer timeouts after errors. Other studies have also suggested people become sub-optimally cautious as task difficulty increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balci et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns &amp; Ratcliff, 2012)</ref>, showing a qualitative disagreement with optimal behaviour. These conflicting results have somewhat limited general conclusions about whether humans are able to -and if so, whether they choose to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hawkins et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns &amp; Ratcliff, 2012</ref>) -adopt RR optimal decision strategies.</p><p>One explanation for some of these conflicting findings is that participants' ability to achieve optimality may be heavily dependent on the task design <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Simen et al., 2009)</ref>. Specifically, the optimal level of caution for a given situation depends on a large number of factors outside of the participants direct control. For example, given all other factors are equal, participants who are worse at the task (i.e., with lower drift rates) should be more urgent than those who are better at the task, as there is little benefit from sampling more information due to the low quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bogacz et al., 2006)</ref>. The pace of the task -often operationalised as the response-stimulus interval (RSI), the time between the participant's response and the stimulus presentation in the next trial -also influences the optimal strategy, as slower tasks designs mean that a lot of time is already being wasted regardless of participant speed, making being more cautious optimal <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Simen et al., 2009)</ref>. More generally, any factor that can influence the total task time or the ability to gain rewards can influence the precise optimal strategy, meaning that participants may be better able to achieve optimality in circumstances where the task optimality demands align with default strategies. In line with this explanation,  were able to create a task design where on average participants were in line with the optimal strategy, suggesting that task design elements may explain some of the previous conflicting findings in RR optimality research.</p><p>One important task design factor, which has received limited empirical investigation, is whether participants spend a fixed amount of time on each block -meaning that the number of trials they complete in each block is variable (i.e., fixed-time design) -or complete a fixed number of trials in each block -meaning that the time spent on each block is variable (i.e., fixed-trial design). Importantly, fixed-time designs create a situation where the amount of time spent on the task (i.e., the overall "rate" at which people are able to obtain rewards) is constant, and participants are able to complete more trials to gain more chances at correct responses by performing faster, making that the optimal strategies for maximizing the total number of rewards and maximizing the RR are identical.</p><p>Fixed-time designs are also common in non-human primate decision-making studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Roitman &amp; Shadlen, 2002)</ref>, which have often concluded that non-human primates behave in a near-optimal manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Hawkins, Forstmann, Wagenmakers, Ratcliff, &amp; Brown, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>In contrast, fixed-trial designs allow participants to spend as long as they like on the task, creating a situation where maximizing the total number of rewards requires an extremely cautious strategy, whereas maximizing RR requires a careful balancing of speed and accuracy. The natural requirement in fixed-time designs of carefully balancing of speed and accuracy to maximize the total number of rewards, as opposed to fixed-trial designs where these goals are competing, has lead to several studies exclusively using fixed-time conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balci et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bogacz et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Simen et al., 2009)</ref>, showcasing an assumption in the literature that fixed-time designs are better suited than fixed-trial designs to studying RR optimality.</p><p>However, in the limited number of experiments that have included both fixed-time and fixed-trial conditions (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>), the findings have been mixed. In line with the assumption that people are better at optimizing RR under fixed-time conditions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns and Ratcliff (2012)</ref> found that while participants were generally sub-optimal -both quantitatively, and qualitatively when faced with a difficulty manipulation -those who performed the task under fixed-time conditions were generally closer to optimality than those who performed the task under fixed-trial conditions. However, as the goal of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns and Ratcliff (2012)</ref> was to assess age related differences in optimality, and both fixed-time and fixedtrial conditions were largely present to ensure robustness of the core results, they did not attempt to make these conditions as equivalent as possible, or make any strong conclusions about differences between the designs. For example, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns and Ratcliff (2012)</ref> explicitly instructed those in the fixed-time condition to try and achieve RR optimality, with feedback about the number of correct responses provided after each block, this was not the case for those in the fixed-trial condition, who performed the task with limited experimenter input. In contrast to these results, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Evans and Brown (2017)</ref> consistently found participants to be closer to optimality under fixed-trial conditions than fixed-time conditions, with the instructions and feedback in both conditions design to be as equivalent as possible in encouraging participants to achieve RR optimality. Importantly, these conflicting findings make it unclear whether -and if so, how -the task design factor of fixed-time/trials influences participant's ability to achieve optimality.</p><p>The current study aims to provide a more comprehensive investigation into whether people behave more optimally in fixed-time designs compared to fixed-trial designs. Specifically, the current study focuses on assessing two of the key experimental design factors that differed between the studies of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns and Ratcliff (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Evans and Brown (2017)</ref>; the instructions and feedback given to participants (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Specifically, Experiment 1 manipulates both whether participants are placed under fixed-time or fixed-trial conditions, as well as whether participants are given no specific instructions about their performance goal in the task or told to maximise RR, with all participants receiving feedback after each block about their accuracy, response time, and RR. Experiment 2 uses the same manipulations as Experiment 1, but participants are not given any information about RR after blocks. Finally, Experiment 3 attempts to replicate the instruction differences between the fixed-time and fixed-trial conditions from Starns and Ratcliff (2012) -as well as the lack of error timeouts in the task, which can influence inferences about optimality <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Simen et al., 2009)</ref> -while using the same experimental task as <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Evans and Brown (2017)</ref>. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>Method It should be noted that the data for the "None-Time" and "None-Trial" groups were previously used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Crüwell and Evans (2021)</ref>, where these groups were compared as part of an example for the preregistration template developed in that article.</p><p>Participants. For Experiment 1, 133 undergraduate students were recruited from the University of Newcastle, who completed the experiment online for course credit under protocols approved by the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee.</p><p>Participants were assigned to one of four groups: "None-Time" (33), "None-Trial" (30), "RR-Time" (35), "RR-Trial" (35). We defined an exclusion criterion of 60% accuracy, where the 31 participants who scored below this criterion were excluded. Furthermore, we excluded only one further participant across the "None-Time" and "RR-Time" groups who completed less than 200 total trials across the entire task, as this would mean that they completed less than 10 trials on average per block, making reliable block-by-block analyses of threshold (a) changes difficult. These exclusions resulted in 101 participants remaining for analysis (None-Time=27, None-Trial=23, RR-Time=26, RR Trial=25).</p><p>Task and Procedure. The study was administered with either a fixed amount of time per block ("Time") or a fixed number of trials per block ("Trial"), with participants either receiving explicit instructions that encourage them to pursue RR optimality ("RR") or typical instructions from the decision-making literature with no clear performance goal ("None"); see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> for an overview. For the "Time" groups, each block was 60 seconds in duration with participants completing as many trials as possible, and for the "Trial" groups, each block consisted of 40 trials for participants to complete at their own pace.</p><p>Participants completed a total of 20 blocks, meaning that those in the "Trial" groups completed 800 trials, and those in the "Time" groups spent 1200 seconds (20 minutes) completing trials.</p><p>At commencement, participants were provided with general information about the study, then indicated their consent by continuing on to the task. Participants were then presented with a screen with general information about the task; a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) random dot kinematogram, where participants had to judge whether a cloud of dots appeared to be moving towards the top-left or top-right of the screen. After these initial instructions, those in the "None" groups then began the task, whilst those in the "RR" groups were presented with additional instructions explaining that they would receive points for correct answers, and encouraging them to get as many points as possible per minute 2 . During each trial, participants were presented with 40 white dots contrasted on a black background, where 4 dots (i.e., 10%) were moving coherently towards either the top-left or top-right of the screen, with dot movement and direction generated using the white-noise algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pilly &amp; Seitz, 2009)</ref>. Participants were told to press either the "z" key if they decided that the cloud of dots appeared to be moving to the top-left, or the "/" key if they decided that the cloud of dots appeared to be moving to the top-right.</p><p>Anticipatory responses, defined as responses quicker than 250ms, produced a "Too Fast!" message, and the task timed out for 1500ms before proceeding to the next trial.</p><p>Depending on response accuracy, post trial feedback produced either a "Correct" message presented for 500ms, or an "Incorrect" message presented for 1500ms, followed by a 500ms</p><p>inter-trial interval, before proceeding to the next trial. In Experiment 1, participants were given a "medium" (i.e., as defined in Evans &amp; Brown, 2017) level of feedback after each block -from the end of block 4 onwards -summarising their RR performance.</p><p>Design and Data Analysis. We treated Experiment 1 as a 2 (Task Type: Time, Trial) * 2 (Instruction Type: RR, None) between-subjects design. We excluded responses faster than 250ms and slower than 10000ms, assuming that these reflected anticipatory responses and lapses in attention, respectively. Some basic descriptive statistics for all three experiments can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>We used the full 3 diffusion model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ratcliff &amp; Rouder, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ratcliff &amp; Tuerlinckx, 2002)</ref> to estimate parameters for drift rate (v ), threshold (a), starting point (z ), and non-decision time (ter ) -as well as between-trial variability in drift rate (sv ), starting point (sz ), and non-decision time (ster ) -with two different model parameterisations used for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of data. The full diffusion model can account for characteristics commonly found in data from perceptual decision-making tasks, such as slow errors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Ratcliff &amp; McKoon, 2008)</ref>. Each of the four groups were assessed separately in their qualitative agreement with RR optimality, and then quantitative pairwise comparisons were used to determine whether some groups were closer to optimality than others.</p><p>RR was calculated as the accuracy rate divided by the average time spent on each trial; specifically, P C M RT +IT I+F DT +(1−P C) * ET , where M RT reflects the mean response time, and P C reflects the accuracy, IT I reflects the inter-trial interval, F DT reflects the feedback display time, and ET reflects the additional timeout for error responses 4 . Optimal thresholds (a) were those that maximised RR across the range of 0.01 to 4 -in increments of 0.01 -and were determined as a function of the other parameters (v, z, ter, sv, sz, ster ).</p><p>As no solutions exist to determine the RR for each possible threshold in the full diffusion model (though see <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bogacz et al., 2006</ref> for a solution for the simple diffusion model), we determined the RR for each possible threshold through simulation using the method and framework of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Evans (2019)</ref>. Specifically, for the RR calculation of each possible threshold, we simulated 2000 trials with a step size of 10 milliseconds and a maximum decision time of 10 seconds, which created an extremely large computational burden in our quantitative analysis.</p><p>In all cases, models were estimated through Bayesian hierarchical model estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Shiffrin, Lee, Kim, &amp; Wagenmakers, 2008)</ref>, where the parameter estimates of each individual are constrained to follow group-level distributions. The exact model structures and prior specifications can be seen in the Supplementary Materials. The posterior distributions were estimated through differential-evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo <ref type="bibr">(DE-MCMC;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Ter Braak, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Turner, Sederberg, Brown, &amp; Steyvers, 2013)</ref>, which allows for efficient movement through correlated dimensions by using the current samples from each chain to inform the proposals of other chains. The estimation process used 3k chains, were k is the number of free parameters per individual subject, and sampled for a total of 4,000 iterations, with the first 1,000 iterations discarded as burn-in 5 . In all cases, the focus of estimation and inference was on the group-level parameters relating to threshold: the estimated threshold (a), and/or the distance of the estimated threshold from the optimal threshold.</p><p>The qualitative assessment involved estimating a model where threshold (a) was allowed to vary across blocks, with these block-by-block group-level posterior estimates of threshold compared to the group-level distribution of the optimal threshold 6 . The group-level distribution of the optimal threshold was calculated through taking all of the group-level posterior samples for v, z, and ter, and calculating the respective optimal a value for each sample, which formed an optimal threshold "posterior" distribution. The estimated posterior distributions for thresholds for each block, and the calculated "posterior" distributions for the optimal threshold across all blocks, were plotted for each group to qualitatively assess whether their thresholds get closer to optimality over time, how their thresholds differ from optimality (e.g., generally more cautious, optimal, or overly-urgent), and whether the groups seem to differ in their proximity to optimality. To ensure that the differences between actual and optimal thresholds did not differ too greatly between the group-level and individual-level, we also performed the qualitative analyses for each experiment at the individual-level, which provided qualitatively matching results to the equivalent group-level analyses (see the Supplementary Materials).</p><p>The quantitative assessment was only performed on the data from blocks 11-20, assuming that participants had approximately converged on their chosen threshold by block 11, though perhaps not beforehand, based on the plots from the qualitative analysis. This involved estimating the difference from optimality for each participant (i.e., c</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">i = a i -b i ,</formula><p>where b i is the optimal threshold for person i), and a group-level distribution for the difference parameter c. To make inferences about which groups appeared to be closer to optimality than other groups, we estimated models for the pairwise comparisons between the 4 different groups, with ∆ c providing the estimate of the difference from optimality between the two groups. To provide inferences, we used the Savage-Dickey Density Ratio method <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wagenmakers, Lodewyckx, Kuriyal, &amp; Grasman, 2010)</ref> to approximate the Bayes factors.</p><p>more computationally taxing and difficult to estimate, and (2) the results of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Evans and Brown (2017)</ref> suggested that allowing drift rate to vary does not influence the results, as the optimal distribution does not systematically change over blocks</p><p>In total, we estimated 18 different models for Experiments 1 and 2: specifically, for each of the 6 pairwise comparisons between groups, we estimated 3 different types of models, aimed at helping to provide 3 different types of inferences. The three models comprised:</p><p>(1) a model with a normally distributed prior that was used for parameter estimation of the ∆ c parameter, and provided inferences about whether or not an effect appeared to be present;</p><p>(2) a model that restricted the prior of ∆ c in one direction (i.e., normally distributed prior with positive truncation), providing a model comparison between the hypotheses of Group A being closer to optimality than Group B, or there being no effect ("A vs Null"); (3) a model that restricted the prior of ∆ c in the other direction (normally distributed prior with negative truncation), providing a model comparison between the hypotheses of Group B being closer to optimality than Group A, or there being no effect ("B vs Null"). As the model with a normally distributed prior can only tell us if an effect is present, the two directional models (with truncated priors) can provide further insight into which of the two groups the effect is most likely to favour. Furthermore, as the Bayes factor is transitive, we also calculated an "A vs B" Bayes factor based on the previous two Bayes factors (i.e., A vs Null B vs Null ), comparing hypothesis A (i.e., Group A is closer to optimality than Group B) against hypothesis B (i.e., Group B is closer to optimality than Group A), to provide a direct assessment of whether fixed-time or fixed-trial appears most likely to be superior. 7</p><p>The strength of evidence provided by the Bayes factors was interpreted following van Doorn et al. <ref type="formula">2020</ref>and <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jeffreys (1961)</ref>. Bayes factors less than 3 or greater than 1 3 in 7 Also note that in addition to the regular Savage-Dickey Ratio, which only contrasts the densities of the posterior and the prior at 0, we also calculated a more conservative (i.e., more favourable to the null hypothesis) "adjusted" version, rather than calculating the Bayes factor based on the posterior density at exactly 0, instead uses the highest posterior density within a band very close to 0 (i.e., in our case, -0.02 &lt; x &lt; 0.02). While this calculation is less theoretically correct -and so we only present it alongside the regular Savage-Dickey Ratio, and base our interpretations on the regular Savage-Dickey Ratio -it provides some additional robustness against situations where the posterior density is quite peaked near 0, but not exactly at 0. magnitude indicate weak evidence, between 3 -10 or 1 -indicate moderate evidence, between -100 or 1 10 -1 indicate strong evidence, and greater than 100 or less than 1 100 indicate decisive evidence. Bayes factors above 1 indicate evidence for the alternate hypothesis, and Bayes factors below 1 indicate evidence for the null hypothesis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>For the qualitative assessment, plots comparing actual threshold to optimal threshold for each group revealed two general trends: that all groups were more cautious than optimality, and that all groups generally came closer to optimality over the later blocks (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1a</ref>). The None-Trial group most closely exhibited these trends, and also came the closest to achieving optimality, though the posterior median for their actual thresholds always remained outside of the bands of their optimal distribution. In contrast, trends for the None-Time group appeared to be the most variable and the furthest from achieving optimality, with trends for the two RR groups somewhere in between the two None groups.</p><p>The first few blocks of each group also showed higher variability in median threshold values, with some point estimates nearly at optimal, likely reflecting some initial threshold adjustments while participants adapted to the task.</p><p>For the quantitative assessment, Bayes factors based on the Savage-Dickey Ratios for the pairwise comparisons between groups are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 3</ref>, with graphical representation of the estimated posterior distributions for the model with a normally distributed prior in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2a</ref>. When only looking at the comparisons of any effect against the null, all comparisons showed weak evidence for either an effect or the null. However, when looking at directional hypotheses, we found moderate evidence in favour of None-Trial being closer to optimality than None-Time (compared to the null and the inverse), and moderate evidence in favour of RR-Trial being closer to optimality than None-Time (compared to the null and the inverse). Importantly, these results seem to suggest that people are at least as MRT -median reaction time; PC -proportion correct; "RR" in the Group column refers to instruction type which encourages RR optimality; RR column provides numerical values for RR as per formula detailed in the main text.</p><p>close to optimality under fixed-trial conditions as they are under fixed-time conditions, and people are potentially even closer to optimality under fixed-trial conditions compared to fixed-time conditions -though the latter inference could be due to the poorer performance of the None-Time group.</p></div>

Furthermore, we excluded only one further participant across the "None-Time" and "RR-Time" groups who completed less than 200 total trials across the entire task, as this would mean that they completed less than 10 trials on average per block, making reliable block-by-block analyses of threshold (a) changes difficult. These exclusions resulted in 182 participants remaining for analysis (None-Time=50, None-Trial=41, RR-Time=43, RR Trial=48).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>For the qualitative assessment, plots comparing actual threshold to optimal threshold for each group revealed the same two general trends as Experiment 1: that all groups were more cautious than optimality (even more so than Experiment 1), and that all groups became closer to optimality over blocks (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1b)</ref>. In contrast to Experiment 1, the RR-Trial group appeared to most closely resemble these trends, followed by the RR-Time and None-Trial groups. The first few blocks of each group also showed higher variability in median threshold values, similar to Experiment1.</p><p>For the quantitative assessment, Bayes factors based on the Savage-Dickey Ratios for the pairwise comparisons between groups are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 4</ref>, with graphical representation of the estimated posterior distributions for the model with a normally distributed prior in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2b</ref>. When only looking at the comparisons of any effect against the null, all comparisons showed weak evidence for the null, except for the RR-Trial /None-Time group which showed weak evidence for an effect. However, when looking at directional hypotheses, we found strong evidence in favour of RR-Trial being closer to optimality than None-Time (compared to the null and the inverse), and moderate evidence in favour of RR-Trial being closer to optimality than None-Trial (compared to the null and the inverse)</p><p>and RR-Time (compared to the inverse), and moderate evidence in favour of RR-Time being closer to optimality than None-Time (compared to the inverse). Importantly, these results again seem to suggest that people are at least as close to optimality under fixed-trial conditions as they are under fixed-time conditions, and people are potentially even closer to optimality under fixed-trial conditions compared to fixed-time conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3</head><p>Interestingly, the results of both Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that people are at least as close to optimality under fixed-trial conditions as they are under fixed-time conditions; that is, that people are either closer to optimality under fixed-trial conditions or have equivalent proximity to optimality under both conditions. Importantly, these results suggest that people are not able to better optimise RR under fixed-time conditions. Experiment 3 attempts to address two key remaining differences between our study and the study of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns and Ratcliff (2012)</ref>. Specifically, while our previous experiments both provided manipulations of whether the instructions gave participants the goal of RR optimality, our RR Actual threshold values for each condition, compared to their optimal threshold. Circles represent median group level posterior threshold for each block (starting at block 2) with error bars showing the 95% quantiles. This is compared with the group averaged optimal threshold indicated by the coloured bands delineated by different shades of green. The lightest, centre band represents the 40 -60% quantile, the middle shade represent the 20 -40 % and 60 -80% quantiles, and the darkest shade the 10 -20% and 80 -90% quantiles. Thresholds above the optimal band indicate cautious behaviour, whilst those below the band indicate more urgent behaviour. where error feedback was presented for 1000ms longer than correct feedback (1500ms vs 368 500ms), which pushes the optimal strategy towards being more cautious and avoiding er-369 rors, whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns and Ratcliff (2012)</ref> presented correct and error feedback for an equal 370 amount of time (300ms each, with an inter-trial interval of 100ms). In Experiment 3, we address these differences by using instructions for the fixed-time group that are directly based on those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns and Ratcliff (2012)</ref>, and removing the error timeout from our previous experiments. However, it should be noted that there are still several differences between our Experiment 3 and <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns and Ratcliff (2012)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns and Ratcliff (2012)</ref> also included a between-block manipulation of difficulty -allowing them to have a more nuanced assessment of optimality regarding whether participants adapted to the difficult conditions in an optimal manner -as well as an assessment of aging effects, and utilised a different experimental task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>All methodological details of Experiment 3 were identical to Experiment 1, apart from the deviations noted here. Most notably, we simplified our design to only contain two groups that focused on the key comparison of interest: a RR-Time group, who received RR instructions based on those from <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns and Ratcliff (2012)</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(see the Supplementary</head><p>Materials for the exact instructions), and a None-Trial group, which were given the same instructions as the None-Trial groups from the previous experiments. Furthermore, posttrial feedback for both correct and incorrect responses were presented for 500ms. For Experiment 3, 71 undergraduate students were recruited from the University of Queensland, who completed the experiment online for course credit under protocols approved by the University of Queensland Human Research Ethics Committee. Participants were assigned to one of two groups: "None-Trial" (35) or "RR-Time" (36). We again defined an exclusion criterion of 60% accuracy, where the 13 participants who scored below this criterion were excluded. These exclusions resulted in 58 participants remaining for analysis (None-Trial=28, RR-Time=30).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>For the qualitative assessment, plots comparing actual threshold to optimal threshold for each group revealed the same two general trends as Experiments 1 and 2. First, both groups were more cautious than optimality, and to a greater extent than Experiments and 2 as the optimal band in Experiment 3 reflected an even more urgent strategy. Second, both groups became closer to optimality over blocks, though in contrast to Experiments 1 and 2, the fixed-time group -in this case, RR-Time -appeared to come closest to optimality. For the quantitative assessment, the results showed weak evidence for an effect between groups (Bayes factor [Effect vs Null] = 1.14), with the direct comparison between hypotheses that posited one group was closer to optimality than the other showing moderate evidence in favour of RR-Time being closer to optimality than None-Trial (Bayes factor <ref type="bibr">[A vs B]</ref> = 4.24). Furthermore, it should be noted that the results of the simple diffusion model came to somewhat different conclusions, showing weak evidence for no difference between in groups in all cases (see the Supplementary Materials), though our key interpretations focus on the full diffusion model. These results contrast with those of Experiment 1 and 2, and while they do not show a clear superiority of the fixed-time condition, they do indicate that people are not at least as optimal in the fixed-trial condition, suggesting that task instructions and/or pace may influence the conclusions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The current study aimed to provide a more comprehensive investigation into whether people behave more optimally in fixed-time designs compared to fixed-trial designs. While previous studies including both of these designs have been limited and showed mixed results <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Starns &amp; Ratcliff, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Evans &amp; Brown, 2017)</ref>, several other studies have exclusively used fixed-time conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balci et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bogacz et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Simen et al., 2009)</ref>, showcasing</p><p>an assumption in the literature that fixed-time designs are better suited than fixed-trial designs to studying RR optimality. The findings of Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that this is not the case, providing evidence that people were at least as close to optimality under  fixed-trial conditions as they were under fixed-time conditions. However, the findings of Experiment 3 contrast with those in Experiments 1 and 2, providing evidence that people were not at least as close to optimality under fixed-trial conditions as they were under fixed-time conditions. Importantly, Experiment 3 utilised task instructions and pacing that better matched those of <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns and Ratcliff (2012)</ref>; fixed-time participants were explicitly instructed to ignore errors, but fixed-trial participants were not given any specific instructions on how to perform the task. Together, these findings indicate that people are generally at least as good at optimizing RR under fixed-trial compared to fixedtime conditions, but that specific differences in instructions between groups may cause a superiority of fixed-time conditions. Furthermore, these findings may also be reflective of a general suggestion made by ; that people may actually be fairly resistant to changing their level of caution in many situations that can influence optimality, with fixed-time/fixed-trial designs potentially being one of these situations.</p><p>Our findings also provide further evidence for a common conclusion in the literature: that participants are generally more cautious than RR optimality dictates that they should be <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Evans &amp; Brown, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Balci et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Starns &amp; Ratcliff, 2012</ref>. Across all three experiments, we found that all groups were sub-optimally cautious, which became even more extreme in Experiment 3 where the error timeout was removed and an even more urgent strategy was required for optimality. Importantly, the latter finding reiterates the conclusion of some previous studies that have suggested that inference about participants' ability to achieve optimality may be dependent on task design, and more specifically, that the timeouts in the task can greatly influence how close people come to achieving RR optimality <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Simen et al., 2009)</ref>. Furthermore, while participants also generally moved closer to optimality over time -another common finding in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Evans &amp; Brown, 2017;</ref>-it is unclear how much of the change over time is due to an increased understanding of how to achieve optimality, or a range of other factors that would also cause a decrease in threshold, such as fatigue and/or boredom <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agrawal, Mattar, Cohen, &amp; Daw, 2022)</ref>.</p><p>More broadly, these findings further showcase the importance of better understanding why participants are sub-optimally cautious. While the current study seems to generally indicate that a specific factor -fixed time vs fixed trial designs -does not influence conclusions about optimality, our knowledge remains limited on the broader questions of why people are sub-optimal, and whether they can adapt to become optimal. While some previous studies have found people to behave approximately optimal in some conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Simen et al., 2009)</ref>, these were cases where the task design was modified to make the optimal strategy a more cautious one, meaning that participants may have only been close to optimality by default, rather than by choice. Based on the findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Evans and Brown (2017)</ref>, where people came close to optimality when given specific feedback on how to adapt their performance, it is possible that participants are simply unaware of how exactly to optimise their performance. However, even with this extreme level of guidance people were still slightly too cautious, suggesting that making people aware of the optimal strategy may not be completely sufficient. Another potential explanation is that participants are simply not motivated to achieve optimality, and simply desire to get out of the experiment as quickly as possible (e.g., the Min-RT strategy; <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hawkins et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>However, this explanation seems inconsistent with the general finding of people being suboptimally cautious, as under this explanation we would expect people to be sub-optimally urgent. While it is possible that monetary rewards could better motivate people to achieve reward rate optimality, rather than sticking with their default strategy, non-monetarily rewarded instruction are common in other decision-making tasks and usually have high rates of compliance, such as instruction based manipulations of the speed-accuracy trade-off (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Evans, 2021)</ref>, suggesting that participants do not need monetary incentives to comply with instructions when they understand how to comply with them. More generally, while findings seem to indicate that RR optimality cannot provide a general explanation for how people behave, we believe that understanding why people are sub-optimal is an important research direction for understanding human behaviour.</p></div>
