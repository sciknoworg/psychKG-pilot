			<abstract>
				<p>Purpose: Eyewitness statements often determine the direction and the success of police investigations. However, eyewitnesses&apos; recollection of events may become inaccurate or even incorrect over time. Moreover, eyewitnesses&apos; expressed confidence in the quality of their statements tends to be a rather weak indicator of actual quality. The current study explores how different types of context reinstatement compare in terms of quality of eyewitness statements and how they influence the confidence-quality relationship. Of particular interest is a new type of context reinstatement: virtual context reinstatement. Methods: Participants (N = 98) were asked to take part in a group experiment in which an incident was staged. A week later, participants were subjected to virtual context reinstatement (VCR), physical context reinstatement (PCR), mental context reinstatement (MCR), or a no context reinstatement (control) procedure, and were subsequently asked to give an eyewitness statement. Results: During free recall, eyewitness statements in both the VCR and PCR conditions contained significantly less confabulated details compared to statements of participants in the control group. During cued recall, participants in the VCR condition reported more correct details in their statements than participants in the MCR and PCR conditions. Moreover, VCR appears to result in a stronger confidence-quality relationship compared to the other types context reinstatement. Conclusions: PCR and VCR showed fewest confabulated details in eyewitness statements and are therefore most beneficial to police investigations. The stronger confidence-quality relationship as a result of VCR can help to support the decision-making process of police investigators and other professionals who rely on eyewitness statements.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Eyewitness statements are indispensable when it comes to investigating and solving crimes.</p><p>The majority of the body of evidence in police investigations consists of eyewitness statements (De Poot, Bokhorst, Van <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Koppen &amp; Muller, 2004)</ref> and suspects are often traced -and regularly convicted -based on evidence that (almost) exclusively originates from eyewitnesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Wolters &amp; Odinot, 2010)</ref>. This makes accurate recollection of events by eyewitnesses extremely important. However, memories tend to fade -and possibly deform -over time, causing eyewitness statements to be incomplete or to contain incorrect information. In order to validate the statements, police investigators often simply ask eyewitnesses to indicate how confident they are that the information in their statements is accurate  as expressed confidence is often the most important indicator for statement quality for police officers and other professionals working with eyewitnesses <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Sporer, Penrod, Read, &amp; Cutler, 1995)</ref>. However, studies show that the confidence-quality relationship (also called the confidence-accuracy relationship) is generally weak (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sporer, Penrod, Read &amp; Cutler, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Odinot, Wolters &amp; van Koppen, 2009)</ref>, suggesting that police officers, jury members, and even court officials risk attaching either too much or too little value to a testimony based on an invalid indicator.</p><p>A way to improve the quality of eyewitness statements and the confidence-quality relationship is using context reinstatement. Context reinstatement is traditionally implemented in police practices by interviewing eyewitnesses at the crime scene (physical context reinstatement; PCR) or actively coaching eyewitnesses to think back of the crime scene (mental context reinstatement; MCR). Taking back the eyewitness by means of virtual reality may be a new and promising way to increase the accuracy of recollection. Virtual reality is a relatively new technique which can be used to vividly recreate places or situations -such as crime scenes -and experience them, without actually being there. Applying VCR in police investigations has several practical advantages. For one, as it is not always possible, desirable or useful to physically return to the scene of the crime. A crime scene may be closed for a long period of time or it has changed considerable since the crime was committed. In such situations, a virtual return to the original scene of the crime may be helpful. Another advantage of applying virtual reality is that it may reduce stress levels that can negatively affect the process of memory retrieval, because the eyewitness does not return to the actual crime scene. This, thirdly, also eliminates the risk of destroying or contaminating the forensic evidence that is present on the crime scene. This virtual type of context reinstatement is not described nor tested empirically in the scientific literature. As a consequence, it is unknown to what extent VCR leads to better eyewitness statements and how any possible effects relate to effects of PCR and MCR. Therefore, in this study eyewitnesses are exposed to a virtual reproduction of the original crime scene by means of virtual context reinstatement (VCR) and the results will be compared with PCR and MCR.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context reinstatement</head><p>Context reinstatement is the psychological principle that retrieving a particular memory is facilitated when someone re-experiences the environment in which the memory was stored <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Williams, 2006)</ref>. In literature, two types of context reinstatement are distinguished: physical context reinstatement (PCR) and mental context reinstatement (MCR). PCR entails that someone physically returns to the environment in which the memory was stored; the presence of the contextual cues actually stimulate the retrieval process. Context reinstatement can also be applied by having someone intensively think back to an event or situation, making relevant contextual cues mentally available. This is known as mental context reinstatement <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Smith, 1979</ref>).</p><p>Within psychology, much research has been done into the effects of context reinstatement and factors that influence its effectiveness. Although there is substantial scientific evidence supporting the positive contribution of context reinstatement to the learning process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Smith, 1979)</ref>, there are also studies that attenuate its effectiveness (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fernandez &amp; Alonso, 2001)</ref> or found no effects at all (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hockley, 2008)</ref>. To resolve this, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Smith and Vela (2001)</ref> conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis into the effects of context reinstatement and concluded that context reinstatement indeed stimulates the memory and facilitates the recall of memories. They found an average effect size of d = 28 and qualified this as a modest but reliable effect. Another important conclusion that appears from this meta-analysis is that MCR and PCR are equally effective for the successful recall of memories. This corresponds with findings of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Fernandez and Alonso (2001)</ref> who asked participants to learn words by heart and subsequently tested the extent to which they were able to reproduce them. The testing took place either in the study room in which subjects had studied or in another room (giving them instructions to think about the study area). Their experiment showed that both returning to the room in which subjects had studied (PCR) and the instruction to think back to the learning space <ref type="bibr">(MCR)</ref> resulted in better test results. Both PCR and MCR seem to contribute to the effective retrieval of memories.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context reinstatement and eyewitness statements</head><p>In police investigations, eyewitnesses are usually interviewed about major events they were unexpectedly confronted with, such as a car burglary, shoplifting, or traffic accidents. An accurate recollection is crucial to reconstruct the course of events or find an alleged perpetrator, but is often hampered by the special circumstances under which the memory is stored, such as stress and the presence of distractors. Context reinstatement can help eyewitnesses to remember and recall such events better. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wong and Read (2011)</ref> note that the effect of context reinstatement is stronger under free recall circumstances, such as a spontaneously given statement about an event, than for cued recall, like answering addressed questions, or recognizing a suspect from a line-up. Recognizing (cued recall) is largely based on processes that take place unconsciously, while remembering (free recall) information from the memory is achieved on the basis of a conscious search process. This causes more context information being available that can be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Robinson &amp; Johnson, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr">cf. Emmett, Clifford and Gwyer, 2003)</ref>. This suggests that context reinstatement has most potential when taking a spontaneous statement, and not when targeted questions are asked.</p><p>Regarding the differences between MCR and PCR, studies in this particular area almost exclusively focus on MCR and, in general, most of these studies acknowledge the effectiveness of MCR in helping eye witnesses (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dando, Wilcock &amp; Milne, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Milne &amp; Bull, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hammond, Wagstaff &amp; Cole, 2006)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dando, Wilcock and Milne (2009)</ref> found that MCR resulted in more accurate testimonies, with more (correct) details and less confabulations. However, MCR in the context of eyewitnesses is also associated with detrimental effects. Participants in a study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Memon, Wark, Holley, Bull and Kohnken (1997)</ref> did not only report more correct details after being exposed to MCR, they also reported a higher number of incorrect and confabulated details. Overall, their statements were less accurate compared to the statements of the participants in the control group. Applying MCR therefore entails certain risks. As one of the very few studies focusing on PCR, Orbach, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hershkowitz, Lamb, Sternberg and Horowitz (2000)</ref> pioneered by examining whether visiting the scene of alleged abuse would facilitate the recall of information by alleged victims. They found that the reported number of informative details did not differ between the victims that were interviewed on the crime scene compared to the victims interviewed in the investigators' offices. Another study on the use of PCR in police practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Wong &amp; Read, 2011)</ref> showed positive results.</p><p>Participants who viewed a video of a staged theft and who had subsequently undergone a PCR procedure showed greater willingness to identify someone in a lineup, greater identification accuracy, and better recall of details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The confidence-quality relationship</head><p>Professionals working with eyewitnesses often use the degree of confidence of an eyewitness as an indicator for the quality of that particular statement. Research even shows that this confidence judgement is the most important factor in determining the credibility of the statement . This is perilous, since there is substantial evidence that eyewitness confidence is a bad predictor of the quality of the own statement . A meta-analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sporer, Penrod, Read, and Cutler (1995)</ref> found that the relationship between the confidence of a witness in the quality of his or her statement and the actual quality of the statement is generally weak.</p><p>Investigation of the relationship between the confidence of an eyewitness in the own statement and the actual quality of the statement is known as the metacognitive approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hanczakowski, Zawadzka &amp; Coote, 2014)</ref>. This approach assumes a good quality assessment leads to eyewitnesses being more likely to mention the particular information in an investigative interview. But since there is no (strong) relationship between this quality assessment and the actual quality of a statement, there is a great danger that witnesses may report incorrect information and keep false information, or in the worst case do not even make a statement at all. An improvement in the estimation capacity therefore contributes indirectly to improving the quality of witness statements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hammond, Wagstaff, and Cole (2006)</ref> found that context reinstatement not only has a positive effect on the relationship between the eyewitness' confidence in his statement and the number of correct details in a statement, but also on the number of incorrect details. So, context reinstatement seems to improve self-assessment regarding the amount of correct information, but at the same time resulted in a worse assessment as confidence also increased when the statement contained more incorrect information. Congruently with the latter result, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hanczakowski, Zawadzka, and Coote (2014)</ref> demonstrated that context reinstatement can cause confidence estimates to become weaker predictors of quality (i.e., collateral inflation). A study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wong and Read (2011)</ref> also showed inflated confidence levels as a result of context reinstatement. Specifically, in the PCR condition identification accuracy and confidence judgments proved not to be correlated, as opposed to the control condition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context reinstatement and the confidence-quality relationship</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>This study</head><p>In sum, research into the effects of context reinstatement on the quality of eyewitness statements is scarce and shows divergent results. Most studies acknowledge the effectiveness of context reinstatement (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dando, Wilcock &amp; Milne, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wong &amp; Read, 2011)</ref>, but there are also studies that demonstrate negative (side) effects including more incorrect and non-existing details and lower confidence-quality relationship (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Memon, Wark, Holley, Bull &amp; Kohnken, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hanczakowski, Zawadzka, and Coote, 2014)</ref>. A promising new way to foster context reinstatement and address these concerns is virtual context reinstatement. As the effectiveness of VCR in the domain of eyewitness statements is unknown, in this study VCR will be tested and compared with MCR and PCR. Effectiveness will be measured regarding memorial performance (number of correct, incorrect and confabulated details reported), accuracy, and confidence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD Participants and Design</head><p>Ninety seven participants (38 males / 59 females, mean age = 23, 88 were students from two universities in the east of the Netherlands) took part in this study, which had a one-factor ((PCR vs. MCR vs. VCR vs. control) between-participants design. The dependent variables were participants' memorial performance as measured by the number of correct, incorrect and confabulated details, accuracy (i.e. the number of correct details divided by the total number of details), and confidence. Participants were naïve to the experimental aims.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>In groups of 10 to 12, participants were asked to evaluate a staged crime scene in a police station in the city of Enschede. Among each group of participants were two actors. During the group instructions for the task, one of the actors accidentally pushed the other, who then spilled a cup of water; as a result they got into a (non-physical) fight. After this incident the instructions and the group experiment continued as planned. The total duration of the incident was nine minutes.</p><p>Both the dialogue and the actions (i.e. throwing a plastic cup, screaming and slamming a door) were scripted and followed closely by the actors.</p><p>After a week the participants returned to the police station, assuming to evaluate another staged crime scene. Instead, they were randomly assigned to the experimental context reinstatement conditions and were subsequently asked to give a written statement of their recollection of the incident. All context reinstatement experiences were individual and lasted five minutes. Participants in the MCR condition listened to an audio clip in which they were coached to think back to the incident and the instruction room. In the PCR condition, participants physically returned to the instruction room; they were free to sit or stand wherever they felt their memory was most stimulated. In the VCR condition context reinstatement consisted a virtual representation of the instruction room. After donning VR glasses participants were exposed to 360 o photos of the instruction room. They received a brief technical instruction and were allowed a few moments to get used to the device. They subsequently experienced the virtual representations in which they were instructed to think back to the incident. Participants in de control condition were not provided with any context reinstatement procedure.</p><p>After the context reinstatement manipulations, participants were taken to a neutral room to write down their recollection of the incident in response to both free and cued recall questions. In the free recall phase, participant were asked to write down all they could remember about the incident and subsequently rate their confidence in the accuracy of the statement they had just provided on a six-item scale ranging from 1 (not confident at all) to 7 (very confident).</p><p>In the cued recall phase, participants were asked to give descriptions of the two persons (actors) involved in the incident based on 16 categories (i.e. posture and clothing) and subsequently rate their confidence in the accuracy of their descriptions on a six-item scale ranging from 1 (not confident at all) to 7 (very confident). The Cronbach's alphas of the confidence constructs were respectively .86 (free recall) and .87 (cued recall), which suggests a good reliability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coding</head><p>All statements were coded using a well-tried template technique, developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Memon, Holley, Wark, Bull, and Kohnken (1996)</ref>. First, a comprehensive list of all details that could possibly be mentioned in the statements was compiled, resulting in a list of 353 details. Every detail that was recalled by each participant was classified as either correct, incorrect (e.g. saying the man's shirt was green instead of blue) or confabulation (e.g. mentioning a detail that was not present or did not happen). Details could only be assigned to one category. Vague answers (i.e. "it took a pretty long time") and details that could not be scored objectively (i.e. "he did it because he felt vulnerable") were excluded from the analysis.</p><p>Ten full statements (10%) were randomly selected and scored by two independent judges. Discrepancies between coders were subsequently discussed and resolved, and another ten statements were randomly selected and coded. In the end, this procedure yielded good interrater reliability (Cohen's Kappas .81 and .88, respectively).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context reinstatement and the quality of eyewitness testimonies</head><p>In accordance with other studies in this area (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dando, Wilcock &amp; Milne, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Memon et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Milne &amp; Bull, 2002)</ref>, series of analyses of variance were conducted to assess the extent to which different kinds of context reinstatement influence the quality of eyewitness testimonies. The first series concerns the information given under the condition of free recall (spontaneous statements), the second under cued recall (descriptions).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Free recall (spontaneous statements)</head><p>Univariate analyses of variance revealed a significant effect of Context Reinstatement on the number of confabulated details (F (3,93) = 3.005, p = .034). Post hoc analyses (Tukey) showed that participants in the control condition reported more confabulated details compared to both the VCR (1.04 versus 0.33; p = .058) and the PCR condition (1.04 versus 0.32; p = .048). The control condition did not differ significantly from the MCR condition (1.04 versus 0.50; p = .213). No significant effects on the number of correct details (F (3,93) = 1.225, p = .305), the number of incorrect details (F (3,93) = 0.691, p = .560), or accuracy (F (3,93) = 1.490, p = .222) were found. See table 1 for details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cued recall (descriptions)</head><p>An analysis of variance revealed a marginally significant effect of Context Reinstatement on the number of correctly recalled details (F (3,93) = 2.605, p = .056). Subsequent post hoc analyses (Tukey) showed participants in the VCR condition to list more correct details than those in the PCR condition (25.8 versus 21.8, p = .092) and compared to those in the MCR condition (25.8 versus 21.6, p = . 081). The VCR condition did not differ significantly from the control condition (25.8 versus 22.4; p = .204). The number of incorrect details (F (3,93) = 1.657, p = .182), the number of confabulated details (F (3,93) = .225, p = .879), and accuracy (F (3,93) = 1.130, p = .341) did not show this effect. See table 1 for details. Note: Identical superscripted indexes denote significant contrasts; a p = .048; b p = .058; c p = .081; d p = .092</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confidence</head><p>In total, the confidence that participants had under the circumstances of free recall turned out to be significantly higher than that during cued recall (M = 5.23 versus M = 3.71, t (96) = 18.12, p &lt; .01). Subsequent ANOVAs revealed, however, that neither of these confidence ratings differed depending on context reinstatement (see table 2). Note: Identical superscripted indexes denote significant contrasts; a p &lt; .01</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The confidence-quality relationship</head><p>To assess the confidence-quality relationship, correlations were calculated between participants' confidence on the one hand, and quality (measured by the number of correct, incorrect and confabulated details and accuracy) on the other hand. This was done both for free recall and cued recall. As shown in table 3, the higher participants rated their confidence, the higher was the number of correct details, both for free recall (Pearson r = .211, p = .038) as well for cued recall (Pearson r = .263, p = .010). There were no significant correlations between confidence and the number of incorrect details, confabulated details, and accuracy. Note: * p = .038; ** p = .010</p><p>The next step was to assess this confidence-accuracy relationship for each of the context reinstatement conditions under both free and cued recall conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Free recall (spontaneous statements)</head><p>As can be seen in table 4, during free recall, most correlations between confidence and the dependent measures failed to reach significance regardless of the context reinstatement conditions. However, in the VCR condition, statement confidence proved to be significantly correlated with the number of correctly recalled details (r = .508, p = .01). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cued recall (descriptions)</head><p>As can be seen in table 5, during cued recall, no correlations between confidence and the dependent measures were found in the PCR condition. In the VCR condition, however, a significant correlation with the number of correctly recalled details was found (r = .488, p = .015) and a marginally significant correlation with accuracy (r = .389, p = .060). The MCR condition yielded a negative (but marginally significant) correlation between confidence and the number of confabulated details (r = -.396, p =0.056), indicating that higher confidence corresponded with fewer confabulated details. The control condition, finally, resulted in three (marginally) significant correlations, between confidence and the number of correct details (r = .363, p = .082), incorrect details (r = .529, p = .008), and accuracy (r = -.373, p = .073),</p><p>indicating that higher confidence tended to correspond with more correct and incorrect details, and lower accuracy. Note: a p = .015; b p = .060; c p = .056; d p = .082; e p = .008; f p = .073</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of results</head><p>Previous research has suggested that context reinstatement enhances the quality of eyewitness testimonies. The current study extends this research by incorporating VR as a potentially useful, novel way of context reinstatement. The results presented here suggest that the quality of testimonies is positively affected especially by physical and virtual context reinstatement, i.e. by reinstating contextual information by taking eyewitnesses back to the actual location, or having them experience a rendition of this location in Virtual Reality. Under free recall conditions, eyewitnesses reported a more correct picture of what they had experienced some time before, as evidenced by fewer confabulated details. No effects were found on the number of correctly and incorrectly recalled details. Under circumstances of cued recall there was a marginally significant trend visible in the number of correctly recalled details; people in the virtual context reinstatement condition tended to perform slightly better than those in the physical and mental reinstatement groups. Based on these results, one could cautiously conclude that virtual and physical context reinstatement produce similar results; both perform slightly better compared to mental reinstatement and no context reinstatement. In addition, free recall procedures in obtaining eyewitness testimonies are, more than cued recall, amenable to context reinstatement.</p><p>Furthermore, the current study set out to explore the correspondence between the certainty people have about the accuracy of their recollections and actual quality depending on the manner context was reinstated. It turned out that context reinstatement in and of itself yielded better results than when no reinstatement was executed: participants who did not undergo any form of context reinstatement did also not show a relationship between statement confidence and quality. Moreover, especially virtual context reinstatement led to rather strong relationships of confidence with the number of correctly recalled details, both with free and cued recall. With the latter, confidence also proved to correlate substantially with accuracy. The remaining two methods of context reinstatement, mental and physical, did not show these results. Apparently, in the case of virtual context reinstatement an eyewitness' confidence judgement and the quality of his or her statement are better calibrated than in case of other forms of reinstatement. Mental context reinstatement resulted in an inverse relationship between confidence and confabulated details, but this was only the case under the circumstance of cued recall. Physical context reinstatement proved not to result in any relationships between confidence and statement quality, and, hence, can be concluded to contribute the least.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The current research suggests that virtual as well as physical context reinstatement may reduce the tendency among eyewitnesses to confabulate details. This is in line with research underscoring the positive effect of context reinstatement on eyewitnesses' memory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dando, Wilcock &amp; Milne, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hammond, Wagstaff &amp; Cole, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Herskowitz et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Krafka &amp; Penrod, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Milne &amp; Bull, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Smith &amp; Vela, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wong &amp; Read, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Others, however, have suggested that context reinstatement actually causes mistakes in memory recollection and the inventing of details <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Van Amelsvoort, Rispens &amp; Grolman, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Memon et al., 1996)</ref>. These adverse effects of context reinstatement, however, did not occur in this study. In fact, it appears that the risk of confabulated information is higher when no context reinstatement is employed.</p><p>What is striking about these results is the often incorrect and sometimes even confabulated information reported about the incident that participants were witness to. It happened for instance that people completely missed the mark when they attempted to describe the actors. This is all the more surprising in light of the near-perfect circumstances under which the study took place. As opposed to this study, in real life detectives and police officers have to deal with time pressure, stress, presence of other people, some of whom may have got something to do with the crime or incident, and longer intervals between the incident and eyewitness interview, all of which likely influence the quality of recalled information (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Valentine &amp; Mesout, 2009</ref>, for a link between stress and witness performance). The question that arises is how the results of the current study hold up under circumstances that resemble actual working conditions more closely. While it may be true that overall performance levels drop as a result of, for instance, stress or increased retention intervals, the extent to which such factors would affect the differential effects reported here, i.e. the differences between the conditions, is an important question that begs additional research.</p><p>In addition, the current research suggests that context reinstatement may calibrate confidence in the statement or description given. Previous research has failed to create a clear image of the relationship between context reinstatement and assessment capability. Some have shown that context reinstatement negatively affects witnesses' ability to judge their recollection from memory (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hanczakowski, Zawadzka &amp; Coote, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wong &amp; Read, 2009)</ref>, whereas other studies suggest the exact opposite (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Krafka &amp; Penrod, 1985)</ref>. Our results are in conformance with the latter, and at the same time add onto these by offering insight into which means of context reinstatements is most beneficial for witnesses to provide an adequate assessment of the quality of their statements or descriptions. In this respect, virtual context reinstatement has emerged as best option, and, to a somewhat lesser extent, mental reinstatement. Physical context reinstatement could not be shown to influence the relationship between confidence and memory recall, while omission of context reinstatement produced some adverse effects; here confidence was negatively related to accuracy and positively with incorrect recollection of information.</p><p>The improvement of the match between confidence and quality is an important factor in the process of obtaining eyewitness statements. First, detectives and police officers tend to rely on eyewitnesses' expressed confidence to assess the quality of the testimony they have obtained . In light of his, a well-calibrated confidence on the part of a witness may be instrumental in successful case research. Secondly, a witness' confidence influences his or her preparedness to give a statement in the first place. Witnesses appear to be more willing to divulge their recollections if they are confident that these are actually correct <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hanczakowski, Zawadzka &amp; Coote, 2014)</ref>. Clearly, if context reinstatement procedures cause witnesses to be confident when their memory of past events is correct, this may well lead to an increased willingness to share their information. In sum, a better match between confidence and statement quality indirectly increases the quality of police and detective work. The study described here suggests that virtual context reinstatement is the best candidate to do so.</p><p>One of very few studies to actually compare the use of different kinds of context reinstatement in a forensic-interview setting is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hershkowitz, Orbach, Lamb, Sternberg and Horowitz (2002)</ref>. They found little differences in effectiveness between mental and physical context reinstatement. The current study aligns with <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hershkowitz' et al. (2002)</ref> findings; here, too, mental and physical reinstatement produce largely similar results. In addition, however, our results suggest that the effectiveness of mental and physical context reinstatement are actually surpassed by that of virtual context reinstatement. We consider this to be a remarkable result, as one could reasonably argue that physically returning to the scene of a crime or accident would yield the most context-rich information, and would therefore result in the most complete recollection. One possible explanation could be that physically returning to a scene of a crime or incident yields stress, and that this negatively affects the quality of recollection. Indeed, small amounts of stress have been shown to hamper the retrieval of information from memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Boon, Odinot, Horselenberg &amp; Geijsen, 2016)</ref>. By making use of a virtual representation of the same location and offering witnesses a safe place to tell their story, this stress could be prevented or minimized, while maintaining the memory-aiding capacity of the physical location.</p><p>Remarkably, many of the studies that have managed to show effects of context reinstatement happen to be controlled laboratory studies, which make use of mock witnesses or participants who are exposed to video recordings of the focal incident (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Dando, Wilcock &amp; Milne, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hammond, Wagstaff &amp; Cole, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Milne &amp; Bull, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wong &amp; Read, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Studies in more realistic settings often fail to establish these effects, or show these to a lesser extent <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hershkowitz et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Orbach, Hershkowitz, Lamb, Sternberg &amp; Horowitz, 2000)</ref>, suggesting that realistic situations introduce interfering outside influences, dampening the potential effects of context reinstatement. The current study was an attempt to create as realistic a situation as possible, while maintaining a high degree of control. Hence, it was designed to take place at an actual police station, the incident occurred real-time and under the very noses of the participants rather than on-screen, and the interview was conducted as it would in an actual police investigation. At the same time, tight experimental control required us, for instance, to script the incident and hire professional actors to enact them, and maintain a fixed one-week retention interval for all participants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>In conclusion</head><p>In addition to comparing the effectiveness of conventional means of context reinstatement, this study introduced a relatively new form: virtual context reinstatement. Surprisingly, this new form appeared to outperform the conventional ones: it was associated with fewer invented details, more correct information, and witnesses' confidence that was more in tune with testimony quality. More research is needed, however, to assess whether these promising results can be consolidated, to uncover the psychological mechanisms responsible for these positive effects, and to assess the influence of potentially interfering situational factors such as stress and retention intervals.</p><p>Much work needs to be done to assess the usefulness of virtual context reinstatement in forensic context. This conclusion is amplified by the fact that virtually exposing eyewitnesses or suspects to the scene of a crime or incident appears rather easy to implement into police practice. Physical reinstatement may not always be possible, desirable, or convenient, for instance, if the crime scene is still holds forensic evidence (which may become contaminated or destroyed), the crime scene changed due to weather conditions or a visit to the crime scene requires extensive traffic regulation; virtual context reinstatement, however, may overcome such obstacles. Provided that the hardware and software as well as the appropriate skills are available, it may significantly add to the quality of police investigations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>The effect of context reinstatement on free and cued recall of the incident</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>PCR</cell><cell>VCR</cell><cell>MCR</cell><cell>Control</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell>M (SD)</cell><cell>M (SD)</cell><cell>M (SD)</cell><cell>M (SD)</cell></row><row><cell>Free recall</cell><cell>Correct</cell><cell>35.64 (12.31)</cell><cell>42.42 (13.19)</cell><cell>38.75 (11.16)</cell><cell>38.71 (12.79)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Incorrect</cell><cell>2.12 (1.97)</cell><cell>2.29 (1.37)</cell><cell>2.71 (1.76)</cell><cell>2.75 (2.19)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Confabulated</cell><cell>0.32 (0.69) a</cell><cell>0.33 (0.64) b</cell><cell>0.50 (0.83)</cell><cell>1.04 (1.46) ab</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Accuracy</cell><cell>93.52 (5.60)</cell><cell>93.77 (4.22)</cell><cell>92.05 (5.73)</cell><cell>90.92 (5.78)</cell></row><row><cell cols="2">Cued recall Correct</cell><cell>21.76 (5.47) d</cell><cell>25.75 (6.73) cd</cell><cell>21.63 (5.45) c</cell><cell>22.38 (6.06)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Incorrect</cell><cell>9.16 (4.10)</cell><cell>7.38 (3.67)</cell><cell>7.00 (3.14)</cell><cell>7.50 (3.81)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Confabulated</cell><cell>1.20 (1.76)</cell><cell>1.46 (1.35)</cell><cell>1.21 (1.56)</cell><cell>1.50 (1.91)</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>Accuracy</cell><cell>68.71 (13.09)</cell><cell>73.97 (10.54)</cell><cell>72.99 (9.56)</cell><cell>72.68 (9.64)</cell></row></table><note></note></figure>
