			<abstract>
				<p>According to the normative standpoint, decision-making under risk, as it is traditionally instantiated in choice among fully described probabilistic lotteries, should not be affected by the disclosure of outcomes (feedback). Yet, contrary to this normative prescription, empirical studies have repeatedly reported that risk preferences are affected by immediate presentation of choice outcomes. The consensual and intuitive hypothesis is that feedback affects risk preferences via a learning process, whereby experienced outcomes alter the representation of subjective values. However, despite a relatively large body of published studies, available evidence does not allow robustly establishing the direction and the impact of feedback on key decision variables, namely risk propensity and expected value maximization, limiting our ability to establish a clear cognitive mechanism. Here, we ran seven behavioral experiments, tailored to address this gap and found that the presence of feedback consistently increases risktaking, without any detectable impact on expected value maximization. Crucially, fine-grained analyses of the temporal dynamics of the effect of feedback directly falsified one of the currently most influential models of the role of experience in decisions under risk, and challenges any instantiation of the learning hypotheses. These results rather favor of an attitudinal effect, induced by the anticipation of feedback information. Epistemic curiosity and regret avoidance may drive this effect in partial and complete feedback conditions, respectively.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Traditionally, empirical investigations of decision-making under risk have mostly been carried out in behavioral setups limited to one-shot description-based choice problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> : unique binary choices between mutually exclusive probabilistic options (lotteries), where relevant information (i.e., prospective outcomes and probabilities) is explicitly displayed, and considered known to the decision maker. This experimental setup matches the scope and limits of both normative and descriptive decision theories, which are generally silent about the effects of feedback and choice repetition <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> . Arguably, although both theoretically and empirically convenient, this one-shot description-based framework is not representative of the vast majority of decision situations that one faces every day. Most decision problems are recurrent, and, very often, one gets to know the outcome of one's choice (partial feedback) -and sometimes also the outcome of the forgone option (complete feedback) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> . To address those shortcomings, repetitions and feedback have been gradually incorporated into the study of human decisionmaking under risk over the last couple of decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> . This experimental innovation revealed that, in contrast to the normative dictate, human choices and risk preferences elicited in repeated decisions under risk do appear to change depending on the presence versus absence of feedback.</p><p>A widespread and intuitive hypothesis concerning the effect of feedback on risk preferences proposes that outcome information modifies the decision-maker's subjective representation of probabilities. Indeed, from studies involving one-shot decisions, it appears clearly that individuals behave as if their subjective representation of probabilities is distorted (overweighting of rare events, underweighting of common events <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14 )</ref>. In the presence of feedback, the realized frequency of the outcomes received in the context of repeated decisions can be used to update (if not correct) the subjective beliefs concerning their probabilities, ultimately affecting one's preferences and choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . We shall refer to this category of accounts as the learning hypothesis. Because the integration of feedback in future choices is supposed to correct originally distorted subjective probabilities, the learning hypothesis often assumes that the presence of feedback should correct representational biases and, as a consequence, promote optimal (i.e., expected value maximizing) choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . Admittedly, though, these simple predictions from the learning hypothesis can be challenged, e.g., by the presence of learning biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , or when the probabilities of the outcomes are extreme and the options are not sufficiently sampled: two conditions that lead the experienced and the actual frequency of the outcomes to diverge <ref type="bibr">20 . 4</ref> The notion that feedback should enhance optimal decision-making goes beyond academic circles and has been widely proposed as a strategy to debias individuals and improve their decisions in significant applied contexts, such as finance and healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> . Feedback is, in fact, a fundamental element of "boosting"-an approach distinct from "nudging"-which aims to create a more enduring positive impact on decision-making performance by incorporating a learning component <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> .</p><p>A relatively recent instantiation of the learning hypothesis is embedded in the BEAST model (Best Estimate And Sampling Tool), which becomes particularly influential after emerging victorious from a choice prediction competition, notably featuring choices between fully described lotteries followed by complete feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . The model, routed in the decisionby-sampling tradition <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , postulates that as soon as feedback is available, the subjective estimations of decision variables (outcomes are probabilities) are based on samples drawn from the past experienced outcomes. The BEAST is currently considered the reference against which new (and old) models of decision-making under risk should be compared, as testified by numerous follow-up studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> .</p><p>An alternative category of accounts, which we shall refer to as the attitudinal hypothesis, conjectures that the mere presence of feedback changes the decision-maker's preferences, independently from any learning process. We identify in the literature two main candidate cognitive processes for the attitudinal hypothesis: epistemic curiosity and regret.</p><p>Epistemic curiosity pertains to the idea of gaining utility from the resolution of uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> . Indeed, when feedback is available, some options acquire different informational values with respect to the resolution of uncertainty. For instance, when only the outcome of the chosen option is revealed (partial feedback) and the decision features a riskier (high variance) versus a safer (low variance) lottery, choosing the safer lottery resolves less uncertainty about the final state of the world. In other words, there is an extra informational incentive to choose the riskier option, if partial feedback is provided. This informational asymmetry explains how curiosity −or an uncertainty minimization drive − may shift choices in favor of the risky options if the participant anticipates that the decision will be followed by feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</p><p>Regret can also cause attitudinal effects of feedback when it is expressed as an anticipated emotion, during decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . The rationale is that, when considering choosing a safe lottery over a risky one, one might forecast the regret elicited by observing a positive resolution from the best alternative outcome (the unchosen, riskier lottery) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> , and therefore make more risk-seeking choices to avert this possibility. As opposed to epistemic curiosity, anticipated regret should notably emerge when the outcome of the unchosen option is also available (complete feedback). In support of the prominent role of counterfactual emotions in decisionmaking, regret has recently been invoked to explain certain aspects of choices elicited in paradigms that couple descriptions with feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .</p><p>Critically, in contrast to the learning hypothesis, which supposes that the effect of the feedback should emerge gradually, the attitudinal hypothesis conceives that it can emerge even before any feedback is experienced -i.e. by anticipation. Because the two hypotheses differ in the temporal relation with respect to the time of choice and outcomes, fine-grained temporal dynamics can dissociate the two accounts: attitudinal effects precede choices while learning effects follow outcomes. In addition, the two hypotheses are also different in their relation to choice optimality. Learning mechanisms are generally supposed to correct representational biases and, accordingly, should increase expected value maximization. Attitudinal ones are more silent in that respect.</p><p>The goal of the present study is to evaluate the relative merit of these alternative hypotheses in seven newly conducted experiments (N=538) and a reanalysis of a previous dataset (N=446).</p><p>The new experiments have been designed to systematically investigate the role of feedback in decision-making under risk across different experimental manipulations that allow discriminating competing accounts. Our findings consistently challenge the learning hypothesis in favor of attitudinal mechanisms, while suggesting that both curiosity and regret play a role under different feedback information regimens and provide compelling empirical evidence against the otherwise very influential BEAST model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p>To address our research questions, we ran a series of seven incentivized experiments (six online -N=100 for each experiment before the application of strict exclusion criteria -and one in the laboratory -N=30; see Methods). The six online experiments were variants of the experimental paradigm that we will describe below.</p></div>

(A) Typical screens</head><p>of our behavioral tasks (including the beginning of a block and a typical trial). For each variant (with or without block instructions; partial or complete feedback information) we specify in which experiment has been implemented. (B) Decision problems in Experiments 1-6. Top panel: specification of the risky options. The Y and the X axes present in bold the decision variables (non-zero magnitude and probability, respectively) of the risky option -which always has the form (pts, prob; 0, 1-prob), while the numbers contained in the cell of the matrix (in gray italics) represent the Expected Value of the risky option. Bottom panel: specification of the sure/safe options.</p><p>In Exp1-4, we have a sure lottery and in Exp5-6 we have a 50/50 safe lottery. Magnitudes depend on three independent factors of the design (pts and prob of the risky option and whether the risky or the sure/safe option has a higher EV). (C) R-Rate (risky-choice rate) and O-rate (optimal-choice rate, namely Expected Value maximizing rates) as a function of the presence or absence of feedback (F and nF, respectively) across the seven experiments.

(D) The effect of feedback on R-rates (namely, the difference of R-rates between Feedback and no-Feedback conditions) as a function of which option (risky or sure/safe) has higher EV across experiments 1-6 (as explained above, Exp 7 is not eligible for this analysis either). *p&lt;0.05, ***p&lt;0.001, ns = not significant, with respect to two-tailed Wilcoxon Signedrank test.</p><p>Our experimental design allowed us to overcome several methodological shortcomings identified in previous literature, which overall delivered an unclear picture concerning the directionality of the effect of feedback in decision-making under risk (Supplementary Materials/Literature Review for a quantitative survey of the literature). One novelty of our experimental design is using a factorial design with a within-subjects manipulation of postchoice feedback (present or absent); feedback was treated as a between-subjects factor in most of the previous studies, with only one exception 27 -our design improves over <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Erev et al., (2017)</ref> by equalizing the number of repetitions for the two conditions (their design featured five repetitions for no-feedback and twenty for feedback) and by counterbalancing the order of the conditions. Furthermore, unlike most of the previous experiments, we included the same number of trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> in both feedback conditions, to disentangle between the effect of mere repetition and the effect of feedback itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . Trials featuring the same decision problem were clustered in blocks of 10 trials. Feedback and no-feedback blocks were randomly interspersed ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>).</p><p>We used a binary choice task featuring a sure and a risky option in each trial. The risky option had the form of (m, p; 0, 1-p), namely giving m points with probability p and zero points otherwise. In addition to feedback (present or absent), we also factorially manipulated the choice optimality, i.e., whether the risky or the sure option has a higher expected value (EV): in one condition, the risky option maximizes the EV; in the other condition, the sure option maximizes EV ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B)</ref>. This allowed us to orthogonalize risk preference and decision optimality -two features that have often been confounded in the literature. Finally, we manipulated within-subjects the probability of (positive) gain associated with the risky option (three levels, namely 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9), and the magnitude of the risky option (two levels, 40 and 60 points), thus leading to a decision space of 12 unique decision problems. Together with our feedback/no feedback manipulation and the repetitions (×10 per decision context), our final factorial design comprised 240 choices per subject, which is larger than that commonly found in the literature.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The role of feedback and instructions on risk preferences</head><p>The first experiment (Exp.1) featured partial feedback i.e., we revealed only the outcome associated with the chosen option. Participants were not informed about the presence or absence of the feedback before starting a given block. Dependent variables, i.e., the propensity to choose the risky option (R-rate) or the optimal -EV maximizing -option (O-rate) were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed effect (GLME) model with the task factors (presence of feedback and option optimality) as independent variables (see Methods for more details).</p><p>Our analyses of the R-rate identified a significant main effect of feedback (logistic regression βFEEDBACK1 &gt; 0, P = e-07, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, choiceRisky, Exp1(1)), which was characterized by an increased propensity to choose the risky option when trial-by-trial feedback was present <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 2A; Figure 1C</ref>, Exp1). Interestingly, this increase was of the same size and direction both when the risky option was better and when the sure option was better (with respect to EV) ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1D, Exp1)</ref>, such that there was no detectable main effect of feedback on the optimal choice rate (logistic regression P = 0.78, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, choiceOptimal, Exp1(1); Figure 1C, Exp1; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2B</ref>). In other terms, there was a significant interaction between feedback and option optimality: feedback decreased the O-rate when the sure option was the EV-maximizing one but increased it otherwise (logistic regression βFEEDBACK1 &lt; 0, P = e-10, βFEEDBACK1:RISKYBETTER1 + βFEEDBACK1 &gt; 0, Pinteraction = e-56, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, choiceOptimal, Exp1(2)). Finally, we examined the trial-by-trial unfolding of the main effect of feedback on R-rates. The learning hypothesis predicts that the effect of feedback should be absent at the first trial, then gradually emerge and increase after the repeated experience with feedback. Our analyses revealed a slightly different pattern: while indeed no significant effect of feedback could be detected in the first trial R-rate in feedback and no-feedback conditions abruptly diverged in the second trial and the difference remained constant until the end of the block (P = .12 for Trial1, P &lt; 0.01 for Trial2-10 Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted values of two-tailed WSRTs; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure    2C</ref>).</p><p>Overall, the results of this first experiment appeared, at the macroscopic level, in line with most of the existent literature generally showing an increase of R-rate in the presence of feedback.</p><p>At a finer grain level, because the effects develop after the first feedback, they seem overall consistent with a learning effect. The fact that the effect is abrupt rather than gradual could be understood as one-shot learning. However, because participants in Exp.1 started each block without knowing whether they would receive feedback or not, the first trial also implicitly but unambiguously informed them about the presence of feedback in the ongoing block (feedback or no-feedback), which may have altered their attitude toward risky options. Thus, although the separation of R-rates in the second trial can be a result of (one-shot) learning, it can also reflect the triggering of an attitudinal change. Of note, also against the learning hypothesis is the fact that the presence of feedback did not improve the optimal choice rate.</p><p>To disentangle these two possibilities, we ran a second experiment (Exp.2) in which, at the beginning of each block, participants received explicit instructions (hence block instructions) mentioning whether they would receive post-choice feedback in the upcoming block or not.   <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). Yet, the between-experiment manipulation of the block instruction produced a significant difference in the effect of feedback on first-trial R-rates (P = .0022; two-sample two-tailed t-test; inset of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2F)</ref>. Actually, the difference in R-rates between feedback and no-feedback blocks in Exp.2 arose from the very first trial -and remained significant for the rest of the block (P &lt; 0.01 for Trial1-10 BH-adjusted values of two-tailed WSRTs; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2F</ref>). Thus, it seems that the mere anticipation of feedback information induced by the block instructions was enough to change risk preference before any feedback was actually experienced.</p><p>In summary, results from Exp.1 and Exp.2 clearly revealed that the presence of feedback about the outcome of the chosen lottery increased risk propensity but not choice optimality. Besides, while Exp.1's results only superficially supported the learning hypothesis, the results following the introduction of explicit block instructions in Exp.2 favor the attitudinal hypothesis. Exp.1 and Exp.2 featured a partial feedback regimen and since the result of the sure option is always known by definition and the result of the unchosen option is not disclosed, choosing the risky option provides the participant with more information about the current state of the world. Thus, this pattern of results is consistent with an attitudinal effect created by epistemic curiosity, where the demand for uncertainty resolution increases risk propensity because of the informational asymmetry between the risky and sure lotteries. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Curiosity cannot be the only determinant of the effect of feedback on risk preference: a role for regret</head><p>If epistemic curiosity is the only driver of the observed effect, the informational asymmetry between the sure option (whose result can be inferred with certainty in absence of feedback) and the risky one (whose result cannot be inferred with certainty in absence of feedback) causes the increased risk-taking propensity in the presence of feedback. Thus, according to the epistemic curiosity account, the effect should vanish (or, at least, decrease) under a complete (or 'full') feedback regimen, i.e., when the forgone outcome of the unchosen option is additionally revealed. To test this hypothesis, we ran Exp.3 and Exp.4, which were analogous to Exp. 1 (without block instructions) and Exp.2 (with block instructions) except for the fact that they both featured complete feedback.</p><p>The complete-feedback experiments replicated the main effects observed in their partial feedback counterparts (Exp.1 and Exp.2). Most importantly, the presence of complete feedback still increased the R-rate and had no effect on the O-rate ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1C</ref>, Exp.3 and Exp.4; <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table    1</ref>).</p><p>The pattern of results at the level of the trial-by-trial dynamic was also replicated. In Exp.3</p><p>(without block instructions), the divergence induced by the presence versus absence of feedback was detectable from the third trial and remains significant for the rest of the block (P = 0.10 for Trial1, P = 0.21 for Trial2, P &lt; 0.01 for Trial3-10 BH-adjusted values of two-tailed WSRTs; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3A</ref>). In Exp.4 (the one with block instructions), contrary to the idea of epistemic curiosity being the sole determinant of the change in risk propensity between feedback and no feedback conditions, we found an effect from the first trial. The R-rates in the feedback blocks are significantly higher than the no-feedback ones starting from the first trial and throughout the block (P &lt; 0.01 for Trial1-10 BH-adjusted values of two-tailed WSRTs; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3Β</ref>). As in Exp.1 versus Exp.2, the between-experiment manipulation of the block instructions produced a significant difference in the effect of feedback on first-trial R-rates in Exp.3 versus Exp.4 (P = .0025; two-sample two-tailed t-test; inset of <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3Β</ref>).</p><p>While these results are once again consistent with a feedback-induced attitudinal change in risk preference (the effect arose before any feedback was received), they are not easily accommodated by the epistemic curiosity account, because, under the complete feedback regimen, there is no uncertainty resolution utility bonus attributable to choosing the risky option. An alternative psychological mechanism for this effect that is compatible with the complete feedback scenario is the anticipated regret. To understand why anticipated regret could represent a possible explanation for this effect, it should be first noted that in many economic decision-making settings, regret is generally thought to be dependent on a comparison between the obtained and the forgone outcome and that this comparison is made explicit only in the complete feedback condition, where regret is experienced whenever the forgone outcome is higher than the obtained one. We propose that at the decision stage, the option that gives the best outcome most of the time gets the regret "premium". This premium is further modulated by the ratio between the more frequent best outcome (by comparison to the alternative) and the range of the possible outcomes (i.e., the difference between the best and worst possible outcomes) in the decision problem. Hence, the regret premium of an option depends both on the probability that the option delivers an outcome greater than the alternative and on its magnitude relative to the outcome range.</p><p>Note that according to this definition, in our design, the options with the greater regret premium are those associated with a high (90%) probability of delivering the risky outcome because: 1) they deliver the best possible outcome compared to the alternative 9 times out of 10, and 2) since the risky outcome is the largest in a decision pair, its value relative to the range of available outcomes is high (r~=1). Conversely, in decision problems where the probability of delivering the risky option is low (10%), the option that delivers the best outcome most of the time is the safe one. However, its regret premium is drastically reduced because the value of the safe outcome is generally much smaller than the range of the available outcomes (&lt;&lt;1).</p><p>Thus, to assess the anticipated regret hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of feedback as a function of the probability of the best-risky outcome (10%, 50% and 90%) and of the type of feedback (partial and complete). This analysis revealed a clear interaction (linear regression on the differences of individual average R-rates between F and nF conditions βpRISKY:TypeOfFeedback &gt; 0 P = 0.0011; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3E</ref>), which was driven by the effect of feedback increasing as a function of the probability of the best-risky outcome in the complete feedback experiments (logistic regression <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, choiceRisky: PFEEDBACK1 = 0.86, βFEEDBACK1:P_RISKY1 &gt; 0, P = e-04, βFEEDBACK1:P_RISKY2 &gt; 0, P = e-11, Exp3(2); PFEEDBACK1 = 0.31 βFEEDBACK1:P_RISKY1 &gt; 0, P = e-15, βFEEDBACK1:P_RISKY2 &gt; 0, P = e-19, Exp4(2)) but being stable in the partial feedback experiments (βFEEDBACK1 &gt; 0, P = e-04, PFEEDBACK1:P_RISKY1 = 0.14, βFEEDBACK1:P_RISKY2 &gt; 0, P = 0.013 Exp1(2); βFEEDBACK1 &gt; 0, P = e-11, PFEEDBACK1:P_RISKY1 = 0.24, PFEEDBACK1:P_RISKY2 = 0.065, Exp2(2)). Note, that since the regret "premium" is also proportional to the relative magnitude of the best outcome of the regret-minimizing option and given that the magnitude of the sure option is very small when we are in the low-probability case (because the sure option's magnitude is close to the Expected Value of the risky option (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1B)</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Extending the results to moderate risk options and losses</head><p>Next, we attempted to further clarify the psychological mechanisms involved in this effect. The fact that, in all experiments, the sure option is systematically a certain prospect leaves open the possibility that the effect of feedback is idiosyncratic to this framing. Indeed, certainty effects are known to heavily weigh decisions and to create robust paradoxes <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> . In the next two experiments, we therefore assessed the robustness of our results to variation in outcome probabilities, specifically in contexts where the non-risky option is not certain. To do so, we designed Exp.5 and Exp. 6, where we substituted the sure option (which gives a specific amount with certainty) with a 50%-50% low variance lottery with EV equal to the one of the sure option ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1B)</ref>. This new option remains relatively safe (given its low variance), yet now features an uncertain outcome. We shall refer to this option as the safe option, to differentiate it from both the sure and the risky. All other things considered (i.e., except for the sure options being substituted with the corresponding safe ones), Exp.5 and Exp.6 were respectively indistinguishable from Exp.2 (partial feedback) and Exp.4 (complete feedback) ( <ref type="figure">Figure 1A)</ref>.</p><p>Consolidating our conclusions, all the main results identified in Exp.1-4 were replicated in this modified setup ( <ref type="figure">Figure S1)</ref>. Notably, the presence of feedback increased risk-taking from the first trial significantly in the partial feedback Exp. 5 and numerically in the complete feedback  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">&amp; 4E)</ref>. Finally, if anything when pooling all the experiments, contrary to the expectations of the learning hypothesis, we found a small negative impact (~1%) of the presence of feedback on the optimal choice rate ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1)</ref>.</p><p>Bayesian evidence suggest a strong to very strong (depending on the scale used -e.g. Jeffreys or Kass and Raftery <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> ) support in favor of the null hypothesis of O-rate not being increased by feedback against the alternative hypothesis that feedback increases O-rates (BF10 = 0.015 with uninformed Cauchy prior with scale 0.707; BF10 = 0.017 with informed Normal prior with mean and std calculated by the empirical data of Erev_2017).</p><p>Finally, in a last experiment performed in the lab, we also showed that our main findings hold when incentives are increased and monetary losses are introduced (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1C</ref>, Exp7 and Supplementary Materials/Loss Experiment). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trial-by-trial analysis</head><p>A follow-up question is whether the abrupt emergence of the feedback effect on the second trial in the experiments without block instructions was dependent on the choice made on the first trial. We observe that the main effect of feedback is observed regardless of the previous choice type (sure/safe, versus risky), and additively to the main effect of the previous choice type on R-rates ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5A and 5C)</ref>. Since the second-trial effect is present regardless of the choice made on the first trial, only the mere discovery of the presence of feedback (and consequent attitudinal change) could explain the effect, challenging the learning hypothesis.</p><p>The existence of feedback-induced attitudinal effects on risk preferences does not rule exclude that additional feedback-induced learning processes co-exist. However, feedback-induced learning processes may not be apparent when looking at the average risky choice rate, because their effect depends on the previous trial choice and outcome. To investigate possible learning effects in trial-by-trial dynamics, we analyzed the probability of repeating a risky choice as a function of the outcome received in the previous trial. The logic of this analysis is that virtually any instantiation of a learning process would induce a "positive recency" effect, meaning that the probability of repeating a risky choice should increase after receiving the best possible (nonzero) outcome, compared to receiving the worst possible (zero) outcome <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">(Figure 5E, left)</ref>. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing this behavioral variable (probability of repeating a risky choice, p(Rt|Rt-1)) in the feedback condition across all datasets. The results are in sharp contrast with the predictions of learning hypothesis ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5F)</ref>. In fact, the probability of repeating a risky choice was lower after receiving positive feedback (logistic regressions βRISKY(t-1)&gt;0 &lt; 0, P = .012 for Exp5 and P &lt; .001 for the all the rest, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, repeatRisky, Exp1-6(1); means p(Rt|Rt-1=0) ± std = 0.69±0.27, p(Rt|Rt-1&gt;0) ± std = 0.62±0.26, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, two-tailed P = e-05). The analysis of trial-by-trial dynamics thus shows no support for any form of feedback-induced learning process, and rather strictly falsifies it. The observed behavioral pattern exhibits in fact negative recency, which is better understood as a manifestation of the gambler's fallacy (in the laboratory <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> and in an ecological (real-life) setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> ), according to which participants would move away from a recently rewarded risky choice because they (wrongly) assume that the subsequent likelihood of positive feedback will be lower ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5F</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5G</ref>). This gambler's fallacy interpretation is further confirmed by conditioning this analysis on the probability of the risky outcome (recall, in our task we featured three probability levels: 0.1, 0.5 and 0.9). This actually reveals that the effect is modulated by the underlying outcome probability and is maximal when outcomes are rare (p=0.1: subjects perceive the likelihood of receiving two positive outcomes in a row lower than reality) and absent when the outcomes are common (p=0.9) (logistic regressions βRISKY(t-1)&gt;0 :P_RISKY2 &gt; 0, P = .007 for Exp3 and P &lt; .001 for all the rest, <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>, repeatRisky, Exp1-6(2); <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5G</ref>).</p><p>Next, we wanted to check whether the abrupt effect of feedback between the first and the second trial in experiments without block instructions was influenced by the outcome received on the first trial. While confirming the presence of a negative recency effect, the results also show that the effect of feedback is detectable, regardless of the nature of the outcome received on the first trial ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 5B and 5D)</ref>. This result further supports the idea of an outcome-independent attitudinal change in risk preferences.</p><p>To sum up, not only do we demonstrate that the effect of feedback on risk preference precedes the reception of any feedback (and is, therefore, better understood as a change in attitude), but we also disprove any residual role for feedback-induced learning processes in the trial-by-trial dynamics by evidencing biased reactions to probabilistic and stochastic events akin to the gambler's fallacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Confirming our findings in a previous dataset</head><p>We started our investigation by noting some discrepancies in the literature concerning the directionality of the effect of feedback in decision-making under risk, which was generally understood as stemming from a learning process <ref type="table">(Table S2 &amp;</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3)</ref>. Over 7 Experiments we found that the presence of feedback increases the propensity of taking risks, with no detectable consequence on the optimal choice rate. By manipulating block-wise instructions (present vs absence) we also found that the effects were mediated by a change of attitude of a different nature in the partial (consistent with curiosity) and complete (consistent with regret) feedback condition; trial-by-trial dynamics analysis further ruled out that outcome-based learning play a role in these processes.</p><p>We re-analyze a previously published dataset that stands out as containing the largest sample size among the studies analyzed (N=446) and as proposing an influential cognitive model of decision-making (see next paragraph) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> , despite featuring some important limitations (it involved only complete feedback, the feedback and no-feedback conditions featured different number of trials and always appeared in the same order, there was no clear manipulation of the instructions). In order to replicate our analyses as comprehensively as possible, we restricted this re-analysis to the decision problems that feature identical or similar properties to ours, namely decisions opposing a sure to a risky option (to define risky choice rate), decisions involving options with different expected values (to define optimal choice rate) and decisions featuring non-extreme probabilities (excluding 1% or 99%) for the risky option. We also excluded trivial decision problems in which one option dominates the other (see  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure    6B</ref>). Having in mind the fact that Erev et al. (2017) featured complete feedback we looked at the effect of feedback specifically for different probability levels (low: prob≤0.25, medium: 0.25&lt;prob&lt;.075, high: prob≥0.75) of the risky high-value outcome. As expected by the regret hypothesis, and consistent with our own findings, the effect of feedback monotonically scaled with the risky best-outcome probability ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6C</ref>; low: -0.053±0.317; medium: 0.038±0.209; high: 0.132±0.329). Note, that the negative effect observed in the low condition is also consistent with the regret account we described above and it is a result of Erev's data set including decision problems with negative outcomes. Indeed, if we split the low-probability problems in those containing only non-negative outcomes (as in our design) and those containing negative outcomes, we see that in the former set the effect is absent (as in our data), while the latter set exhibits a negative effect. This could originate from the fact that in the decision problems including negative outcomes the magnitude of the safe option is bigger relative to a range that extends in the negative domain. Moreover, we looked at the trial-bytrial dynamics and found a negative recency pattern, consistent with a gambler's fallacy bias ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 6D)</ref>. Finally, while the manipulation of instructions was not present as such in , the different orders of presentation of decision problems allowed us to perform an analogous analysis, which further supports a first-trial/attitudinal effect (for the details look  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BEAST model and key behavioral results</head><p>Having confirmed that all the results that we could test in Erev et al.

The unbiased tool consists of mental draws either from the objective described distribution of the prospects, in case of no feedback, or from the realized one, in case of feedback. Crucially, the reliance on the observed history of outcomes when feedback is present makes the BEAST model a learning model. The unbiased tool captures the tendency to minimize immediate regret -or, to put it another way, it captures the tendency to prefer the option that gives the best outcome most of the time. The reliance on the unbiased tool increases as the subject receives more feedback, thereby making the impact of regret stronger.</p><p>We fitted the participants' data of our experiments 1-6 to the BEAST model and then we ran simulations with the fitted parameters to compute predicted choice probabilities for each subject. The model predictions replicate the main effect of feedback in increasing R-rates, but fail to capture the effect induced by the manipulation of block instructions -the effect of feedback is absent in the first trial independently of the presence or absence of the block instructions ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 7A &amp; 7B)</ref>. This is an expected result, since the BEAST attitudinal changes occurring before any feedback are experienced play no role. When it comes to the interaction of feedback with probability, model predictions capture very accurately the complete feedback case, but fail to capture the partial feedback case <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">(Figure 7C, 7D &amp; 7E)</ref>. This is also an expected result, given that the regret component of the BEAST model does not depend on feedback regimen and is equally deployed in partial and feedback condition.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In the present study, we aimed to clarify the effect of feedback on description-based decisionmaking. This represents a pressing question in behavioral decision-making research as many (if not most) real-life decisions feature both description (in various forms) and feedback (we enjoy -or suffer -the consequences of our choices). Our investigations aimed to address two (related) research questions. First, the directionality of the effect on two main outcome measures, namely risk aversion and value maximization. Second, the cognitive mechanisms underpinning the effect. To address these questions, we devised a series of original experiments designed to overcome some frequent (if not systematic) limitations identified in previous studies.</p><p>Regarding the directionality of the effect of feedback on decision-making under risk, we found that the presence of feedback increased the propensity to choose the risky option. Because it falls in line with the majority of studies surveyed in our literature review, we argue that this result can be considered credible, robust and replicable <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref> . In light of the strength of our empirical evidence (including several experiments, different levels of outcomes, probabilities, gains and losses and an overall extremely large sample size), we believe that the occasional reports of negative effects might be attributed to peculiarities of the design of the related studies -but further investigation would be needed to verify this.</p><p>Our experimental design also allowed us to confidently establish that the presence of feedback had no (beneficial or detrimental) effect on the optimal (i.e., EV-maximizing) choice rate: risky choice rate was increased by feedback regardless of whether or not the risky option was more advantageous. This question was somehow overlooked in the literature, as most of the surveyed studies actually did not allow for testing this effect, either because they featured risky option which was consistently associated with the highest expected value <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> , or because they used decision problems where the risky and the sure/safe option had the exact same expected values <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> . The lack of clarity and investigation of the effect of feedback on choice optimality is surprising since feedback is often suggested as a possible way to correct decision-making biases and improve decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . Of note, once restricted to the subset of decision problems that are relevant to our investigation, a re-analysis confirmed our main results in a large dataset originally published by <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Erev et al. (2017)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to disambiguating the directionality (and amplitude) of feedback-induced changes in risk preferences, our study also provides further insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying these effects. In the literature, the (more or less explicit) standard assumption is that experiencing decision outcomes affect the subjective beliefs characterizing the probability of realization of those outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> . In other terms, the effects of feedback are traditionally conceived as the result of a learning process due to the sampling experience. Although predominant, the learning hypothesis has rarely been empirically challenged and compared to plausible alternatives, one of which being that the presence of feedback changes the attitude of a subject to make a risky decision. This attitudinal change can naturally be induced by the anticipation of the (informational and emotional) state that results from receiving the feedback.</p><p>In order to evaluate the merit of this alternative hypothesis, we designed a new experimental manipulation that consisted of disclosing (or not) whether the upcoming block of trials would feature explicit feedback. This manipulation allowed us to reveal a simple but unambiguous behavioral signature of an attitudinal change: when subjects were informed about the presence of feedback, its effect was present in the first trial, in decisions that preceded the disclosure of the first feedback. Furthermore, when looking at the experiments without block instructions, we observed that the effect of feedback on risk preference was present from the second trial regardless of which choice had been made or which outcome had been received in the first trial, further confirming that the change in risk preference was due to a sudden change in attitude, rather than being based on feedback integration.</p><p>These results unambiguously falsify the learning hypothesis as a sole determinant of the effect of feedback on risky decision-making, given that the effect of feedback is present before any actual learning could occur.</p><p>Several cognitive processes or psychological motives can actually underpin this attitudinal effect toward feedback. Our results, when restricted to the experiments featuring partial feedback (i.e., only the outcome of the chosen option was presented) are consistent with a curiosity-driven attitudinal change <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> : since the outcome of the sure option is known with certainty before making a choice, choosing the risky option is the only way to resolve the uncertainty characterizing the outcome of the whole decision situation. These results are in line with the epistemic curiosity literature that shows that subjects attribute a positive utility and actively seek uncertainty resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> . However, while providing a satisfactory interpretation of the effects on risky decisions in the partial feedback condition, curiosity-driven motives cannot account for the fact that these effects persist under completed feedback conditions (i.e., when the outcomes of both the chosen and the unchosen options were presented). To shed light on this incongruity, we analyzed the effect of feedback as a function of the probability level of the risky option. This analysis revealed that, while the effect of feedback seemed undistinguishable in the partial and complete feedback experiments at the aggregate level, clear differences emerged when splitting across probability levels. More specifically, the feedbackinduced increase in risk-taking was a monotonic function of the probability of the risky option, a pattern consistent with the idea that increased risk-taking in the complete feedback experiments is induced by the willingness to reduce the chance of experiencing regret <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> . The rationale underlying this interpretation can be broken down into two main steps. First, regret is typically thought to be elicited -in the context of value-based decision-making -by the comparison between the obtained and the forgone outcome, and is, therefore, more salient in complete feedback environments (where this comparison can actually be directly observed).</p><p>Second, the risky option minimizes the chance of experiencing regret, specifically when the probability associated with the best possible outcome is high. Of note, as far as the analyses could be replicated, the results of Erev et al. (2017), which only featured complete feedback, also indicated an interaction between the effect of feedback and the probability of the risky option, suggestive of a regret minimization.</p><p>Although explaining our current results requires assuming two different psychological processes operating in the two informational regimens, we note that regret and curiosity have been shown to interact in other experimental (and real-life) situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> . Further research will be needed to better characterize the relation (cooperation or competition) between these two motives. Our results add up to the behavioral literature, spanning from reinforcement learning to behavioral economics, showing that partial and complete feedback situations may elicit (radically) different cognitive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> .</p><p>Evidence for an attitudinal influence (as manifested by the first-trial effect) does not rule out the possibility that learning processes operate in parallel and influence choices. To test this hypothesis, we looked at feedback-induced trial-by-trial choice adjustments. We reasoned that virtually all instantiations of learning, be they rooted in Bayesian update or Reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67</ref> , generate positive recency effects, i.e. predict that the probability of choosing a risky option should increase following a rewarded risky choice. Critically, this is also true for decision-by-sampling models, such as the BEAST, which supposes mental samples of the outcomes are drawn from the empirical (i.e., experienced) distribution. Accordingly, having experienced positive outcomes in the past should increase the likelihood of repeating the same 26 choice. In striking contrast with the prediction of the learning hypothesis, our analysis revealed a negative recency pattern: a positive feedback in the preceding trial reduced the chance of repeating a risky option. Our re-analysis of Erev et al. 2017 provided further support in favor of a negative recency (gambler's fallacy) effect. This prima facie puzzling behavioral effect can be understood as a manifestation of what is called the gambler's fallacy, i.e., the fact that human subjects tend to misrepresent the independence of probabilistic outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> . This interpretation is further confirmed by the fact that this effect interacted with the probability of the risky outcome, such that the negative recency effect was stronger when the probability of the risky outcome was lower: a situation where the gambler fallacy intuition suggests that two consecutive lucky strikes appear almost impossible. These results not only rule out the possibility that residual feedback-induced learning effects are at play but also suggest that an explicit description of the probabilistic process may create (biased) prior expectations that prevent learning processes.</p><p>Taken together, our observations significantly challenge any cognitive model relying on learning process as a mechanism of the effect of feedback on decision-making under risk, be it routed in reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> , Bayesian <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> or decision-by-sampling theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . Concretely, we found the influential BEAST model, which supposes that once feedback is available values are constructed by (mentally) sampling outcomes from the empirical distribution falls short of capturing critical features of behavioral results, such as the first trial effect and the negative recency effect. Also of note, while the BEAST model does capture the role of regret, it is not equipped to deal with the shape of effects highlighted in the partial feedback condition. Our results, therefore, suggest that the BEAST model to be continued used as a valid model of human decision-making should undergo major restructuring vis-à-vis several key structure features <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> . Our findings also tell a cautionary tale against validating computational cognitive models using choice prediction, data-driven competitions, which, focusing on quantitative metrics and aggregate data, may miss critical features of human behavior that can be highly diagnostic of the underlying cognitive mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> .</p><p>To conclude, our findings shed new lights on the behavioral effects of feedback in descriptionbased decisions under risk, and on their underlying psychological mechanisms beyond learning.</p><p>Because of the ubiquity of those situations, elucidating the effect of feedback in descriptionbased scenarios can improve our understanding of apparent decision anomalies relevant for many real-life situations and give us the opportunity to improve our policies. In particular, our results suggest that, contrary to what common sense could dictate, providing feedback cannot be considered as a panacea to correct decision-making biases, notably because the effects of feedback are at least partially mediated by attitudinal changes rather than purely driven by learning processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> . Our results add up to an increasing body of evidence highlighting complex interactions between description-and experience-based choices that are currently not well accounted for by standard models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> .</p></div>

It is worth noting that all our main results replicate when we drastically lower our exclusion criteria (keeping participants with less than ten missing trials and with an accuracy in the catch block of at least 6/10), thereby including 609/620 participants in the analysis.</p><p>No participants were excluded from the analysis of the laboratory experiment. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design</head><p>The online experiments started with participants giving their consent to participate, followed by detailed instructions on the behavioral task, the structure of the experiment, and the compensation. Afterward, participants went through training which was a mini version (four blocks of five trials each) of the actual experiment featuring similar yet not identical decision problems to the ones of the actual experiment.</p><p>Then, participants started the actual experiment which consisted of 24 blocks (12 decision problems with and without feedback, as described in the main text) and a catch block (see below) in the middle of the actual experiment. The 24 blocks were comprised of 10 trials each and were randomized within and across participants. The actual experiment was divided into three sessions between which the participants were given the opportunity to take a self-paced break.</p><p>Each block started with a screen providing block instructions about the presence or absence of feedback in the upcoming block (Exps 2, 4, 5, 6) or just prompting the participants to start the block by clicking on the "Start Block" button (Exps 1 &amp; 3). This step was self-paced. Then, the two options (their magnitude and probability) were presented side-by-side, with a clickable white square below each option. The position of the options (left or right) was randomized.</p><p>Also, the relative vertical position of the magnitude and the probability (magnitude above and probability below or vice versa) was randomized across participants (but was constant within participants). Participants could make their choice at their own pace by clicking the white square below their preferred option. The outcome of the risky (or the safe) option was determined by an independent random draw -by definition, the outcome of the sure option was fixed. After the choice was made and the outcomes were determined, the outline of the selected square/option was highlighted and inside the white square, the outcome of the chosen option was revealed (showing the obtained points) or hidden (showing a question mark) for 1500ms.</p><p>In experiments where complete feedback was used, the forgone outcome was revealed as well (showing the points of the unchosen option) or hidden (showing a question mark) in a light gray font (in contrast to the standard black font for the obtained outcome). (note partial feedback means that the outcome only of the chosen option is revealed; complete feedback means that the outcome of both the chosen and the unchosen option is revealed). Then, the next trial started showing the same options (potentially in a different position). At the end of the block a screen marking the end of the block was presented for 1500ms.</p><p>In the middle of the actual experiment, a catch block featuring the trivial choice between a sure option (probability = 100%) giving 5 points and a sure option giving 30 points was presented.</p><p>The actual block was identical to all the rest blocks of the actual experiment. The related exclusion criterion (participants that scored below 9/10 correct answers in the catch block were excluded from the analysis) enabled us to ensure that participants understood and paid attention to the task.</p><p>At the end of the online experiments, participants were informed about the randomly selected trial and the associated monetary bonus, about their total compensation and they were redirected to the recruiting platform (Prolific) to formally complete their participation.</p><p>The laboratory experiment was conducted at the laboratory of Département des Etudes Cognitives at Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris. Participants were told their rights and gave their consent. They completed a mathematical questionnaire assessing their ability to make multiplication. The experimenter explained the task using a visual support and read an example of a gamble that might be encountered by the decision maker to ensure that they understand the possible outcomes of the gamble. Participants were told to maximize their gains and minimize their losses.</p><p>On the computer, participants were presented with an instruction screen indicating the type of information that they would be facing in the block. Individuals read "réalisation révélée essai par essai -feedback provided after each trial" or "réalisation cachée -feedback not provided" and were informed that, at the end of the block, they would be told the number of points gained or lost at that block. After reading the instruction, participants were presented with two options side by side on the screen. Each was associated with a geometrical shape and two labels: one gave information on the probability of occurrence of the outcome and the other, on the magnitude of the outcome. The shapes and their color varied randomly throughout the experiment and across participants. Colors and the brightness of the screen were adjusted to prevent eye fatigue and for easy reading. Labels describing the magnitude and the probability of each lottery figure were above and below the shapes. For half of the participants, the probabilities are always above and the magnitude below. For the other half of the sample, the labels are reversed. The position of the risky and the sure lotteries was randomized within and across blocks. Participants could not anticipate their position and therefore have to stay attentive during the sequential choices. Choices were made using a mouse. After each one, an arrow indicated the localization of the choice, disappeared after 500ms to be replaced by a text at the place of the label of the magnitude of the chosen lottery. The text indicated either the number of points gained or lost (e.g : -32pts) or hid them (XX pts) -as in the online experiments, the outcome of the risky lottery was determined by an independent random draw. The disclosure of the points depended on the type of information provided at the beginning of the block. 1.5s after, another screen appeared with the second round of choice providing exactly the same gamble as before. At the end of the sequence of 10 choices, the accumulated points were shown on the screen. Most steps of the task were self-paced such that the participant could read and take as much time as needed for the instruction, the choice and the bonus screens. The experiment was divided in three sessions to avoid fatigue. Participants were given feedback on their total points accumulated at the end of each session. At the end of the experiment, their payoff was computed on the basis of their total points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Decision Problems</head><p>By experimental design, the magnitude and the probability of the risky option were determined -and by definition the probability of the sure option was determined too. Given these, we computed the magnitude of the sure options, for Experiments 1-4, so that the EV difference of the risky and the sure option was at 5%. Namely, '()* : = (1 + (1 − 2 * riskyBetter)0.05) )@'AB )@'AB</p><p>In the end, we rounded the mag_sure towards the direction that agrees with the riskyBetter factor (if riskyBetter=1, we rounded mag_sure with the floor and if riskyBetter=0 with the ceiling function).</p><p>Safe options (Experiments 5 &amp; 6) had also defined probabilities (50/50) and were set such that 'IJ* = '()* . Additionally, one of the two magnitudes was set equal to the EV_risky, so that both outcomes of the safe option were above (below) EV_risky when riskyBetter=0 (=1). So, the two outcomes for the safe option satisfied the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">'IJ*K = )@'AB &amp; 'IJ*L = 2 '()* − 'IJ*K</formula><p>In the laboratory experiment (Experiment 7), the EV of the two options was set to be equal.</p><p>Hence, the magnitude of the sure option was determined given the magnitude and the probability of the risky one. Rounding to the closest integer was used in this experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>The main analyses included two dependent variables: risky choice (1 if one chooses the risky option and if one chooses the sure/safe one) and optimal choice (1 if one chooses the Expected Value-maximizing choice; 0 otherwise). We ran a regression analysis using a Generalized</p><p>Linear Mixed-Effects model (GLME). We used the canonical link function for response variables with the binomial distribution, namely the logit function. The method for estimating model parameters was maximum likelihood and the analysis was run with R. The predictors were feedback (categorical: absent/present), riskyBetter (categorical: no/yes), the probability of the risky option (categorical: low, medium, high for .1, .5, .9 respectively), the magnitude of the risky option (categorical: low and high for 40 and 60 respectively) and trial (continuous: from 1 to 10). In the basic model, we included the main effects. Specific pairwise interactions were also added when they were relevant. To account for individual differences, we incorporated a random effects structure with random intercepts and random slopes at the participant level. The main effects of all predictors were included as random slopes (the only exception being the predictor trial in the optimal choice case, which had a very small variance and led to singular fitting; therefore, it was excluded).</p><p>We also ran similar regressions for the dependent variable repeatRisky (1 if one chooses the risky option and 0 if one chooses the sure/safe one at time t, conditional on choosing the risky option at time t-1). The predictors were the probability of the risky option (specified as above)</p><p>and whether the previous (at time t-1) risky outcome was zero or positive (categorical: 0/1). As fixed effects, we included a basic model with the main effects only and a full model with the interaction too. Only the main effects of the predictors were used as random slopes. Note that the analysis was run only on feedback blocks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling</head><p>The Best Estimation And Sampling Tools (BEAST) model contains six free parameters -with one capturing attitudes towards ambiguity, so it is irrelevant to us. The key idea behind the BEAST model is that it assumes decisions to be determined by a combination of the best estimation of the expected value of an option and its subjective value determined by different sampling tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . Four parameters in the model are dedicated to quantify the weight of different sampling tools (i.e., rules for drawing and comparing hypothetical outcomes) as well as parameters governing the probability of using one of these tools. In the original publication the authors estimated the best-fit parameters on a population level, allowing parameters of individual agents to be drawn from U(0, parambest-fit) or {1,…, parambest-fit) (depending on whether the parameter is continuous or discrete). Mean squared deviation and some additional constraints to capture various fundamental behavioral phenomena were used for estimating these population parameters. For all the details of the model and its optimization we refer to the original publication .</p><p>We used a different approach. We fixed a search space on the population level which was quite wider than the one resulting from the original optimization (the best fits for the parameters (σ, β, γ, θ, κ) was (7, 2.6, .5, 1, 3) in Erev, et al. (2017) while we used <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref> as the search space). We computed the best-fit parameters on the participant level using maximum likelihood estimation (note that we fixed the individual parameters on the participant level and simulated each decision problem one hundred times to obtain the predicted R-rates for each subject). Then we ran simulations using the fitted parameters of each participant to obtain the predictions of the BEAST model and compare them with the behavioral data (but note that we also produced simulations using the originally proposed best-fitting parameters which lead to the very same conclusions).</p><p>We also submitted our data to a modeling analysis which involved a standard descriptive behavioral model -a variant of cumulative prospect theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref> . Details about the model, the fitting procedures following standard guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76</ref> , and the resulting statistical analyses can be found in the Supplementary Materials/Cognitive modeling (Prospect Theory).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Everything else was kept the same as in Exp.1.At the aggregate level Exp.2 replicated Exp.1 in all respects(Figure 1C and 1D; Figure 2D</figDesc></figure>

This result illustrates that our key findings are not idiosyncratic to some design choices, and might therefore reflect a generalizable psychological effect. Leveraging this robustness, we completed our demonstration by a comprehensive assessment of our main claims, evaluated over our six experiments. This analysis confirmed that the attitudinal effect induced at the first trial was robustly elicited in the experiments featuring block instructions (Exps 2,4,5,6; Figure 4B) and vanished in the absence of the said instructions (Exps 1,3; Figure 4A). Consistent with different psychological mechanisms operating under partial or complete feedback regimens, the effect of feedback was identical across all levels of the probability of the risky option in the partial feedback experiments (Exps 1,2,4; Figure 4C), while significantly modulated by this factor in the complete feedback experiments (Figures 4D</figDesc></figure>

The research was carried out following the principles and guidelines for experiments including human participants provided in the Declaration of Helsinki (1964, revised in 2013). The INSERM Ethical Review Committee/IRB00003888 approved the study on 13 November 2018, and participants were provided written informed consent before their inclusion. For the laboratory experiment, 30 healthy participants completed the experiment (18 females | aged 28 ± 7.22). Given Bellemare et al. 73 assert that 20 subjects are needed in a within-subject analysis to achieve a power of 80%, a sample size of 30 is expected to have enough power to detect any effect. The choice of model to analyze the dataset, the generalized mixed effect model, also requires a smaller sample size than traditional ANOVA. Participants were contacted via the "Relais d'information en sciences de la cognition" (RISC), part of the French "Centre national de la recherche scientifique". Participants enroll on the platform and as such, voluntarily accept to be contacted for scientific studies. Participants were recruited on the basis of their good understanding of French. They received an email in their mailing list containing a link to a questionnaire asking them for general information. After completion, they are contacted by the experimenter to agree on the day of the experiment. The experiment was approved by the local Ethics Committee of Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris.

Additionally, we incentivized participants to reveal their true preferences by offering a monetary bonus determined by the outcome of a randomly selected trial of the testing phase (average bonus won in British pounds: 2.68 ± 2.21). For the laboratory experiment, participants received a show-up fee of 10€ for an average engagement of 45 minutes. To motivate the revelation of true preferences, an incentive system was settled on the basis of hypothetical gains or losses. Each decision gave a pay-off in points -a draw from the selected option payoff distribution. They were told that their goal was to maximize their number of points in the gain domain and to minimize the number of losses. The total of points would determine their final payoff. The conversion rate between experimental units (EU) and euros was set according to the maximum and minimum possible payoffs at 0.02€/EU. The payoff structure was determined such that no participant would incur a loss. On average, they received 15€. At the end of the experiment, participants received and signed the reception of their payments.</figDesc></figure>
