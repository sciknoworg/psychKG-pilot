			<abstract>
				<p>Older adults are frequently targets of financial fraud. Therefore, understanding how cognitive changes across adulthood impact social decisions with economic stakes is critical. We investigated, in adults aged 18-92, how memory for previous interactions influences social decisions, and how those decisions differ from analogous, non-social choices. While their memory deficits led to poorer decisions in both domains, older adults also had several biases that made their social decisions especially maladaptive: they tended to remember that others were generous, they interacted with familiar others regardless of what they remembered about them, and they chose partners who appeared generous, even when they were not. Thus, older adults may make financially costly social decisions when those decisions depend on recalling specific past experiences.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract</head><p>Older adults are frequent targets and victims of financial fraud. They may be especially susceptible to re-victimization because of age-related changes in both episodic memory and social motivation. Here we examined these factors in a context where adaptive social decision-making requires intact associative memory for previous social interactions. Older adults made more maladaptive episodic memory-guided social decisions, but not only because of poorer associative memory. Older adults were biased toward remembering people as being fair, while young adults were biased toward remembering people as being unfair. Holding memory constant, older adults engaged more with people that were familiar (regardless of the nature of the previous interaction), whereas young adults were prone to avoiding others that they remembered as being unfair. Finally, older adults were more influenced by facial appearances, choosing to interact with social partners that looked more generous, even though those perceptions were inconsistent with prior experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Older adults make many economic decisions, control substantial wealth, and are often targets of financial fraud. About 5% of cognitively unimpaired older adults are victims of financial fraud each year, a figure that is likely an underestimate (1, 2).</p><p>Therefore, understanding how aging impacts economic decisions involving social partners is of critical importance. Many such decisions require people to retrieve details about specific previous episodes using episodic memory. For example, if you lose money to a scammer once, and that scammer contacts you again, you must remember the previous interaction to successfully avoid the scammer again. Aging might impact episodic memory-guided social decision-making in a few ways. Older adults display episodic memory deficits <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref> and impaired value-based decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. In addition, aging is associated with changes in social motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>, with older adults being relatively more prosocial and trusting <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref>. These factors might operate independently or interact with each other to yield financially costly decisions. The goal of the current study was to examine how age-related changes in episodic memory and social motivation impact episodic memory-guided social decision-making.</p><p>Most research on memory-guided decision-making has focused on how repeated experiences with actions and associated outcomes shape decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref>. However, people often make decisions based on episodic memory for single previous experiences. A previous study of episodic memory-guided decision-making in young adults showed that associative memory -that is, memory for an association between a stimulus and its value -was necessary to support adaptive approach and avoidance decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>. In that study, participants viewed trial-unique images of houses (representing lotteries) along with their payouts. They later made decisions about whether to approach or avoid those stimuli. When participants correctly recalled the value of the stimulus, they made the financially advantageous choice to approach highvalue stimuli and avoid low-value stimuli. When they only had recognition memory for an item, however, they were unable to discriminate between high-and low-value stimuli in their decisions. The same pattern was observed for social decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16)</ref>.</p><p>Participants learned how much other people shared with an anonymous other out of $10 (in a Dictator Game). They later approached social partners that they remembered to have been more generous and avoided those who shared less. Thus, associative memory is necessary for adaptive decisions in both the social and non-social domains.</p><p>However, social and non-social decisions differed in one sense: associative memory was better for unfair Dictator Game splits compared to low-value houses, which led to greater avoidance of unfair others. In other words, young adults were especially sensitive to unfairness, a finding consistent with other research showing that young adults have a "negativity bias" in the social domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18)</ref>.</p><p>Aging might affect behavior in this paradigm in a few ways. First, older adults have well-documented deficits in associative memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19)</ref>. We therefore expect older adults to show a deficit in episodic memory-guided decision-making to the extent that their associative memory is worse than that of young adults. Second, since aging is associated with changes in social motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20)</ref>, the social negativity bias observed in young adults may not extend to older adults. According to Socioemotional Selectivity Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22)</ref>, the limited time horizon faced by older adults leads them to prioritize the maintenance of social relationships over other goals, such as knowledge acquisition and financial preparedness. Young adults might therefore be more protective of their financial resources even if it means being less prosocial, whereas older adults might be more interested in cultivating and preserving social relationships than in increasing their financial resources. Thus, in line with the predictions of Socioemotional Selectivity Theory, we expect that older adults will be less sensitive to fairness violations than young adults are, and will instead make similar avoidance decisions in the social and non-social domains. They may even seek out interactions with familiar others, irrespective of the financial consequences of doing so.</p><p>Finally, if older adults are less able to use episodic memory to make social decisions, they may turn to a more automatic, heuristic strategy, such as evaluating a social partner based on their physical appearance. People form impressions of others based on their facial appearance, with some facial features being systematically associated with perceptions of trustworthiness and other traits <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref>. Appearance can then affect approach behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(26)</ref> and memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28)</ref>. It is unknown, however, whether appearance still influences social decisions when the decision-maker has had a previous interaction with that partner. We expected that older adults might rely on facial appearances more in their decisions, consistent with their inability to inhibit automatic processes and irrelevant information <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31)</ref>, and with their increased reliance on stereotypes in other contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(34)</ref>.</p><p>Here we recruited adults aged 18-92 to perform an episodic memory-guided decision task with social and non-social conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>. We hypothesized that older adults would make less adaptive decisions in both social and non-social contexts because of their worse associative memory. However, we also expected that older adults' social decisions would be even more impaired than their non-social decisions, due to their inclination to prioritize social relationships over monetary gains, as well as their increased reliance on facial appearances when making these decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participant characteristics</head><p>Two hundred and ten participants from three age groups -young (ages 18-35; n = 76), middle-aged (ages ; n = 70) and older adults (ages 60+; n = 64; <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>)were included in the final sample. Older adults were recruited primarily from the Clinical Core of Penn's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC; n = 46). These participants are part of a longitudinal cohort that undergoes neuropsychological assessments and consensus conference designation to assess their cognitive status annually; all participants from this cohort were deemed cognitively normal. Additional participants were recruited through advertisements on campus (n = 111) or Facebook (n = 53). We found no differences in memory performance between the older adults from the ADRC cohort and those recruited separately (see SI Appendix). We collected the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading from all participants to ensure that age groups were matched on intelligence (F(2,118) = 0.16; p = 0.854). Age groups were also matched on gender composition (χ 2 = 0.32; p = 0.854; n = 208).</p><p>About half the participants completed the experiment in person, and about half completed it remotely while on a video call with an experimenter. When examining general item and associative memory performance, we found no differences between participants who did the task remotely and those who did it in the lab (see SI Appendix), so we collapsed across testing modalities in our analyses. Participants first learned associations between stimuli and reward outcomes ($5 or $0). In one block of this "Reward phase," they saw faces of people who had previously come into the lab. These previous participants were asked how much of $10 they would share with an anonymous other person (i.e., they played a Dictator Game as proposer). We consider photos of those who split the $10 evenly as high-value stimuli (since they gave $5 to the participant), and those who kept all the money for themselves as low-value (since they gave $0). In another block of the Reward phase (order counterbalanced), participants viewed photos of houses that were randomly paired with either $0 (low-value) or $5 (high-value) in a lottery. Following the Reward phase, participants did a 5-min anagrams distractor task. Then they proceeded to the Decision task, in which they decided whether to interact with each of the faces and houses again, or instead with a face or house chosen at random. Finally, they did a Memory task, in which item and associative memory, as well as confidence in associative memory, were assessed (see Methods, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>).</p><p>In the Reward phase, participants reported feeling better about high-value outcomes compared to low-value outcomes, and this difference was more pronounced in the social domain. These ratings did not, however, differ by age (see SI Appendix). rewards (high-value stimuli) and half resulting in $0 (low-value stimuli). Then, after a 5minute anagrams task (included to create a delay between study and test), participants saw 96 decision trials in the Decision task, with face trials and house trials intermixed.</p><p>All stimuli from the Reward task were shown again, along with 32 novel stimuli (16 faces, 16 houses). In face trials, participants had 5 s to decide if they wanted to interact with the face again, knowing they would have to accept the offer proposed by the person pictured. In house trials, subjects decided whether they wanted to play the lottery associated with the house again. Then a bracket appeared for 1 s around the option that they chose. Finally, in the self-paced Memory task, participants saw intermixed face and house trials, in which they judged whether they had seen the stimuli before on a scale from definitely old (1) to definitely new <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. If they selected 1, 2, or 3, they then saw three additional questions probing the value of the stimulus, the confidence in that value, and whether they remembered playing with that stimulus in the decision phase. All stimuli from the Reward task were shown in the Memory task, along with 32 novel stimuli. See Methods for full details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Age is associated with worse associative memory, and a response bias in associative memory for social stimuli</head><p>We took a signal detection approach to analyzing memory data, obtaining measures of d' for item memory (i.e., discriminability between old and new stimuli) and</p><p>for associative memory (i.e., among item hits, the ability to accurately categorize stimuli as high-value or low-value). As in previous research (15), we excluded responses of 3</p><p>("not sure") for the item memory question, counted responses of 1 and 2 as "old," and counted responses of 4 and 5 as "new." We also obtained measures of response bias for item and associative memory; higher response biases for item memory indicate a tendency to label items as "new," and higher response biases for associative memory indicate a tendency to label items as "low-value" (see Methods).</p><p>Age was associated with both discriminability and response bias in item memory.</p><p>In all age groups, for both faces and houses, item memory was above chance (see SI Appendix). Age was negatively associated with item memory (d') for both faces (r = -0.42; p &lt; 0.001) and houses (r = -0.32, p &lt; 0.001), such that older adults were worse at discriminating between old and new stimuli. Age was also negatively associated with response bias for both faces (r = -0.34; p &lt; 0.001) and houses (r = -0.29; p &lt; 0.001),</p><p>with older adults being more likely to endorse having seen an item earlier.</p><p>Age was also associated with both discriminability and response bias in associative memory. Associative memory was above chance in all age groups (see SI Appendix). Age was negatively associated with associative memory performance, with older adults being less likely to correctly categorize previously seen items as being high ($5) or low ($0) value (faces: r = -0.28; p &lt; 0.001; houses: r = -0.18; p = 0.008; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.  2a</ref>,c). Finally, age was associated with associative memory response bias in the social domain (r = -0.25; p &lt; 0.001), but not in the non-social domain (r = -0.04; p = 0.609), with these correlation coefficients being significantly different from each other (Fisher's r-to-z: z = 2.19; p = 0.014; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2b,d)</ref>. When examining these biases in each age group, young adults showed a significant response bias toward saying that faces shared $0</p><p>(mean associative memory response bias = 0.15; SD = 0.49; t75 = 2.72; p = 0.008), and older adults displayed a significant response bias toward saying that faces shared $5</p><p>(M= -0.22; SD = 0.65; t63 = -2.76; p = 0.007). Middle-aged adults did not show a significant response bias (see SI Appendix).

Age was also negatively associated with response bias in the social domain, such that older adults were more likely to report that the people they had learned about shared $5, while young adults were more likely to report that people shared $0.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Adaptive decision-making, which declines with age, depends on intact associative memory</head><p>Next, we sought to replicate previous findings that adaptive decision-making based on single previous episodes depends on associative memory. This analysis was restricted to trials that were seen in the Reward phase and correctly recognized. Trials were categorized into "memory levels" based on responses in the Memory task. If associative memory was correct (participant said the stimulus was worth "$0" when it was worth "$0," and "$5" when it was worth "$5") and the subject was confident in that response (i.e., answered "pretty sure" or "very sure" regarding confidence), then this constituted "confident correct associative memory." If associative memory was incorrect and the subject was confident in that answer, then this item was labeled as "confident incorrect associative memory." If the participant said they were guessing about the associative memory question, regardless of if they got the answer right, that trial was labeled as "item memory only." We ran a repeated-measures ANCOVA with memory level (Confident incorrect associative memory / Item memory only / Confident correct associative memory) and value ($0 / $5) as within-subjects factors, and choice (proportion of times that the "old" stimulus was chosen over the schematic image) as the dependent variable. Age was entered as a covariate.</p><p>We found that adaptive decision-making relied on associative memory. There was a significant main effect of value (F(1,163) = 20.39; p &lt; 0.001; η 2 p = 0.111), such that people were more likely to select the stimulus when it was associated with $5 than when it was associated with $0 (t163 = -2.49; ptukey = 0.014). The main effect of memory level was not significant (F(2,326) = 0.11; p = 0.900; η 2 p = 0.001). Critically, however, there was a significant value x memory level interaction (F(2,326) = 142.11; p &lt; 0.001; η 2 p = 0.466; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3)</ref>. When participants recognized stimuli and correctly and confidently recalled their value, they were more likely to approach $5 stimuli than $0 stimuli (t163 = 25.42; ptukey &lt; 0.001). In contrast, when they were confidently incorrect about the association, they were more likely to approach $0 stimuli than <ref type="bibr">$</ref>  <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">(Fig. 4a, b)</ref>. When comparing the proportion of times that the correct option was chosen to chance levels (0.5), young adults performed above chance for both face trials (mean = 0.59; SD = 0.11; t75 = 7.06; p &lt; 0.001) and house trials (mean = 0.59; SD = 0.11; t75 = 6.68; p &lt; 0.001). Middle-aged adults also performed above chance (faces mean = 0.55; SD = 0.11; t69 = 3.81; p &lt; 0.001; houses mean = 0.55; SD = 0.10; t69 = 4.78; p &lt; 0.001). The performance of older adults, however, was indistinguishable from chance for both categories of stimuli (faces mean = 0.50; SD = 0.08; t63 = 0.37; p = 0.714; houses mean = 0.51; SD = 0.08; t63 = 0.88; p = 0.382).</p><p>Though older adults made less adaptive decisions in both domains, the nature of their errors differed between the social and non-social domains. Given that older adults were biased to remember others as fair (an associative memory response bias that was not present in the non-social domain), we examined decisions to approach high-value</p><p>and avoid low-value stimuli separately, in both domains. On non-social trials, older adults approached high-value stimuli less (r = -0.14; p = 0.037; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4d</ref>) and avoided low-value stimuli less (r = -0.16; p = 0.019; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4f</ref>). In contrast, older adults were better than young adults at approaching generous others (r = 0.14; p = 0.042; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4c</ref>), but they were worse at avoiding unfair others (r = -0.44; p &lt; 0.001; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4e</ref>). Thus, in the non-social domain, older adults showed similar impairments when deciding about highvalue and low-value stimuli, but in the social domain, they specifically failed to avoid unfair others.  Age was negatively associated with adaptive avoidance behavior in both the social (e) and non-social domains (f), although the effect is stronger for social stimuli. excluded "item memory only" trials (i.e., associative memory guesses), and re-labeled each trial according to whether the value of the stimulus on that trial was confidently remembered as being high-value ("Remembered as $5") or confidently remembered as being low-value ("Remembered as $0"). Note that not all of these memories were accurate, but we were interested in whether subjects would act in accordance with what they believed to be the value of the stimulus. We ran a repeated-measures ANCOVA with choice as the dependent variable, remembered value (remembered as "$5" vs.</p><p>"$0") and stimulus type (face vs. house) as within-subjects factors, and age as a covariate. Stimuli remembered as high-value were chosen at a higher rate than stimuli remembered as low-value (main effect of remembered value: F(1,174) = 245.80; p &lt; 0.001; η 2 p = 0.586; t174 = 26.3; ptukey &lt; 0.001), but there were no differences in behavior toward faces and houses across the whole sample (see SI Appendix for full ANCOVA results).</p><p>Participants did show differences in their behavior between social and non-social domains in a manner that was modulated by age, however ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5)</ref>. First, there was a significant interaction between stimulus type (face vs. house) and age (F(1,174) = 8.69; p = 0.004; η 2 p = 0.048), such that older adults were more likely to approach familiar faces (regardless of retrieved value). Second, there was an interaction between stimulus type and remembered value (F(1,174) = 16.20; p &lt; 0.001; η 2 p = 0.085) that was significantly modulated by age (F(1,174) = 10.17; p = 0.002; η 2 p = 0.055). To interpret this three-way interaction, we ran post-hoc Pearson correlations, relating age to choices about stimuli in each of the following bins: (1) faces remembered as having shared $5, (2) faces remembered as having shared $0, (3) houses remembered as worth $5, and (4) houses remembered as worth $0. There was a significant correlation between age and choice of faces remembered as being unfair (r = 0.40; p &lt; 0.001; n = 199; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5d</ref>), but this did not extend to choices about low-value houses (r = 0.04; p = 0.558; n = 187; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5e</ref>; see SI Appendix). The difference between these correlation coefficients was significant (Fisher's r-to-z: z = 3.72; p &lt; 0.001). Therefore, older adults were more likely than young adults to choose to interact with social others that they were confident had acted unfairly toward them.</p><p>To examine the trajectory of these age-related changes, we ran the same repeated-measures ANOVA separately in each age group ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5a-c)</ref>, removing the age covariate. Young adults were more likely to avoid unfair others compared to low-value house stimuli (remembered value x stimulus type interaction: F(1,70) = 21.37; p &lt; 0.001; η 2 p = 0.234; t70 = -4.11; ptukey &lt; 0.001), but there was no difference in their behavior toward faces and houses that they remembered as being high-value (t70 = 1.98; ptukey = 0.206). There was a trend-level main effect of stimulus type (F(1,70) = 3.58; p = 0.063; η 2 p = 0.049), such that young adults tended to avoid faces more than houses overall (t70 = -1.89; ptukey = 0.063).</p><p>The middle-aged group, on the other hand, did not show a bias toward avoiding others remembered as unfair compared to low-value houses (remembered value x stimulus type interaction: F(1,61) = 0.97; p = 0.329; η 2 p = 0.016; $0 face vs. $0 house: t61 = -2.00; ptukey = 0.201; $5 face vs. $5 house: t61 = -0.97; ptukey = 0.766). Therefore, young adults' sensitivity toward social violations may not endure into middle age. Like the young adults, however, middle-aged adults tended to avoid faces more than houses in general (main effect of stimulus type: F(1,61) = 4.88; p = 0.031; η 2 p = 0.074; faces vs.</p><p>houses: t61 = -2.21; ptukey = 0.031).</p><p>Finally, older adults approached low-value faces and houses similarly (t42 = 1.86; ptukey = 0.261) and high-value faces and houses similarly (t42 = 1.64; ptukey = 0.368;</p><p>remembered value x stimulus type interaction: F1,42 = 0.13; p = 0.723; η 2 p = 0.003).</p><p>However, older adults showed a main effect of stimulus type (F1,42 = 6.65; p = 0.013; η 2 p = 0.137), such that they approached faces more than houses (t42 = 2.58; ptukey = 0.013).</p><p>Thus, older adults (but not young or middle-aged adults) approached social others more than non-social stimuli regardless of value, suggesting a general affinity for social interaction. biased toward avoiding low-value social stimuli more than non-social stimuli. When examining only trials that were confidently endorsed as being worth $5 or $0 (regardless of associative memory accuracy), participants were more likely to approach stimuli remembered as high-value and avoid stimuli remembered as low-value. Estimated marginal means are plotted, and error bars represent SE. The tendency to approach faces that were remembered as being unfair was associated with age (d).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Older adults rely more on facial features perceived as trustworthy to make decisions</head><p>So far, we have shown that older adults make maladaptive episodic memoryguided social decisions. This effect is driven not only by their worse associative memory and their prosocial associative memory response bias, but also by their tendency to approach social partners even if they remember those partners as having been unfair. If older adults are not using episodic memory to guide their social choices, then how are they making these decisions? Next, we examined if the facial appearances of the social stimuli influenced participants' choices. Face stimuli were rated by a separate sample (see Methods) on perceived warmth, competence, trustworthiness, attractiveness, and dominance. Raters were also asked to guess how much of $10 the person pictured would share in a Dictator Game ("perceived generosity", which was correlated with competence, warmth, and trustworthiness; see SI Appendix).</p><p>Older adults' decisions relied more on these perceptions of others based on their facial features. The average rating for each of these questions was obtained for each of the face stimuli from the Reward phase. These ratings were then entered into a series of mixed-effects logistic regressions with value ($5 / $0), associative memory (correct / incorrect), and the value x associative memory interaction terms as covariates of no interest (see Methods). Therefore, we controlled for normative influences on choicevalue and the extent to which it could be recalled -to see if there was an effect of facial appearance above and beyond these influences. Perceived warmth, competence, trustworthiness, attractiveness, and generosity were all associated with an increased likelihood of interacting with the social partner in the Decision phase ( <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2)</ref>. Aging was associated with an increased reliance on all these features, however, such that older adults were more likely to select others who were rated as more trustworthy, warm, attractive, competent, and generous ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>). This association with age was not just a by-product of older adults' worse associative memory, since the analysis controlled for memory effects, and there was no association between associative memory performance and the random-effects slopes on these facial attributes, even after controlling for age (see SI Appendix). Thus, irrespective of their associative memory deficits, older adults chose to interact more with generous-looking partners.</p><p>In an exploratory analysis (see SI Appendix for details), we investigated the effects of the age, gender (male or female), and race (Black, White, or Asian) of the face stimuli on decisions about whether to re-engage with them. After controlling for normative influences on choice, participants were more likely to choose social partners that were younger (b = -0.020; p = 0.001), female (b = 0.448; p &lt; 0.001), and Black (relative to White: b = 0.331; p &lt; 0.001; no effect of Asian race relative to White: b = 0.061; p = 0.487). Although there were some relationships between these effects and participant age, they were weaker than the effects of the facial attribute ratings (all rs &lt; 0.2), and would not hold when correcting for multiple comparisons (see SI Appendix for full results).  Age is associated with a reliance on perceived generosity of the face stimulus (based on facial appearance alone) in decision-making. In a mixed-effects logistic regression predicting whether the participant chose to interact with a previously seen face in the Decision phase, independent ratings of "perceived generosity" of that face predicted participants' choices to interact with those faces. The effects of value (i.e., whether that face gave $5 or $0 in the Reward phase) and associative memory (i.e., whether the value of the face was accurately remembered), as well as the interaction between value and associative memory were controlled for in the regression. Older adults relied on perceived generosity more in their decisions: the random slope for the effect of perceived generosity on choice was estimated separately for each subject, and this slope was positively associated with age. In the scatterplot above, the y-axis shows the sum of the overall fixed effect and subject-specific random effect of perceived generosity on choice. Although only perceived generosity is depicted here, other facial appearance ratings (warmth, trustworthiness, competence, and attractiveness) were also predictive of choice, and their influence on choice was also associated with age (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-hoc: Maladaptive social avoidance decisions are driven primarily by prosocial memory and decision-making biases</head><p>We found that the age-related decline in memory-guided social decision-making may be driven by a number of factors, including: item and associative memory deficits, a bias toward remembering others as fair, an inclination toward approaching partners regardless of fairness, and an over-reliance on perceptions of trustworthiness. In a posthoc multiple regression analysis, we tested which of these variables had the strongest influence on failures to avoid untrustworthy social partners. We found that prosocial motivations -both the propensity to recall that people were fair and the tendency to approach partners regardless of fairness -had the most significant impact on avoidance decisions (see SI Appendix for details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Here we examined age-related changes in social decision-making when those decisions rely on episodic memory for previous interactions. As expected, older adults had worse associative memory and displayed less adaptive decision-making in both social and non-social domains. However, in the social domain, older adults' decisionmaking deficits were specific to failing to avoid people who were previously unfair. We found three novel age-related changes that each contributed to these maladaptive social decisions. First, older adults showed a bias toward remembering people as being fair, while young adults showed a bias toward remembering people as being unfair.</p><p>Second, holding memory constant, older adults were more likely to engage with people they recognized -even if they remembered that the previous interaction was unfairwhile young adults were especially avoidant of others they remembered as being unfair.</p><p>Finally, older adults were more influenced by appearances, choosing to interact with others that are perceived as more generous, even though those perceptions did not accord with past experience.</p><p>Whether decisions were about social partners (represented by faces) or lotteries (represented by houses), memory for the association between an item and its value was necessary for adaptive approach/avoid decision-making, replicating previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">35)</ref>. Indeed, false associative memories -confident recollections that stimuli were worth the opposite of what they were actually worth -led to choices that were consistent with those memories, but actually maladaptive. Aging was associated with worse associative memory, in line with the wealth of evidence for associative memory decline in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37)</ref>. The ability to make adaptive episodic memory-based choices was thus impaired in older adults, and was not even above chance, whether the stimuli were social or non-social.</p><p>When decoupling associative memory discriminability (d') from response bias, we found that aging was associated with response bias in the social domain, but not the non-social domain: older adults were more likely to remember social partners as being fair, while young adults were more likely to remember social partners as being unfair.</p><p>Previous research with this paradigm found that young adults had better associative memory for unfair social others compared to low-value non-social stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>. That study did not disentangle discriminability from response bias, however, so it is unclear whether a bias toward reporting that people were unfair was also present in the young adults in that study. These age-related differences in response bias can partially explain why older adults specifically failed to avoid unfair others; a bias toward remembering others as generous results in increased social approach behavior, even when it is inappropriate.</p><p>Even after accounting for differences in participants' memories, however, age was positively associated with the tendency to approach social partners that were remembered as being unfair. Age group-specific follow-up analyses showed that older adults were more likely to approach social partners, regardless of their retrieved values, while young adults avoided unfair social partners more than low-value non-social stimuli. This finding is in line with the predictions of Socioemotional Selectivity Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22)</ref>, which proposes that as people age, they focus more on preserving social relationships, rather than protecting financial resources. The older adults might have been choosing to interact with people who shared money inequitably because they cared more about engaging in a social interaction with a familiar person than about earning money for themselves. This finding also dovetails with previous research on age differences in trust <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>. This literature has shown that older adults are more willing to trust others, but this age effect is strongest when older adults are faced with negative indicators of trust (i.e., unfair behavior; <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">38)</ref>. In line with this idea, we found that older adults were less likely to avoid others that they remembered as being unfair, but age was unrelated to the tendency to approach others that were remembered as being fair.</p><p>Indeed, a post-hoc multiple regression analysis suggested that prosocial biases in both memory and decision-making, which were more pronounced in older adults, explained poor social avoidance decisions even better than memory deficits did. Thus, interventions to improve social decision-making in older adults might target their disposition toward giving others "the benefit of the doubt," both in their recollections and in their behavior.</p><p>Above and beyond the effects of associative memory, participants chose to interact more with people perceived as more trustworthy, and the extent to which they did so was modulated by age. Considering that the ratings of perceived generosity, trustworthiness, warmth, competence, and attractiveness were made by an independent group of subjects, this finding speaks to the consistency with which people judge trustworthiness based on facial features <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26)</ref>. Older adults were more likely to use those spontaneous first impressions to make their choices. This is in line with research showing that older adults use schemas more <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(41)</ref> and mentalize less (42) when making social judgments, and they are less able to inhibit pre-existing stereotypes and automatic processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(33)</ref>. This result also corroborates previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34)</ref> showing that older adults are more trusting of others both when trust cues are reliable (e.g., past behavior) and when they are unreliable (e.g., facial appearance). Importantly, this tendency to rely on first impressions was maladaptive from an economic standpoint, since, consistent with past research <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(43)</ref>, there was no relationship between how much a person was perceived as having shared and how much they actually shared.</p><p>Our study has a few notable strengths. First, we examined age-related changes continuously rather than using an "extreme group" design. Including middle-aged adults in our sample gave us a glimpse into the trajectory of age-related changes. For example, middle-aged adults did not show a significant "negativity bias" in either their memories or their decision-making about social others, suggesting that increased sensitivity to social violations in young adults may not even persist into middle age.</p><p>Another strength of our study is that we obtained the sample size of an online study (200+) without sacrificing the rigor of an in-person study, since even those participants who did the task remotely were monitored and instructed just as they would have been in the lab. Finally, the majority of our older adult participants were recruited from a longitudinal cohort at Penn's ADRC, so we could ensure that they were cognitively unimpaired. We acknowledge that one limitation of our design is that the social stimuli were all pictures of young adults (ages <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. Restricting the stimulus age range was necessary, since the images were of real people who had previously come into the lab, and they were mostly young. It will be important to replicate our findings with more agediverse social partners. However, since we used a continuous age design and the majority of our participants were older than the people they were making decisions about, we think it is unlikely that our results are driven by the age composition of the stimulus set.</p><p>In sum, we found that older adults make less adaptive social decisions when they have to rely on associative episodic memories to make them. This decision-making deficit is driven both by memory decline -which affects both social and non-social choices -and by a tendency to approach familiar others even if they were previously unfair. While young adults showed a bias both toward reporting that people acted unfairly and toward avoiding interactions with those individuals, older adults showed a bias toward reporting that others were generous. Finally, older adults were even more likely than young adults to approach individuals who appeared more generous and trustworthy, despite the fact that these first impressions were not predictive of actual generosity. This research has important implications. Financial exploitation of older adults is highly prevalent, and in many cases, the perpetrator is either known to the victim or has victimized them before. Our findings suggest that revictimization in older adults may be driven by a combination of poor associative memory, a desire to interact with familiar others, and a reliance on inaccurate perceptions based on physical appearance. Future studies might uncover strategies that older adults can use to compensate for these effects. For example, since older adults are motivated by social concerns, it may be better for them to think of giving money to a scammer as a financial loss for one's family rather than a financial loss for the self. The impact of older adults' associative memory deficits and prosocial motivations on economic decision-making might be innocuous in some cases, but devastating in others. Procedure. The procedure for this experiment was adapted from <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>. The session consisted of four tasks done in the following order: Reward, Distractor, Decision, and Memory tasks (presented in E-Prime 2.0; Psychology Software Tools, Sharpsburg, PA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and</head><p>Participants were told at the outset that they would be learning about decisions made by participants who had previously come into the lab to play a Dictator Game. Then the experimenter explained the Dictator Game to participants, and gave them the opportunity to play the role of proposer in the Dictator Game. They were told that the proposer was known as "Player A" and that the people they would be learning about in the task would be referred to as "Player A" in the Reward task (described below).</p><p>Participants were also given the opportunity to make a Dictator Game decision by answering the same multiple-choice question (potential splits in $1 increments) as the participants who were part of the stimulus database.</p><p>Reward task. The Reward task consisted of a Face block and a House block. The order in which these blocks were presented was counterbalanced across participants.</p><p>On each trial of the Face block of the Reward task, participants saw a picture of a trialunique face with the words "Retrieving decision from Player A" underneath. After 1.5 s, the text was replaced with that Player A's split (e.g., "Player A: $5, You: $5) for 3 s.</p><p>Then participants viewed a screen asking them to rate how they felt about Player A's offer (1 = Good, 2 = Neutral, 3 = Bad). They had up to 4.5 s to respond. After a 1 s intertrial interval, the next Player A was presented. There were 32 face trials all together, half of which offered a $5/$5 split, and half of which offered a $10/$0 split, yielding 16 high-value and 16 low-value social stimuli. Each participant saw the same (randomly chosen) trial order, to minimize individual differences in accuracy due to order effects. In the House block of the Reward task, participants viewed pictures of houses instead, with the text underneath the house initially saying "Lottery is being generated."</p><p>Participants were told that houses represented lotteries that were arbitrarily paired with rewards. This text was replaced with the participant's outcome from that lottery (e.g., "You win: $5"). Half of the 32 house trials paid out $5 and half paid out $0, yielding 16 high-value and 16 low-value non-social stimuli. Just as in the Face block, participants were asked to rate how they felt about the outcome from each house lottery.</p><p>Distractor task. After both blocks of the Reward task, participants completed a 5-min anagrams task in which they were presented with a series of scrambled words and were given 30 s to unscramble each one.

Participants were instructed that, on Face trials, they would see two stimuli representing two different Player As and they would have to decide which Player A they would prefer to play with (i.e., who they would take a proposed split from). They were presented with two images and they had 5 s to respond by pressing "1" for left or "2" for right. On the left side of the screen, they always saw a schematic drawing of a face, and on the right, they saw a trial-unique image of a Player A from our stimulus database. Choosing the schematic drawing meant that a Player A would be selected at random from the database and their Dictator Game offer would be played out. Choosing the trial-unique image meant that the pictured Player A's Dictator Game split would be played out.</p><p>Participants were encouraged to use the information they had learned in the Reward task to make their decisions, and they were told that one of the Face trial decisions would be randomly selected, and the participant would receive the offer shared by the Player A pictured (if they chose the trial-unique image), or they would receive the offer from a randomly drawn Player A (if they chose the schematic). They were also told that the Player As pictured would be contacted and would receive the portion of the $10 that they kept for themselves. All 32 faces from the Reward task were presented, along with 16 novel Player A images.</p><p>On House trials, participants were shown a schematic line drawing of a house on the left and a trial-unique image of a house on the right, and they had 5 s to choose between them by pressing "1" or "2". The 32 houses from the Reward task were shown, along with 16 novel house images. Participants were told that one of the House trial decisions would be randomly selected and played out as well. Here, choice of the schematic line drawing or choice of a novel house image resulted in a random payout of $0 or $5, but choice of a house image from the Reward task would result in the same payout that the house was associated with earlier.</p><p>Participants thus completed 96 total decision trials, split into two blocks. They were never given feedback for their choices, but after the 5 s decision time was up, a black frame appeared for 1 s to indicate which choice the participant made. After a 1 s inter-trial interval, the next trial appeared. At the end of the study, participants were paid according to their choices on one House trial and on one Face trial.</p><p>Memory task. Finally, participants completed a Memory task, in which they were presented with the 64 images that they saw in both the Reward and Decision tasks, as well as 32 never-before-seen images (16 houses, 16 faces). All participants saw the same (randomized) trial order. On each trial, they were asked to indicate (with a key press) on a scale from 1-5 whether the image had been shown before. The scale was anchored such that 1 corresponded to a high-confidence response that the stimulus was "old," and 5 corresponded to a high-confidence response that the stimulus was "new," with 3 corresponding to "not sure." If the participant selected 1, 2, or 3, they were taken to another screen and asked what offer was given by the stimulus: $0 or $5. Then they were asked to rate their confidence in that answer (1 = very sure; 2 = pretty sure; 3 = just guessing). Finally, they were asked to rate whether or not they chose to play with that stimulus in the Decision task (1 = yes; 2 = no; 3 = don't recall). If the participant selected 4 or 5 for the item memory question, the follow-up questions were omitted and the next image was presented. The memory task was self-paced, with 1 s inter-trial intervals between stimuli.</p><p>Although previous research showed no differences in memory performance whether memory was assessed before or after decision-making (15), we ensured in a separate online experiment that the effects of associative memory on decision-making did not differ whether interaction decisions were made before memory was assessed or after (see SI Appendix). <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Reading (WTAR; 39)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analyses</head><p>Participant characteristics. To ensure that the three age groups did not differ from each other with respect to gender or intelligence, we ran a χ 2 test to examine effects of age group on gender (Male / Female; two participants who reported a gender other than Male or Female were excluded from this analysis), and a one-way ANOVA to examine effects of age group on WTAR score. We also sought to ensure that memory performance did not differ between participants who performed the task remotely and those who performed it in the lab. We ran an independent-samples t-test comparing overall item memory (d') and overall associative memory (defined here as the proportion of hits that were correctly classified as having a $5 or $0 value) between participants from these two testing modality groups. Finally, we compared the cognitively normal older adults from the Penn ADRC cohort to those who were recruited through Facebook on these measures. Since we found no significant differences, we collapsed across testing modalities in our analyses.</p><p>Self-report. We investigated effects of age, stimulus type, and value on participants' self-reported ratings in the Reward task by performing a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with stimulus type (face / house) and value ($5 / $0) as withinsubjects factors and age as a covariate.</p><p>Memory. We took a signal detection approach to analyzing the memory data. First, we obtained a measure of item memory for each subject, separately for the social and nonsocial conditions. For the item memory analysis, we did not include responses in which participants indicated a "not sure" response (i.e., a 3). We calculated successful item memory as d', in which the higher the d', the better the subject's discrimination between old and new stimuli. The d' measure was calculated as z-score (hit rate) -z-score (false alarm rate). We implemented standard correction procedures to account for hit rates of 1 and false alarm rates of 0 by adjusting extreme values by 1/2N, where N is the number of old images for hit rates, and the number of novel foils for false alarms. The d' scores were submitted to one-sample t-tests (comparing to 0), separately for each age group and stimulus type, to assess if item memory was above chance. Additionally, we estimated the response bias, as defined by -.5*(z-score (hit rate) + z-score (false alarm rate)). We also compared these to zero using one-sample t-tests, separately for each age group and stimulus type. Finally, we ran a Pearson correlation between age and (1) d' for faces, (2) response bias for faces, (3) d' for houses, and (4) response bias for houses.</p><p>In previous studies (15, 16) using a similar paradigm, associative memory was quantified as the percentage of times that the participant reported the correct stimulus value, out of the total number of item hits. However, we were interested not just in the overall associative memory accuracy, but also in whether there were any memory biases that differed as a function of age. Therefore, we also took a signal detection approach to analyzing our associative memory data. We calculated d' and response bias for associative memory for faces and houses, by considering an item as an "associative memory hit" if it was a $5 stimulus correctly identified as being worth $5, and as an "associative memory false alarm" if a $0 stimulus was identified as being worth $5 (note that this means that $0 stimuli correctly identified as being worth $0 are considered correct rejections rather than hits, but this labeling is arbitrary). Since the item hit rate was high (mean = 88%; SD = 11.5%) and did not significantly differ between $5 stimuli and $0 stimuli (t209 = 0.28; p = 0.782), we were confident that this method of analyzing the associative memory data would not be unduly biased by item memory performance. In addition to comparing the associative memory d' and response bias measures to zero using one-sample t-tests for each age group and stimulus type, we also performed Pearson correlations to investigate the relationship between age and associative memory d' and response bias measures, separately for faces and houses.</p><p>Decision-making. We were interested in the extent to which memory and stimulus value impacted decision-making, regardless of whether the stimuli were social or non-social. This analysis was restricted to trials that were (1) seen in the Reward task phase of the experiment and (2) correctly recognized as old. Trials were categorized into different "memory levels" based on responses in the Memory task, as follows. If associative memory was correct (participant said the stimulus was worth "$0" when it was worth "$0," or "$5" when it was worth "$5") and the subject expressed confidence in their associative memory response (i.e., answered "pretty sure" or "very sure" on the following question), then the item was labeled as indicative of "confident correct associative memory." If associative memory for the item was incorrect and the subject expressed confidence in that answer, then this item was labeled as reflecting "confident incorrect associative memory." Finally, if the participant indicated that they were guessing about their response for the associative memory question, regardless of if they got the answer right, that trial was labeled as reflecting "item memory only." (Note that because this category collapses across correct and incorrect trials, it makes our analysis more conservative.) We performed a repeated-measures ANCOVA on choice data, with memory level (Confident incorrect / Item memory only / Confident correct) and value ($0 / $5) as within-subjects factors and age as a covariate. As a reminder, a stimulus was considered chosen if it was picked over the schematic image. If we found any effects of age, we planned to run post-hoc Pearson correlations between age and choice in all six relevant trial bins, controlling for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction, to uncover the nature of the interaction.</p><p>We decided to exclude item misses from this analysis because, since item memory was generally excellent, we would have had to exclude almost 50% (n = 98) of our sample in order to ensure that participants had at least one item in each memory level bin, including the "no item memory" bins. By excluding item misses, we could increase the sample size for this analysis to n = 165 (~80% of the total sample).</p><p>Finally, we determined if age was associated with adaptive decision-making. We considered a decision to be adaptive if participants approached a high-value ($5) stimulus or avoided a low-value ($0) stimulus. We calculated the proportion of times out of all previously seen stimuli that participants made the adaptive choice, separately for the face and house trials, and we ran Pearson correlations between those proportions and age. In addition, we did these same analyses separately for high-value and lowvalue stimuli in both domains (i.e., we calculated the proportion of all high-value stimuli that were approached, and the proportion of all low-value stimuli that were avoided), in order to examine whether age-related changes in decision-making were driven by maladaptive approach decisions, avoidance decisions, or both.</p><p>Social vs. non-social decision-making. Next, we examined if memory-based decision-making differed if the stimuli were social or non-social. We were primarily interested in participants' capacity to use their associative memory to make decisions, so we excluded the "item memory only" trials (i.e., associative memory guesses), and re-labeled each trial according to whether the value of the stimulus on that trial was confidently remembered as being high-value ("Remembered as $5") or confidently remembered as being low-value ("Remembered as $0"). We then ran a repeatedmeasures ANCOVA with choice as the dependent variable, remembered value (remembered as "$5" vs. "$0") and stimulus type (face vs. house) as within-subjects factors, and age as a covariate. If we found any effects of age, we planned to re-run this analysis separately for each age group. We also planned to conduct post-hoc Pearson correlations between age and choice in each of the four relevant trial bins, Bonferronicorrecting for multiple comparisons.</p><p>Effects of face attributes. Finally, we examined the effects of perceived (1) trustworthiness, (2) warmth, (3) dominance, (4) competence, (5) attractiveness, and <ref type="formula">6</ref>perceived Dictator Game generosity of the face stimuli on decision-making. To this end, for each of these qualities, we took the average rating (across the n = 20 independent raters; see SI Appendix) and entered it as an independent variable in a mixed-effects logistic regression, with choice (1 = chose stimulus; 0 = chose schematic) as the dependent variable. Value (0 = $0 stimulus; 1 = $5 stimulus), associative memory (0 = incorrect associative memory; 1 = correct associative memory), and the value*associative memory interaction term were entered as covariates of no interest.</p><p>Note that correct associative memory was defined differently in this analysis, not taking into account confidence ratings, in order to ensure that all trials were included, and that each subject would have the same number of memory levels. We allowed intercepts and slopes (for the stimulus rating) to vary by subject. All participants across all age groups were included in these six mixed-effects regressions. If any of the models did not converge, we planned to drop random slopes from the model. In addition to examining the fixed effects of these face attributes, we were also interested in how these effects might vary with age. Therefore, we extracted the random-effects coefficients on the rating term for each subject and ran a Pearson correlation between these coefficients and age.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>SI Materials and Methods</head><p>Stimuli. Prior to data collection for the main experiment, we invited participants (n = 106; mean age = 24.56; SD = 7.67; range: 18-58; gender: 61 F, 44 M, 1 not reported; race and ethnicity: 45 White non-Hispanic, 1 White Hispanic, 30 Asian non-Hispanic, 19</p><p>Black non-Hispanic, 1 Black Hispanic, 7 mixed race, 1 Other Race Hispanic, 2 not reported), to the lab to complete a survey of social decisions and to have their photograph taken. Participants had three photographs taken -one in which they made a happy face, one in which they made an angry face, and one in which they made a neutral face. Only the neutral photographs were used in the current study. Participants were paid $5 for this session, which took approximately 15 minutes. They were told that they were being invited to be part of a research database, and that their decisions and photographs may be used in future studies. Participants provided their contact information, since there was a possibility that their choices would be played out for real at a later date. One of the decisions participants were asked to make in the survey was a standard Dictator Game decision, in which they were asked to imagine that they were given $10 to split between themselves and an anonymous other person. They were then asked to indicate their split from a multiple-choice menu, in which the options ranged from keeping $0 (and sharing $10) to keeping $10 (and sharing $0) in one-dollar increments.</p><p>Once the database was collected, we selected 64 neutral photographs to use as stimuli in the main experiment. 32 of these were presented in the Reward, Decision, and Memory tasks (see details in Methods). 16 additional faces were presented as novel foils in the Decision task only, and another 16 were presented as novel foils in the Memory Task only. In order to be selected as one of the 32 stimuli in the Reward task, the photographs had to be of people who selected either a "keep $10 / share $0" split or a "keep $5 / share $5" split in the Dictator Game, since half the stimuli in the Reward task were meant to be high-value and half were meant to be low-value. In addition, the stimuli were selected such that there was a balance with respect to race and gender between the high-value and low-value stimuli, since we did not want any effects of race and/or gender on memory or decision-making to be confounded with effects of stimulus value on memory or decision-making. Therefore, the final stimulus set contained four Asian female, four Asian male, four Black female, four Black male, eight White female, and eight White male faces, evenly split between the high-value ("keep $5 / share $5") and low-value ("keep $10 / share $0") categories. The individuals shown in the final stimulus set were all young adults (mean age = 25.38; SD = 5.08; range: 18-36). Since we were unable to include stimuli from all age groups (due to the sample in the database collection study being composed primarily of young adults), we decided to keep the stimulus set homogeneous with respect to age. The 32 novel stimuli had a similar race, gender, and age distribution, but note that participants never learned about the decisions of the novel stimuli, so for that set, we did include photographs of people who proposed to share amounts other than $5 or $0. Photographs were cropped such that only faces were shown.</p><p>We brought in an independent sample of participants into the lab to view all of the potential stimuli and to make judgments about them (n = 20; mean age = 22.115; SD = 2.35; gender: 16 F, 4 M; race and ethnicity: 9 White non-Hispanic, 7 Asian non-Hispanic, 4 Black non-Hispanic). The participants made ratings (scale from 0-10) of the photograph's perceived attractiveness, trustworthiness, dominance, competence, and warmth. These attributes were chosen based on previous research showing that certain facial features are associated with these qualities, and that these qualities have been linked to social decisions. Participants also were asked to imagine what the person pictured would share in a Dictator Game with an anonymous stranger (from $0-$10; we termed this variable "perceived generosity"). For each stimulus, we took the average rating for each attribute (including perceived generosity) and ran a one-way ANOVA to test if any of these ratings could differentiate stimuli who shared $5 versus those who shared $0. We found no significant effects (attractiveness: F(1, 27.7) = 0.96; p = 0.336; trustworthiness: F(1, 28.4) = 0.07; p = 0.787; dominance: F(1, 24.2) = 1.23; p = 0.278; competence: F(1, 28.1) = 0.18; p = 0.678; warmth: F(1, 25.5) = 0.44; p = 0.514; perceived generosity: F(1, 29.1) = 0.01; p = 0.928). The average ratings for attractiveness, trustworthiness, dominance, competence, warmth, and perceived generosity from this independent set of subjects were used in other analyses, described below.</p><p>The houses were color houses selected from a stimulus set provided by the Epstein lab at the University of Pennsylvania. Houses were randomly paired with $5 and $0 values.</p><p>Remote data collection. Participants who completed the task remotely underwent the same procedure with a few small changes. The Reward, Distractor, Decision and Memory tasks were presented in Qualtrics instead of E-Prime. Participants initially met with the experimenter over the BlueJeans platform, and shared their screen after opening the Qualtrics link that contained the task. The experimenter could then guide the participant through the instructions just as they would in the lab. While the participant did the task, the experimenter turned their camera and sound off in order to minimize distractions. Although the timing of the task was the same in Qualtrics as it was in E-Prime, participants made their choices in Qualtrics by clicking on an option with a mouse rather than using a keyboard. Remote participants were paid the same fees and bonuses, but these were paid via debit cards mailed to each participant on the day that the study was completed, rather than paid in cash.</p><p>Exclusion criteria. Participants were excluded if, in the Decision phase of the experiment, they either chose the stimulus or chose the schematic image more than 95% of the time (n = 10 subjects). They were also excluded if, in the Memory phase, they reported that a stimulus that they had seen gave $5 or $0 more than 95% of the time (n = 3 additional subjects). For some analyses, not all participants had values for every category (e.g., some participants had no "guess" trials or no "confident" trials).</p><p>Rather than exclude them from analyses altogether, they are left out of only those analyses for which they had missing values. The number of subjects in each analysis is specified in the text where relevant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-hoc analyses</head><p>Effects of face stimulus age, race, and gender on choice. The thirty-two face stimuli learned about in the study varied with respect to age (although all were young: age range = 18-36), gender (50% female, 50% male), and race (50% White, 25% Asian, 25% Black). We did an exploratory analysis to examine if any of these demographic variables impacted choice, above and beyond the normative effects of value and memory. To examine the effects of stimulus age, we ran a mixed-effects logistic regression, with age as a continuous independent variable and choice (1 = chose stimulus; 0 = chose schematic) as the dependent variable. For the gender analysis, gender was coded as a two-level (Male/Female) factor variable with Male as the reference level. For the race analysis, race was coded as a three-level factor variable (White, Black, Asian), with white race as the reference level. In all three regressions, value (0 = $0 stimulus; 1 = $5 stimulus), associative memory (0 = incorrect associative memory; 1 = correct associative memory), and the value*associative memory interaction term were entered as covariates of no interest. We allowed intercepts and slopes (for the independent variable of interest) to vary by subject. All participants across all age groups were included in these three mixed-effects regressions. In addition to examining the fixed effects of these face attributes, we were also interested in how these effects might vary with participant age. Therefore, we extracted the random-effects coefficients on stimulus age, race, and gender for each subject and ran a Pearson correlation between these coefficients and participant age.</p><p>Contributors to social avoidance decisions. We found that there are several reasons why older adults may make maladaptive memory-based decisions in the social domain: item and associative memory deficits, a response bias in associative memory, a tendency to approach social partners regardless of retrieved value, and an over-reliance on perceptions of trustworthiness. We ran a post-hoc multiple regression analysis to investigate which of these factors was most predictive of failures to avoid unfair others.</p><p>We chose to focus on these low-value social trials, because, as described in the main text and illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>, older adults were actually unimpaired at choosing to approach others who were previously generous. Therefore, older adults' decisionmaking deficits in the social domain were specific to their inability to avoid unfair others.</p><p>The dependent variable in our model was, for each subject, the proportion of all previously-seen low-value social stimuli that were successfully avoided. Our model contained the following predictors. First, there were two normative influences on choice: social item memory d' and social associative memory d'. Our third predictor was social associative memory response bias (higher values indicate a greater tendency to label previously-seen stimuli as being low-value). Our fourth predictor was the difference in average "perceived generosity" between the low-value stimuli that were chosen compared to those that were not chosen (higher values suggest that this face perception variable was being considered in the decision process; note that we used this measure instead of the random-effects coefficient described in the text, in order to avoid the circularity inherent in predicting choice using a coefficient derived from a model that was used to predicted the same choices). Finally, our fifth predictor was the proportion of times that a stimulus confidently remembered as being low-value was chosen. Note that this variable is not collinear with the other predictors, since it is conditionalized on participants believing that the stimulus was worth $0; only the relative number of such trials is affected by associative memory accuracy and response bias.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Supplementary Text</head><p>Recruitment and testing methods do not significantly impact performance. About half of the participants in each group performed a remote version of the task (n = 38 in young group; n = 35 in middle-aged group; n = 33 in older group). When examining general item and associative memory performance, we found no differences between participants who performed the task remotely and those who performed it in the lab (overall item memory d': t208 = 0.69; p = 0.491; overall proportion correct out of item hits; t208 = 0.96; p = 0.336). There were also no age differences between these groups (t208 = 0.02; p = 0.983). Therefore, we decided to collapse across both of these testing modalities in our analyses. We also found no differences in memory performance between the subset of older adults who were recruited from the Penn Alzheimer's Disease Research Center cohort (n = 46) and those who were recruited via Facebook (n = 18; item memory: t62 = 0.97; p = 0.334; associative memory: t62 = 1.59; p = 0.116).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimulus ratings differ between faces and houses but not by age.</head><p>We ensured that participants were attending to the outcomes in the Reward phase by examining their ratings of how they felt after learning about lottery and dictator game outcomes (1 = "good"; 2 = "neutral", 3 = "bad"). Participants felt better after rewarded outcomes compared to unrewarded outcomes, and this difference was more pronounced in the social domain. A repeated-measures ANCOVA with stimulus type (face vs. house) and reward status ($0 vs. $5) as factors, and age as a covariate, revealed that, while there was a significant effect of reward status on ratings, F(1,206) = 368.51; p &lt; 0.001; η 2 p = 0.641; n = 208, with participants feeling more positively about being rewarded $5 compared to $0, this was qualified by a stimulus type x reward status interaction, F(1,206) = 6.81; p = 0.010; η 2 p = 0.032. This interaction was driven both by $0 faces being rated as more negative than $0 houses (t206 = 5.37; ptukey &lt; 0.001; estimated marginal means: Young adults had a liberal response bias for faces (mean criterion = -0.11; SD = 0.38; t75 = -2.53; p = 0.013), being more likely to label stimuli as "old," rather than "new," but this was not the case for houses (mean criterion = 0.08; SD = 0.49; t75 = 1.44; p = 0.153). Middle-aged adults showed a liberal response bias for both faces (mean criterion = -0.41; SD = 0.47; t69 = -7.29; p &lt; 0.001) and houses (mean criterion = -0.36; SD = 0.48; t69 = -6.19; p &lt; 0.001). Older adults were also biased toward labeling stimuli as "old" rather than "new," in both social (mean criterion = -0.60; SD = 0.78; t63 = -6.14; p &lt; 0.001) and non-social domains (mean criterion = -0.35; SD = 0.66; t63 = -4.25; p &lt; 0.001).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">$</formula><p>All three age groups were also above chance at associative memory. In other words, they were better than chance at accurately classifying stimuli as rewarded <ref type="bibr">($5)</ref> or unrewarded ($0) in both the social and non-social domain (young adults: associative As stated in the main text, young adults had a response bias toward saying that faces shared $0 (mean associative memory criterion = 0.15; SD = 0.49; t75 = 2.72; p = 0.008), a bias that did not extend to houses (mean criterion = -0.05; SD = 0.50; t75 = -0.84; p = 0.401). In contrast, older adults had a response bias toward saying that faces shared $5 (mean associative memory criterion = -0.22; SD = 0.65; t63 = -2.76; p = 0.007). This effect in older adults was also specific to the social domain (mean associative memory criterion for houses = -0.10; SD = 0.63; t63 = -1.33; p = 0.189).</p><p>Middle-aged adults did not show a significant response bias for either faces (mean associative memory criterion = 0.05; SD = 0.57; t69 = 0.73; p = 0.466) or houses (mean associative memory criterion = -0.12; SD = 0.54; t69 = -1.85; p = 0.068).</p><p>Aging impairs decision-making about low-value stimuli. As described in the main text, we ran a repeated-measures ANCOVA with memory level (Confident incorrect associative memory / Item memory only / Confident correct associative memory) and value ($0 / $5) as within-subjects factors, and choice (proportion of times that the "old" stimulus was chosen over the schematic image) as the dependent variable. Age was entered as a covariate. Aging impacted the extent to which the values of the stimuli, as well as memory for the values of the stimuli, affected decision-making: there was a value x age interaction on choice (F(1,163) = 14.57; p &lt; 0.001; η 2 p = 0.082) and a value x memory level x age interaction on choice (F(2,326) = 10.88; p &lt; 0.001; η 2 p = 0.063). The memory level x age interaction was not significant (F(2,326) = 0.39; p = 0.678; η 2 p = 0.002), and the main effect of age was not significant (F(1,163) = 3.30; p = 0.071; η 2 p = 0.020).</p><p>To understand the nature of the value x age interaction, we ran a post-hoc Pearson correlation between age and (1) the proportion of times a $5 stimulus was chosen, and (2) the proportion of times that a $0 stimulus was chosen. Age was not associated with choice of the $5 stimulus (r = 0.001; p = 0.992; n = 210), but it was associated with choice of the $0 stimulus (r = 0.38; p &lt; 0.001; n = 210), such that older adults were more likely to choose to interact with low-value stimuli. In other words, older adults' maladaptive decision-making was driven by their tendency to approach lowvalue stimuli, rather than their avoidance of high-value stimuli.</p><p>To interpret the value x memory level x age interaction, we ran a series of posthoc Pearson correlations, relating age to choices about stimuli in each of the six relevant bins (i.e., confident correct -high and low value, confident incorrect -high and low value, and item memory only -high and low value). After Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, we found that age was significantly associated with an increased tendency to select low-value stimuli, both when participants had confident correct associative memory (r = 0.37; p &lt; 0.001; n = 199), and when associative memory responses were guesses (r = 0.20; p = 0.006; n = 197). When deciding about low-value stimuli for which participants had confident incorrect associative memory (i.e., when they thought the $0 stimuli were actually worth $5), there was no relationship between age and choice (r = 0.04; p = 0.566; n = 198). Age was also not associated with the tendency to select high-value ($5) stimuli, whether associative memory was confident and incorrect (r = 0.11; p = 0.140; n = 199), participants were guessing about associative memory (r = 0.02; p = 0.773; n = 190), or associative memory was confident and correct (r = -0.17; p = 0.014; n = 202). Therefore, older adults' impairment in memory-guided decision-making was driven by a maladaptive tendency to approach low-value ($0) stimuli even when they accurately remembered that a stimulus was lowvalue. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1</ref>. Age affected the ability to use associative memory to make adaptive decisions, with older adults being less likely to avoid low-value stimuli that they either had no associative memory for (a) or that they had confident and correct associative memory for (b). **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.</p><p>Additional ANCOVA results (Social vs. non-social decision-making). When considering the whole sample, participants did not choose faces more than houses (t174 = 0.63; ptukey = 0.532). They also did not avoid $0 faces more than $0 houses (t174 = 12.12; ptukey = 0.151), and they did not approach $5 faces more than $5 houses (t174 = 1.60; ptukey = 0.382). There was a main effect of stimulus type in the model (F(1,174) = 8.59; p = 0.004; η 2 p = 0.047), but this was qualified by a stimulus type x age interaction (F(1,174) = 8.69; p = 0.004; η 2 p = 0.048), described in the main text. There was also a significant remembered value x age interaction (F(1,174) = 23.71; p &lt; 0.001; η 2 p = 0.120).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Post-hoc correlations with age (Social vs. non-social decision-making).</head><p>As stated in the main text, there was a significant correlation between age and the tendency to choose faces remembered as being unfair (r = 0.40; p &lt; 0.001; n = 199), but this did not extend to choices about low-value houses (r = 0.04; p = 0.558; n = 187). Not only is this effect of aging on choice specific to the social domain, but it is also specific to the lowvalue stimuli. The association between age and the tendency to choose stimuli remembered as high-value was negative, and only borderline significant in the nonsocial domain (r = -0.18; p = 0.012; n = 193) and trending toward significance in the social domain (r = -0.13; p = 0.067; n = 201). Thus, it was not the case that older adults were more likely to select unfair others just because they were more likely to select the stimulus over the schematic image in general.</p><p>Associations between perceived generosity and other ratings. The "perceived generosity" rating was correlated with the other ratings, such that faces perceived as more competent (ρ = 0.49; p = 0.004), warm (ρ = 0.89; p &lt; 0.001), and trustworthy (ρ = 0.88; p &lt; 0.001) were perceived as having shared more money in the Dictator game.</p><p>Perceived dominance (ρ = -0.18; p = 0.328) and attractiveness (ρ = 0.28; p = 0.124)</p><p>were not associated with perceived generosity.</p><p>Effects of facial appearance on choice are independent of associative memory deficits. If people rely on facial appearance more in their choices because they are compensating for their memory decline, then we might expect to find a significant correlation between associative memory accuracy (d') and the random-effects slopes on these facial attributes, even after controlling for age. This was not the case: perceived generosity partial r = -0.04; p = 0.569; trustworthiness partial r = -0.05; p = 0.470; warmth partial r = -0.06; p = 0.419; competence partial r = -0.06; p = 0.395; attractiveness partial r = -0.08; p = 0.262.</p><p>However, there was a significant negative relationship between associative memory response bias and the reliance on facial features in choice, even after controlling for age (perceived generosity partial r = -0.29; p &lt; 0.001; trustworthiness partial r = -0.28; p &lt; 0.001; warmth partial r = -0.26; p &lt; 0.001; competence partial r = -0.26; p &lt; 0.001; attractiveness partial r = -0.16; p = 0.021), such that those individuals who were more biased toward remembering that partners were generous were also those who engaged more with trustworthy-looking partners. Thus, after accounting for their memory deficits, older adults were not only more likely to remember that people were generous, but they were also more likely to engage with people who appeared generous, despite the fact that these appearances were unrelated to their actual behavior.</p><p>Effects of face stimulus age, gender, and race on choice. As stated in the main text, there were significant effects of stimulus age (b = -0.020; p = 0.001), gender (b = 0.448; p &lt; 0.001), and race on choice. With respect to race, Black partners were more likely to be chosen relative to White partners (b = 0.331; p &lt; 0.001), while there was no difference between Asian and White partners (b = 0.061; p = 0.487). A follow-up regression with Asian race as the reference level revealed that Black partners were also more likely to be selected compared to Asian partners (b = 0.265; p = 0.003). <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table S1</ref> summarizes these effects and also shows the extent to which they were correlated with the age of the participant. While the effects of participant age were small, they are consistent with older adults relying on irrelevant facial features more in their decisions: they were even more likely to choose female faces and Black faces. For the stimulus age effects, however, the positive sign of the correlation coefficient suggests that older adults were less likely than young adults to choose younger-looking faces. Since all of the faces shown were of young adults, however, thus restricting the stimulus age range tested, this finding should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Notably, there were no effects of stimulus race (F(2,29) = 1.14; p = 0.333) or age (r = 0.03; p = 0.879; n = 32) on perceived generosity, but female faces were perceived as more generous than male faces (t30 = 2.47; p = 0.019). A follow-up regression that included perceived generosity as an additional covariate found that female stimuli were still more likely to be selected than male stimuli even after accounting for variance Contributors to social avoidance decisions. We ran a multiple linear regression examining the effects of both normative (item and associative memory accuracy) and non-normative (social memory and decision biases) influences on decisions to avoid social partners who were previously unfair. The two strongest predictors of social avoidance behavior were social associative memory response bias (standardized b = 0.41; p &lt; 0.001) and the tendency to approach others remembered as being unfair (standardized b = -0.43; p &lt; 0.001). In other words, both the tendency toward remembering others as being fair and the inclination toward approaching partners that were remembered as being unfair had large and approximately equal impacts on the successful avoidance of unfair others. The next strongest predictor was associative memory accuracy (standardized b = 0.20; p &lt; 0.001). After controlling for those variables, neither item memory accuracy (standardized b = 0.07; p = 0.177) nor the influence of perceived generosity (b = -0.07; p = 0.151) had a significant effect on avoidance choices. These data tentatively suggest that interventions targeting social motivations are likely to be the most effective at improving older adults' decisions to avoid social partners who were previously unfair.</p><p>Control experiment: Assessing memory prior to decision-making does not alter the effects of associative memory on choice. In our main experiment, the Decision task was given prior to the Memory task so that each subject saw each stimulus only once prior to deciding whether or not to interact with that stimulus in the Decision phase.</p><p>However, this ordering introduces the possibility that participants would give memory responses that were in line with their previous decisions, even if they did not have intact associative memory. If that were the case, then the effects of associative memory on decision-making might be unduly amplified by a bias in memory reporting.</p><p>To address this potential issue, we ran a control experiment online via Amazon's mechanical Turk. Seventy-nine adults aged 55+ (mean age = 61.14; SD = 6.79; 62 F, 17 M; race: 68 White non-Hispanic, 3 White Hispanic, 6 Black non-Hispanic, 2 Asian non-Hispanic) performed the study, but six were excluded (see Exclusion Criteria in SI Appendix), yielding 73 total participants. In this control experiment, the Decision phase was split into two blocks (48 trials each) -one that came prior to the Memory task and one that followed the Memory task. This allowed us to ensure that the effects of associative memory on decision-making were similar whether the decisions were made before or after the memory test. We performed the same ANOVA described in the main text, with memory level (Confident incorrect associative memory / Item memory only / Confident correct associative memory) and value ($5 / $0) as factors predicting choice, but we added in a third within-subjects factor: Decision block (Before Memory Test / After Memory Test). As expected, there was a significant main effect of Value on choice (F(1,19) = 45.45; p &lt; 0.001; η 2 p = 0.705), with people choosing high-value stimuli more than low-value stimuli overall. There was also a significant Memory level x Value interaction (F(2,38) = 38.20; p &lt; 0.001; η 2 p = 0.668), such that associative memory for the item and its value was necessary for approaching high-value stimuli and avoiding lowvalue stimuli. Critically, however, the results were not at all modulated by when decisions about the stimuli were made. There was no significant three-way (Memory level x Value x Decision block) interaction (F(2,38) = 1.98; p = 0.152; η 2 p = 0.094) on choice; nor were there any two-way interactions with Decision block (Decision block x Memory level: F(2,38) = 1.48; p = 0.240; η 2 p = 0.072; Decision block x Value: F(2,38) = 0.22; p = 0.648; η 2 p = 0.011), or a main effect of Decision block (F(1,19) = 0.88; p = 0.359; η 2 p = 0.044) on choice.</p><p>We therefore concluded that the finding that associative memory is necessary for adaptive decision-making is not just driven by participants responding to Memory questions in a way that was consistent with their behavior in the Decision task. These results should be interpreted with caution, however, as only twenty participants had data in all twelve bins for this analysis.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Task Layout.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_6"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Methods Participant recruitment. Two hundred and twenty-three participants (121 White non-Hispanic, 10 White Hispanic, 34 Asian non-Hispanic, 21 Black non-Hispanic, 1 Black Hispanic, 5 Other race non-Hispanic, 6 Other race Hispanic, 4 mixed race, 21 not reported) completed the study, with 210 included in the final sample (see Exclusion criteria in SI Appendix). All participants provided informed consent, and all procedures were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania. Efforts were made to recruit roughly equal numbers of participants in three age bins: young (18-34), middle-aged (35-59), and older adults (60+). Cognitively normal older adults were recruited primarily from the Clinical Core of Penn's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC; n = 46 in final sample from this group). These participants are part of a longitudinal cohort in which they undergo neuropsychological assessments and consensus conference designation to assess their cognitive status annually. All other participants were recruited through advertisements on Penn's campus (n = 111), or advertising on Facebook (n = 53). Participants recruited outside of the cohort reported that they were free of cognitive impairment, but we also collected the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) from all participants who were outside the cohort. Participants from the ADRC cohort already had WTAR scores available. While this test does not capture cognitive decline, it allowed us to test whether the age groups were matched on general intelligence.Stimuli. For information about how stimuli (photographs of previous participants and houses) were selected, see SI Appendix.</figDesc></figure>

Age did not significantly modulate either of these effects (age x reward status: F(1,206) = 3.12; p = 0.079; η 2 p = 0.015; age x reward status x stimulus type: F(1,206) = 0.59; p = 0.442; η 2 p = 0.003). Therefore, there is no evidence that older adults were paying less attention to reward outcomes in the Reward phase or that their self-reported reactions to monetary outcomes were different from those of younger adults. Item and associative memory performance were above chance in all groups. In all three age groups, and for both faces and houses, item memory (d') was above chance (young adults: houses, M = 2.27; SD = 0.85; t75 = 23.4; p &lt; 0.001; faces, M = 2.88; SD = 0.77; t75 = 32.6; p &lt; 0.001; middle-aged adults: houses, M = 2.19; SD = 0.77; t69 = 23.7; p &lt; 0.001; faces, M = 2.66; SD = 0.73; t69 = 32.6; p &lt; 0.001; older adults: houses, M = 1.67; SD = 0.79; t63 = 16.9; p &lt; 0.001; faces, M = 1.95; SD = 0.97; t63 = 16.1; p &lt; 0.001).</figDesc></figure>
