<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identifying Resource-Rational Heuristics for Risky Choice</head><p>We make thousands of decisions every day. Collectively, these decisions determine our personal lives and the success of companies and organizations, and they also shape the economy and society as a whole. However, making good decisions is a challenging computational problem for people and artificial intelligences alike <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Bossaerts &amp; Murawski, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Bossaerts et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Gershman et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">Kwisthout et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b108">Nowozin, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Papadimitriou &amp; Tsitsiklis, 1986)</ref>. According to classic economic theory, people should choose their actions so as to maximize the expected value of the consequences <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Morgenstern &amp; Von Neumann, 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b128">Savage, 1951)</ref>, but computing those expected values for real-world problems is a substantial task and humans face significant limitations in computational resources and time <ref type="bibr" target="#b137">(Simon, 1972)</ref>. As a result, most real-world decisions are too complex for people to apply those economic principles correctly. Instead, people have to rely on heuristics to simplify decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Gardner, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Gilovich et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Kahneman et al., 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Maule &amp; Hodgkinson, 2002)</ref>.</p><p>Despite the ubiquity of heuristics (and resulting biases) in decision-making, identifying which heuristics people use and when they use them can be a challenge.</p><p>Psychologists identify heuristics by thinking about the structure of decision environments and observing human behavior, but this process of discovery is slow and requires both luck and ingenuity. This makes discovering good heuristics a critical bottleneck to understanding and improving human decision-making. Furthermore, while many specific heuristics have been identified, there is no general method that could be used to predict which heuristics will be used in novel situations.</p><p>In this article, we address these problems by proposing a theoretical framework that can be used to automatically derive optimal heuristics. This approach relies on the idea that people's heuristics may arise as a rational adaptation to the structure of the environment and the cognitive constraints of limited time and computational resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Frank, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Griffiths et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Griffiths et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Lewis et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Simon, 1956</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b137">Simon, , 1972</ref><ref type="bibr">Zednik &amp; Jäkel, 2016</ref>) -a normative benchmark that we refer to as "resource rationality" <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Griffiths et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Resource rationality is achieved through an optimal trade-off between decision quality and computational cost. This trade-off also arises in machines, and can be formalized using ideas from the artificial intelligence literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b125">(Russell &amp; Wefald, 1991b)</ref>. Specifically, heuristic decision-making can itself be understood as a sequential decision problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Griffiths et al., 2019)</ref>. At each step, people make a decision about whether to collect more information about their options through deliberation, or simply to stop thinking and act.</p><p>Whereas classic rationality applies to the utility of decisions in the external world, and research on heuristics and biases highlights internal cognitive limitations, the framework we propose here bridges these two approaches by viewing rationality as a property of this internal sequential decision process, rather than of the resulting external decisions. We leverage recent advances in machine learning to solve this sequential decision problem, allowing us to automatically derive optimal heuristics for any decision environment.</p><p>To demonstrate the accuracy and generalizability of our approach, we applied it to multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision-making <ref type="bibr">(Zanakis et al., 1998)</ref>. The heuristics people use to make these kinds of decisions have been extensively studied in the Mouselab paradigm for multi-alternative risky choice, where participants choose between multiple gambles whose payoffs depend on a random outcome <ref type="bibr">(Payne et al., 1988, Figure 1)</ref>.</p><p>Participants are shown the probability of each outcome and a payoff matrix with one column for each gamble and one row for each outcome. The entry in column g and row o indicates how much money gamble g pays if the outcome o occurs. Critically, all payoffs are initially occluded, and the player can reveal outcomes by clicking on them one-by-one.</p><p>Thus, the sequence of clicks a player makes traces their decision strategy. To operationalize the cost of gathering information, participants are charged a fixed fee for every click; thus, to maximize earnings, the player must employ a decision strategy that achieves an optimal trade-off between the cost of information gathering versus the value of information.</p><p>Click #2 Click #3 Click #1 Click #4</p><p>Prob. in %</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 1</head><p>Illustration of the Mouselab paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Payne et al., 1988)</ref>. The task is to choose one of six gambles, each of which results in one of four probabilistic outcomes; before gambling, participants can gather information about the value of each cell by clicking on it. The Mouselab paradigm externalizes computations by clicks, belief states by revealed information, and the cost of each computation by the fee charged for the corresponding click. This example shows a sequence of clicks generated by the Satisficing-Take-The-Best strategy, which was discovered through our approach.</p><p>We applied our heuristic-discovery method across a large range of multi-attribute decision-making problems and tested its predictions in an experiment that is an order of magnitude larger than the largest previous study in this setting. Our method automatically rediscovered the classic Take-The-Best  and</p><p>Weighted-Additive <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Dawes &amp; Corrigan, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al., 1988)</ref> heuristics as resource-rational strategies in specific situations, validating the approach. In addition, our method discovered novel heuristics that had been previously overlooked. We collected data from over 2,300 participants, systematically varying the parameters of the decision-making environment. This allowed us to parametrically evaluate human heuristics using the normative standard of resource-rationality. If human heuristics are selected in accordance with this normative standard, people should adapt their strategies to the decision environment.</p><p>Our approach correctly predicted which strategies people use and under which environmental conditions they use them more versus less often. Comparing people's strategy choices against the normative standard of resource rationality indicated that people use resource-rational decision-making strategies, and adaptively select which strategy to use based on the structure of the environment. However, they select and execute these strategies imperfectly, thus falling short of perfect resource-rational decision-making. In a follow-up experiment, we found that people continued to deviate from resource-rational decision-making even when the task was modified such that the assumptions of the resource-rational model were met. Our findings suggest that our automatic strategy discovery method is a promising approach for uncovering people's cognitive strategies and assessing human rationality using a more realistic normative standard.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>Before we introduce our approach, we briefly summarize previous work on identifying the heuristics that people use in multi-alternative risky choice, and the normative frameworks that have been used to account for these choices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manually identified heuristics</head><p>Previous work has manually identified a number of heuristics employed in multi-attribute risky choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Gigerenzer &amp; Goldstein, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Katsikopoulos, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Payne, 1976a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Simon, 1956;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b147">Thorngate, 1980)</ref>. Early research focused on additive models in which linear combinations of payoffs are used to make a decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Dawes &amp; Corrigan, 1974;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Einhorn &amp; Hogarth, 1975)</ref>. For example, classical expected utility theory is implemented by the Weighted Additive model, in which payoffs are weighted by their probabilities. 1</p><p>Another widely-recognized heuristic is the lexicographic rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b146">(Svenson, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Tversky, 1969)</ref> or "Take-The-Best" , which focuses on a single <ref type="bibr">1</ref> The traditional notion of expected value maximization under risky choice can be traced all the way to the foundations of probability theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Huygens, 1657</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Huygens, , 1714</ref>, while the idea that people instead use subjective utility began with <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bernoulli (1738</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bernoulli ( , 1954</ref>. Modern research using weighted additive models of utility applied to risky decision-making began with Von Neumann and <ref type="bibr">Morgenstern (1944)</ref>, while <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al. (1988)</ref> were the first to apply this benchmark to the Mouselab task. For a discussion of the origins of early research on models of risky decision-making, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Edwards (1954)</ref>. diagnostic attribute. Satisficing, on the other hand, focuses on one alternative at a time, selecting it only if all of its attributes are above a certain cutoff value <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Simon, 1956)</ref>.</p><p>Like researchers before them, <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al. (1988)</ref> studied the trade-off between cognitive effort and decision accuracy afforded by heuristics. They operationalized effort by decomposing heuristics into units of "elementary information processes" (EIPs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Johnson &amp; Payne, 1985)</ref>. These basic steps of cognitive processing include operations like "read," "compare," "add," "product," "move," and "choose," and this framework has its origins in the view of human reasoners as symbolic information processing systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">(Newell, Simon, et al., 1972)</ref>. Assuming every operation requires equal effort, <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al. (1988)</ref> reported simulation results showing the effort-accuracy trade-off of nine different heuristics in the Mouselab task. These heuristics included the three aforementioned, two others ("elimination by aspects" <ref type="bibr" target="#b149">(Tversky, 1972)</ref> and "majority confirming dimensions" <ref type="bibr" target="#b126">(Russo &amp; Dosher, 1983)</ref>), and four hybrids or modified versions of the previous five. They showed that certain heuristics require substantially less effort but that, depending on the environment of the Mousleab task, may incur only a minimal reduction in accuracy. For example, when one attribute is much more likely than all the others, Take-The-Best performs nearly as well as the much more costly Weighted Additive strategy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al. (1988)</ref> noted general characteristics in the patterns of information processing associated with heuristics. These include the amount of information gathered and the variance in gathering information across attributes vs. across alternatives. Rather than measure heuristics directly, they measured these behavioral features in human participants, which we discuss in detail later. They found that people adjust their information processing to the environment, such that less effortful patterns are used when the reduction in accuracy is relatively small, and when under time constraints (since less effortful heuristics are simpler and faster).</p><p>While appreciating the effort-accuracy trade-off, <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al. (1988)</ref> assume that expected value maximization is the normative standard, and that heuristics arise as a necessary but suboptimal adaptation to environmental variables. That is, certain heuristics are less bad in some environments, but a limitation all the same. Their simulation results cannot predict which heuristic ought to be used in which environment because EIPs do not specify how much effort each operation costs. Rather, the subjective cost of even a single EIP is ultimately a suboptimal cognitive bias. In our work, rather than assume EIPs that have a priori unquantifiable cost, we externalize the cognitive cost of gathering information directly, which allows us to compute precisely the optimal trade-off between effort (operationalized as click costs) and decision accuracy. This provides a normative account of heuristics based on the rational use of costly cognitive operations. In this framework, heuristics can be derived automatically by optimizing the cost-accuracy trade-off, rather than relying on subjective insight to propose or search for strategies.</p></div>

While challenging classic rationality, this work generally views heuristics as adaptive to the environment rather than adaptive to inherent constraints on the decision-making process itself.</p><p>Researchers have previously considered the ideal observer perspective for rational decision-makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Fishburn, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Geisler, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Howard, 1968)</ref>, but such an approach was recognized as infeasible <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bell et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Kimball, 1958;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">Simon, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b150">Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974)</ref>.

Expressing heuristics as a rational trade-off between expected payoff and cognitive cost makes it possible to use methods from machine learning to find a near-optimal policy for selecting which costly cognitive operation to perform next given the result of previous operations. In addition to uncovering new heuristics, this approach can establish a normative basis for heuristics that people are already known to use. Any heuristic that our method identifies is likely to strike a near-optimal trade-off between cognitive cost and decision quality.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Automatically deriving resource-rational heuristics</head><p>Our approach rests on the key insight that the process of making a decision can itself be described as a sequential decision problem. At each step of this problem, the agent chooses whether to perform some computation or to instead take the results of previous computations and act. Stated in these terms, the problem of making a decision can be recognized as a Markov Decision Process (MDP; see <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). A decision-making strategy (a heuristic) is then a policy for that MDP, that is, a function that selects which computation to execute next given the results of previous computations. In the artificial intelligence literature, this problem of choosing a sequence of computations to perform has been formalized as a "meta-level" MDP <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hay et al., 2012)</ref>, where the name acknowledges that we are deciding how to decide.</p><p>The definition of a meta-level MDP parallels that of a conventional, or "object-level" <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">(Russell &amp; Wefald, 1991a)</ref>, MDP. In an object-level MDP, the environment is represented using states that the agent can occupy, and actions that the agent can execute, which lead to rewards and transitions to new states. The agent's objective is to select actions that maximize cumulative reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b145">(Sutton &amp; Barto, 2018)</ref>. The reinforcement learning paradigm relies on the MDP framework as a formal representation of the external environment and has led to considerable recent advances in artificial intelligence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Berner et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Hessel et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Mnih et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b135">Silver et al., 2017)</ref> and success in describing human (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Cohen &amp; Ranganath, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Shteingart &amp; Loewenstein, 2014)</ref> and animal (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b120">Rescorla, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b144">Sutton &amp; Barto, 1990)</ref> behavior and brain function (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Botvinick et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Dayan &amp; Daw, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Glimcher, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Ludvig et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Niv, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b130">Schultz et al., 1997)</ref>.</p><p>A meta-level MDP uses the same formal framework, but instead of capturing the external environment in which decisions take place it represents the internal environment of the cognitive processes that underlie those decisions. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, internal states are referred to as beliefs, b, and internal actions are described as computations, c, that can be used to update beliefs. Because brains and machines have limited computational resources, computations come with a cost, r meta . In addition to making internal computations, an agent can execute a special internal action, ⊥, that terminates deliberation and takes the action in the external world with the highest expected value according to their current beliefs. The agent then receives a reward from the external world (blue nodes in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>). To identify the best policy for the meta-MDP, we use methods from reinforcement learning that are used to solve MDPs. This provides a normative account of how a decision-maker ought to navigate the internal world of their mind. In this way, a meta-level MDP can be used to derive cognitive strategies for decision-making.</p><p>The meta-level MDP has its origins in the artificial intelligence literature on rational metareasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hay et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Russell &amp; Wefald, 1991b)</ref>, which is concerned with building machines that best use their limited computational resources. Recently, however, the approach has been applied to understand how humans efficiently use their cognitive resources. In particular, meta-level MDPs have been used to build resource-rational models of simple (non multi-attribute) decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Callaway, Rangel, et al., 2021)</ref> as well as planning <ref type="bibr">Callaway, van Opheusden, et al., 2021)</ref>. Here, we apply this approach to compute resource-rational heuristics for multi-attribute risky choice and compare them to the strategies that people use. Our approach builds on previous work modeling heuristics in decision-making in terms of elementary information processes (detailed above; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bettman et al., 1990</ref>; Johnson</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>Schematic illustration of the meta-level Markov Decision Process framework applied to the Mouselab task. At the beginning of each trial, when all cell values are hidden, the agent's initial belief state, b 0 , is represented as Gaussian distribution for each of the six gambles. Each time the agent makes a computation, c, by clicking on a cell to gather information, it incurs a computational cost, r meta , and updates its belief distribution for the observed column. When the agent is finished gathering information, it can choose to terminate deliberation, ⊥, by selecting a gamble, at which point an action is taken in the external world and it receives a reward (blue nodes). <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">&amp; Payne, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al., 1988)</ref>. Like this previous work, we model the decision-making process as a sequence of simpler cognitive operations. However, unlike previous work, we do not manually specify how the operations should be sequenced; instead, we derive optimal sequences automatically. That is, we pose the sequencing problem as a meta-MDP and identify a near-optimal policy that chooses which operation to perform next given the outcome of previous operations. This allows us to exhaustively explore the space of heuristics, identifying those that are adaptive in specific circumstances, rather than relying on human creativity to generate hypotheses about the heuristics people might follow.</p><p>Solving complex meta-level MDPs is a challenging computational problem whose complexity exceeds the capacities of standard methods from reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. To overcome this challenge, we recently developed a new reinforcement learning algorithm that is specifically tailored to solving meta-level MDPs called Bayesian meta-level policy search (BMPS) . Here, we use this technical advance to discover rational heuristics for risky choice. The resulting approach is as follows: First, we model the distribution of decision problems posed by the environment and the cognitive capacities the decision-maker has available to solve those problems as a meta-level MDP. Next, we apply BMPS to solve the meta-level MDP.</p><p>Finally, we characterize this solution in terms of discrete decision strategies by applying a clustering algorithm to the cognitive operations it performs to make its decisions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Automatically discovering strategies for Mouselab</head><p>We set out to discover resource-rational heuristics by applying our automatic strategy discovery method to the Mouselab task, the classic process-tracing paradigm for multi-attribute risky choice described above. In the experimental task (illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), participants must select from a set of six gambles with four possible outcomes.</p><p>To reveal the value of a given gamble under a given outcome, participants must click the corresponding cell in a table, paying a cost for doing so. As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>, we model this task as a meta-level MDP in which the belief state captures a posterior over the value of each gamble given the currently revealed values, and computations correspond to revealing a cell and updating the posterior accordingly. Solving this meta-MDP yields a decision-making policy that optimally trades-off between the costs and benefits of considering additional information.</p><p>The following sections explain how we modeled the problem of meta-decision-making in the Mouselab paradigm as a meta-level MDP, how we solved this problem to identify optimal strategies, and how we characterized the resulting solutions in terms of simple heuristics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Mouselab paradigm</head><p>In our version of the Mouselab paradigm, the alternatives are gambles and the attributes of each gamble are its payoffs in the event of different outcomes. The Mouselab paradigm traces people's decision process by recording the order in which they inspect different pieces of information. Concretely, participants are presented with a payoff matrix where the columns correspond to the alternatives they are choosing between and the rows correspond to different outcomes. Each cell in the payoff matrix specifies how much the alternative corresponding to its column would pay (in points, which translate to a monetary payoff) if the event corresponding to its row were to occur. Critically, all the payoffs are initially occluded, and the participant has to click on a cell to reveal its entry.</p><p>The probabilities of the different outcomes are known to the participant. Each click comes at a cost, and participants are free to inspect as many or as few cells as they would like.</p><p>The resource-rational model makes strong predictions about how the structure of the environment affects the heuristics people should use. To test these predictions in a systematic and comprehensive way, we considered a wide variety of decision environments that varied across three parameters: 1) the "stakes" of the decision (the variance of possible payoffs), 2) the "dispersion" of the outcome distribution (lower values resulting in more similar probabilities for each outcome), and 3) the "cost" of computation (the number of points subtracted for each click). We considered two levels of stakes and five levels for dispersion and for cost, resulting in a total of 50 conditions. Each environment was generated by sampling from a distribution specified by the corresponding condition.</p><p>The two levels of stakes determined the distribution of payoffs, with lower variation in points for low stakes, and higher variation in points for high stakes (points drawn from N (0, σ 2 ) where σ ∈ {75, 150}). The five levels of dispersion determined the outcome probabilities, with all outcomes being roughly equally likely for low dispersion, and one outcome being much more likely than others for high dispersion (outcome probabilities drawn from Dirichlet(α • 1) where α ∈ {10 −1.0 , 10 −0.5 , 10 0.0 , 10 0.5 , 10 1.0 }). The cost of collecting information was defined by the number of points subtracted for each click (λ ∈ {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Meta-level MDP model</head><p>Before defining our meta-level MDP model, we briefly review generic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs; <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Puterman, 2014)</ref>. MDPs are the standard formalism for modeling sequential decision problems, in which an agent iteratively interacts with an environment to attain the largest possible sum of rewards. An (undiscounted) MDP is defined by a four-tuple, M = S, A, T, r, where S is a set of possible environment states, A is a set of actions that an agent can take, T is a transition function that gives the probability of moving from state s ∈ S to state s ′ conditioned on taking action a ∈ A: In addition to making computations, at any time, t, the meta-level agent can choose to terminate deliberation by taking action ⊥, at which point the meta-level reward function, r meta , describes the reward the agent will receive for taking the object-level (that is, external) action that has highest expected utility given the current belief; thus</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">T (s, a, s ′ ),</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">r meta (b, ⊥) = max a E s∼b [U (s, a)]</formula><p>where U is the external utility function. The meta-level agent's objective is to learn a meta-level policy, π meta , that maximizes the trade-off between decision quality, r meta (b, ⊥), and accumulated computation costs, t • λ, where t is the number of computations executed before termination and λ is the cost of each computation.</p><p>We model optimal heuristics for risky choice in the Mouselab paradigm as solutions to the meta-level MDP M Mouselab = (B, C, T meta , r meta ). Concretely, we characterize the decision-maker's belief state at time t by a set indicating which payoffs have already been observed and processed (O t ) and probability distributions (b t,1 , • • • , b t,n ) over the expected utilities of the available gambles, each of which is defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">E[U (g)] = o p(o)v o,g<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where v o,g is the payoff of the gamble g under outcome o (V is the payoff matrix). For each payoff, there is one computation c o,g that inspects the payoff v o,g and updates the agent's belief about the expected value of the inspected gamble according to Bayesian inference.</p><p>Since the entries of the payoff matrix are drawn from the Gaussian distribution</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">N (v, σ 2 v ),</formula><p>the resulting posterior distributions are also Gaussian. Hence, the decision-maker's belief about the expected payoff of the g th gamble is represented by</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">b t,g = b (µ) t,g , b (σ 2 ) t,g ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where b</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">(µ) t,g and b (σ 2 )</formula><p>t,g are the mean and the variance of the probability distribution on the expected value of gamble g given the belief state b t . Given the set <ref type="bibr">(t)</ref> )} of the indices of the t observations made so far, the means and variances characterizing the decision-maker's beliefs are given by</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">O t = {(o (1) , g (1) ), • • • , (o (t) , g</formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">b (µ) t,g = o p(o) •          v o,g if (o, g) ∈ Ō v otherwise (3) b (σ 2 ) t,g = o p(o) 2 •          0 if (o, g) ∈ O σ 2 v otherwise.<label>(4)</label></formula><p>That is, the belief about each gamble's value is a Gaussian whose mean is the expected value of the gamble (with unobserved payoffs replaced by the average) and whose variance is the probability-weighted sum of the variance induced by each unobserved payoff.</p><p>The meta-level transition function T meta (b t , c o,g , b t+1 ) encodes the probability distribution on what the updated means and variances will be given the observation of a</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">payoff value v o,g sampled from N (v, σ 2 v )</formula><p>, and is determined using Bayesian inference integrating over the distribution of possible observed payoff values. The meta-level reward for performing the computation c o,g ∈ C encodes that acquiring and processing an additional piece of information is costly. We assume that the cost of all such computations is a constant λ. The meta-level reward for terminating deliberation and taking action is</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">r meta (b t , ⊥) = max g b (µ)</formula><p>t (g), since the agent will choose the action with the gamble with the highest expected value.</p><p>Using this formalism, we can define a resource-rational heuristic h ⋆ as the optimal policy for a meta-level MDP. The optimal meta-level policy is the one that maximizes the meta-level reward for making a decision in an well-informed belief state minus the cost of attaining it, that is</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">h ⋆ = arg max πmeta E t r meta (b t , π meta (b t )) (5) = arg max πmeta E max g b (µ) t ⊥ (g) − t ⊥ • λ ,<label>(6)</label></formula><p>where the random variable t ⊥ is the time step in which the meta-level policy terminates deliberation and λ is the cost of a single computation. Having redefined resource-rational heuristics in this way now allows us to discover them by solving meta-level MDPs. To be able to solve complex meta-level MDPs, we recently developed the Bayesian meta-level policy search algorithm . In Appendix A we provide details of how this algorithm can be applied to find near-optimal strategies in this model.  A similar analysis was conducted on the optimal heuristics identified by our model for the corresponding scenarios. (B) Centroids for the clusters uncovered in human data and model simulations from Experiment 1. The first two clusters correspond to previously identified strategies: Take-The-Best (TTB) and Weighted Additive (WADD), respectively. The third and fourth clusters correspond to the newly discovered strategies: Satisficing-TTB (SAT-TTB) and SAT-TTB+. A fifth cluster corresponding to gambling randomly (without gathering information) was also revealed in the human data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of resource-rational heuristics</head><p>As discussed above, previous work has identified a set of well-known heuristics that people use in multi-attribute risky choice. For example, Take-the-Best (TTB) chooses between alternative options based on the one single attribute that is the best predictor of the outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Gigerenzer &amp; Goldstein, 1996)</ref>. 2 Another heuristic, Satisficing (SAT), considers alternative options until it finds one that is good enough <ref type="bibr" target="#b136">(Simon, 1956)</ref>; it is sometimes referred to as a conjuctive rule. These heuristics both ignore information about some alternatives or attributes. In contrast, a less frugal strategy, Weighted Additive (WADD), considers all the available information and computes the expected payoffs of all alternatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b136">Simon, 1956)</ref>. It remains unknown, however, whether additional heuristics exist. Here we set out to discover new heuristics by exploring the full space of potential heuristics encompassed by all the wide range of decision environments we considered.</p><p>We found the best strategy for each of 1000 distinct Mouselab problems, corresponding to 20 random samples of payoff matrices in each of the 50 conditions outlined above. To explore this space in a data-driven way, we applied the k-means clustering algorithm to the sequences of actions ("clicks") performed by our resource-rational model. k-means clustering partitions the click sequences into k discrete clusters of similar sequences, with the centroid of each cluster showing the prototype click sequence for that cluster. These prototypes highlight distinct types of heuristics deployed in the Mouselab task.</p><p>Prior to applying clustering, we transformed the click sequences into a standard format as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A</ref>. The following steps were performed to reduce uninformative spatial variation across trials in the locations of clicks. First, for each problem, a 4 × 6 indicator matrix of click locations in the Mouselab grid was generated. Second, for each column, the sum of outcome probabilities for every observed cell was computed. Finally, we performed the following transformation on the indicator matrix: rows (outcomes) were rearranged from the most to the least probable outcome, and columns (gambles) were rearranged in descending order of the sum of the probabilities of the outcomes observed in that column. This transformed binary matrix from each trial was collapsed into a vector of length 24 (representing click locations but not the temporal sequence of clicks), which comprised a sample for k-means clustering.</p><p>We applied the Elkan k-means clustering algorithm to the locations of clicks predicted by our resource-rational model across all 1000 problems, with a Euclidean distance metric <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Elkan, 2003)</ref>. In this and all subsequent analyses, the distribution of the 1000 problems used to measure the model's behavior was exactly proportional to the particular distribution of those trials received by all participants, to remove variance from model-participant comparisons. Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was used to project the 24-dimensional click sequence vectors onto a 2-dimensional space <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Fisher, 1936)</ref>. We selected k = 4 clusters because this identified unique types of click patterns; k &gt; 4 resulted in redundant clusters (see <ref type="figure">Figure B2</ref> for a comparison of different values of k), which could be due to a limit in the number of strategies people use, or a limitation of the clustering method. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref> (top) shows the centroids identified in the resource-rational click sequences. Inspecting the prototypes for the resource-rational model in centroids 1 and 2 revealed that our method rediscovered the TTB heuristic  and the WADD strategy, respectively. This indicates that these heuristics strike a near-optimal trade-off between decision quality and cognitive cost, at least in some situations. TTB corresponds to inspecting only the most probable attribute for each alternative gamble. The WADD strategy clicks practically everywhere, hence the nearly all-yellow color. Rediscovering these classic heuristics provides support for the validity of our approach.</p><p>Centroids 3 and 4 correspond to the prototypes of two newly discovered strategies.</p><p>The first, which we call SAT-TTB, combines elements of TTB and Satisficing (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>), and may be likened to a single-dimension conjunctive rule. Like TTB, SAT-TTB inspects only the payoffs for the most probable outcome. But unlike TTB and like Satisficing, SAT-TTB terminates as soon as it finds a gamble whose payoff for the most probable outcome is high enough, reducing the amount of information considered. The second newly discovered heuristic, SAT-TTB+, starts by inspecting some or all of the payoffs for the most probable outcome (as in SAT-TTB), and then inspects additional payoffs for the second-most probable outcome from one or more of the most promising gambles (examples of this strategy are shown in the sequence of clicks illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref> and in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A</ref>). This strategy is similar to a lexicographic semi-order model (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Birnbaum &amp; Gutierrez, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Manzini &amp; Mariotti, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b127">Safarzadeh &amp; Rasti-Barzoki, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b148">Tversky, 1969)</ref>. The two newly discovered heuristics do not correspond to any heuristics previously observed in Mouselab. Yet, as described below, we found that people frequently use these heuristics across the wide range of environments in which they are adaptive.</p><p>In addition to allowing us to identify these four heuristics from the optimal strategies produced by the model, our approach allows us to generate predictions about when a rational agent should choose to employ each heuristic. In particular, the 50 different conditions reflecting different combinations of stakes, dispersion, and cost result in significant variation in which heuristic the model predicts should be employed. In the remainder of the paper we compare these predictions against human behavior, allowing us to examine whether people appropriately adapt which heuristic they use and how closely they approximate resource-rational performance.</p></div>

Informed consent was obtained using a consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board at Princeton University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli and procedure</head><p>Following instructions and a comprehension check, participants performed a variation of the Mouselab task <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Payne et al., 1988)</ref>. Each of the 20 trials began with a 4 × 6 grid of occluded payoffs: six gambles to choose from (columns) and four possible outcomes (rows). The occluded value in each cell specified how much the gamble indicated by its column would pay if the outcome indicated by its row occurred. The outcome probabilities were described by the number of balls of a given color in a bin of 100 balls, from which the outcome would be drawn (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). For each trial, participants were free to inspect any number of cells before selecting a gamble. Clicking on a cell revealed its payoff, and participants were charged a fixed cost per click, depending on the condition. The value of each inspected cell remained visible onscreen for the duration of the trial. When a gamble was chosen, participants were informed about which outcome had occurred, the resulting payoff of their chosen gamble, and their net earnings (payoff minus click costs).</p><p>The experiment used a 2 × 5 × 5 between-subjects factorial design with a total of fifty conditions, corresponding to those used to generate the model predictions above. The parameters in each condition were the same as those used for model simulations. These parameters included 1) the stakes of the decision, with lower variation in points for low stakes, and higher variation in points for high stakes (points drawn from N (0, σ 2 ) where σ ∈ {75, 150}), 2) the dispersion of outcome probabilities, with one outcome being much more likely than others for low dispersion, and all outcomes being roughly equally likely for high dispersion (outcome probabilities drawn from Dirichlet(α • 1) where α ∈ {10 −1.0 , 10 −0.5 , 10 0.0 , 10 0.5 , 10 1.0 }), and 3) the cost of collecting information, defined by the number of points subtracted for each click (λ ∈ {0, 1, 2, 4, 8}). The instructions explained the task by walking the participant through the demonstration of a trial with step-by-step explanations. These explanations covered the cost of clicking, the way that their payoff was determined, the range of payoffs, how some outcomes were more likely than others, and a description of the performance bonus ($0.01 for every 5 points). Participants were given three practice trials, and after these instructions, they were given a quiz that assessed their understanding of all critical information conveyed in the instructions. The full experiment, including instructions, can be viewed at https://kcggl-expt1.netlify.app/. If a participant answered one or more questions incorrectly, they were required to re-read the instructions and retake the quiz. If they failed the quiz three times, they were not allowed to participate in the main task.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of strategies</head><p>As an initial analysis, we repeated the k-means clustering procedure we used to characterize the different strategies employed by our resource-rational mode. Data from each trial was transformed in exactly the same way as the model predictions, and the resulting representations were clustered. For human participants, using k = 5 clusters produced distinct click patterns, whereas using k &gt; 5 clusters resulted in groups of redundant strategies (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure B3</ref> for a comparison of different values of k). The results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3B</ref>.</p><p>The first four clusters recapitulate perfectly those produced by the model, manifesting the classic strategies TTB and WADD as well as the newly discovered SAT-TTB and SAT-TTB+. While the resource-rational model never gambles randomly, participants do occasionally gamble without gathering any information; this is captured in centroid 5.</p><p>Based on the clustering solution, we defined 5 distinct strategies to be considered in subsequent analyses as follows: 1) SAT-TTB+ was defined as clicking one or more cells from the most probable row, and one or more cells from one or more additional rows, but never more cells from a less probable row than from a more probable row; 2) SAT-TTB was defined as selecting 1-5 cells from the most probable row, and nothing else, with the final clicked cell having the highest payoff; 3) TTB was operationalized as selecting all 6 cells from the most probable row, and nothing else; 4) WADD was defined as selecting all 24 cells; 5) A random strategy entailed zero clicks. Finally, we considered a miscellaneous category of other strategies which were those not consistent with any of the previous five definitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of strategies across environments</head><p>The clustering results indicate that people use the same types of heuristics as the resource-rational model.

Although participants also limited their use of WADD to this case, they were more likely to use SAT-TTB+. As the cost increases from 1 to 8, the resource-rational model and participants show the same pattern for the remaining three strategies: decreasing the use of both SAT-TTB+ (B = −0.8, p &lt; 0.001) and TTB (B = −3.9, p &lt; 0.001), while increasing use of the most frugal strategy, SAT-TTB (B = −3.3, p &lt; 0.001). Figures C1 and C2 compare strategy frequencies in each of the 50 conditions, showing broad correspondence between the resource-rational model and participants. <ref type="table">Table C1</ref> summarizes post-hoc pairwise comparisons and effect sizes for the statistics reported in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Understanding variability in choice behavior</head><p>Previous research on multi-attribute risky choice has characterized people's choice behavior in the Mouselab paradigm in terms of four features <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Lohse &amp; Johnson, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Payne, 1976b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al., 1988)</ref>. The first feature is the total amount of information processed, the second measures the relative frequency of attribute-versus alternative-based information processing, and the third and fourth features measure the variance in information gathering across attributes and alternatives, respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al. (1988)</ref> used these measures to assess how participants trade-off effort and accuracy across nine hand-selected heuristics, finding that both high dispersion and time pressure lead to less information gathering, more attribute-based processing relative to alternative-based processing, and more selectivity for attributes (i.e., greater variance in information gathering across each). The resource-rational model predicts all of these effects (with click cost having a similar effect as time pressure) as well as a similar pattern when the decision stakes decrease. Here, we confirm that all these effects hold across a broad set of decision environments. However, both the resource-rational model and our participants deviate from the finding of <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al. (1988)</ref> on the effect of dispersion on alternative variance.</p><p>We first considered the total amount of information gathered (i.e., the number of clicks made). As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5A</ref>, participants adapted the amount of information gathered to the environmental structure in much the same way as the model, but they consistently gathered too little information. When the stakes increase, the potential for large gains and large losses goes up, and this merits more information gathering. Indeed, participants gathered more information as the stakes increased (a linear mixed-effects regression with random intercepts for participants revealed that the stakes significantly predicted information gathered: B = 0.57, p = 0.009). When the dispersion of outcome probabilities increases, people should gather less information, since fewer outcomes (and thus cells) are relevant to each gamble's value; participants trended in this direction (B = −0.13, p = 0.097). Finally, people reduced information gathering as it became more costly to do so (B = −1.9, p &lt; 0.001). However, across all conditions, participants made on average 4.9 fewer clicks than the resource-rational model. We explore possible explanations for this discrepancy below.</p><p>We next looked at a behavioral feature that characterizes the sequences of information gathering. Specifically, we computed a metric that measures the relative frequency of alternative-based vs. attribute-based processing. In attribute-based processing, sequential clicks are made on one row/outcome (as in TTB and SAT-TTB); this corresponds to comparing several gambles along one dimension. In alternative-based processing, sequential clicks are made on one column/gamble; this corresponds to evaluating one gamble based on multiple features. We can measure the relative frequency of alternative-based versus attribute-based processing in a given trial as the number of sequential transitions between alternative-based clicks minus the number of sequential transitions between attribute-based clicks, divided by the sum of the two terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Payne, 1976b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al., 1988)</ref>. This yields a number between −1 and +1, with positive values indicating alternative-based processing, and negative numbers indicating attribute-based processing. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 5B</ref> shows that both the model and participants rely more on attribute-based processing overall, but with the model favoring this type of processing more heavily than people. Furthermore, participants adapted their processing pattern to the environment in all of the ways predicted by the model: they used more alternative-based processing as the stakes increased (B = 0.052, p = 0.016); they used more attribute-based processing as dispersion increased (B = −0.084, p &lt; 0.001) and as cost increased (B = −0.073, p &lt; 0.001). A comparison of information gathering and alternativevs. attribute-based processing for the model and participants across each of the fifty decision environments shown in <ref type="figure">Figure D1</ref>, showing an overall qualitative correspondence.</p><p>Two additional informative behavioral markers are the variance in the amount of information gathered across outcomes and across gambles. Attribute-variance in information gathering is defined as the variance of the proportion of clicks made on each row/outcome, being zero if clicks are evenly divided across outcomes. High attribute variance is a signature of "non-compensatory" strategies that focus attention on a subset of attributes (because the less important attributes cannot "compensate" for the more important ones) <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">(Payne, 1976b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al., 1988)</ref>. Alternative-variance in information gathering is defined in the same way, but for columns. High alternative variance is a signature of strategies that either gather more information for high-value gambles (as in SAT-TTB+) or stop searching once a high-value gamble is found (as in SAT-TTB). <ref type="figure">Figure D2</ref> shows qualitative correspondence between participants and the resource-rational model for both of these measures. As the stakes increase, both the resource-rational model and the participants spread their clicks more uniformly both across attributes (attribute variance; B = −0.01, p &lt; 0.001) and alternatives (alternative variance; B = −0.004, p = 0.0016), likely due to an overall increase in information gathering. When one outcome was much more likely than all others, people tended to compare many alternatives on that single outcome without considering any other outcomes. As predicted, increasing the differences between the probabilities of different outcomes (higher dispersion) therefore made people distribute their attention less evenly across the different attributes (B = 0.0091, p &lt; 0.001) and more evenly across the alternatives (B = −0.0026, p &lt; 0.001). Finally, increasing the cost of information made people more discerning in how much attention they paid to different attributes (B = 0.017, p &lt; 0.001) and different alternatives (B = 0.009, p &lt; 0.001). <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al. (1988)</ref> predicted that time pressure would have a similar effect, but observed a null result on alternative variance. As noted below, this may be due to a small sample size in their study. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure D3</ref> shows the qualitative correspondence between the model and participants for these two measures across all fifty decision environments.</p><p>It is noteworthy that whereas <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al. (1988)</ref> observed more selectivity for alternatives (higher alternative variance) with high dispersion, our resource-rational model makes the opposite prediction and this prediction is confirmed by participant behavior.</p><p>Our prediction makes sense intuitively: as dispersion increases, information from less likely attributes becomes less useful, and therefor multiple samples within a single alternative become less useful, consistent with more frequent use of TTB and less frequent use of SAT-TTB+ as dispersion increases (middle panels of <ref type="figure">Figure 4)</ref>. The most likely explanation for this inconsistency is that the result of <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al. (1988)</ref> was spurious, as the study included only 16 participants and the p value was between .01 and .05. <ref type="table">Table D1</ref> presents results of additional statistical tests for the results reported in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance</head><p>In addition to providing a framework for discovering heuristics, our formalism provides a realistic normative standard for human decision-making. This allows us to determine to which extent human deviations from perfectly rational decision-making can be attributed to resource-rational consideration of the cost of gathering information vs.</p><p>genuinely irrational use of one's cognitive resources. We measured people's relative performance by the fraction of the highest expected reward attainable with perfect information, omitting the cost of information gathering. This relative measure allows as to compare resource-rational performance of the model to unboundedly optimal performance with perfect information (i.e., maximum expected value). Omitting the cost of information gathering is useful for this comparison, and for comparing gross performance across cost conditions.</p><p>As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, our resource-rational model performs relatively close to the unboundedly optimal standard of 1.0, falling shorter when less information is gathered.</p><p>Concretely, the average relative performance was 0.895. Furthermore, our model accurately predicted that participants' relative performance increases with the stakes (B = 0.039, p = 0.0035), decreases with the dispersion of the outcome probabilities (B = 0.059, p &lt; 0.001), and decreases with the cost of gathering and processing information (B = −0.063, p &lt; 0.001). These results are shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.</p><p>It is apparent that participants under-perform compared to the model. The average relative performance of all participants was only 0.542. Thus, 23% of the gap between all participants' performance and the performance of the unboundedly optimal decision strategy (i.e., maximizing expected value) can be explained by resource-rational sensitivity to the imposed click cost, whereas 77% is due to people's deviations from the resource-rational model. Importantly, this proportion could be further reduced by accounting for additional costs and constraints not considered by our model, which we set out to do in Experiment 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 6</head><p>Participants show a qualitative correspondence to the model in performance across conditions in Experiment 1. Performance was measured as the relative reward earned on each trial (the fraction of the highest possible reward with perfect information, omitting click costs). Error-bars show the 95% CI across participants. <ref type="table">Table E1</ref> summarizes the main effects, corrections for multiple comparisons, and effect sizes for measuring relative performance across conditions. <ref type="figure">Figure E2</ref> shows a qualitative correspondence between participants' and the resource-rational model's relative performance across all 50 environmental conditions; see Appendix E for detailed results when excluding low-effort participants who gambled randomly on more than half of all trials (16.6% of participants).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sources of under-performance</head><p>Our resource-rational model allowed us to investigate how close human performance comes to the upper bound established by our resource-rational model. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>, people performed systematically worse than the resource-rational model across all environments. Participants' average relative performance was 60.6% that of the model, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>. Measured in raw points, participants achieved an average of 31.8 fewer points per trial than the resource-rational model. What explains this sizable gap? There are at least four possible reasons why people might be suboptimal: implicit costs of information gathering, imperfect use of the gathered information, imperfect strategy selection, and imperfect strategy execution. As detailed below and illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, participants achieved 61.4% (95% CI [58.8, 61.9]) of the net performance of the model,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 7</head><p>Sources of under-performance in Experiment 1. Participants' net performance was 61.4% (95% CI <ref type="bibr">[58.8, 61.9]</ref>) that of the model, with four distinct sources of the remaining 38.6% gap depicted here.</p><p>with each of these four sources respectively accounting for 4.2%, 4.2%, 25.0%, and 5.2% of the remaining 38.6% participant under-performance (measured as a percentage of the model's net performance, as detailed below. See Appendix E for detailed results when excluding low-effort participants).</p><p>We now describe these four sources of under-performance, and assess the degree to which they contribute to people's under-performance in turn. The measure of relative performance plotted in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> omitted the costs of information gathering (to facilitate comparisons across conditions), and measured relative performance as a fraction of performance with perfect information (to assess the model's resource-rational performance against an unboundedly optimal upper bound). Here (including <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>, we used net performance, defined as the payoff received minus the costs of information gathering, as a fraction of the model's performance. This measure of net performance allows us to compare people's resource rationality against the standard set by our normative model. This analysis revealed that, on average, the net performance of participants' decision strategies was 61.4% (95% CI [58.8, 61.9]) of the net performance of resource-rational decision-making. The four sources of under-performance collectively account for the remaining 38.6% gap in their performance.</p><p>First, participants may be influenced by costs not accounted for by our resource-rational model. This might be able to explain why participants collected less information than the resource-rational model. These costs might capture, for example, the cost of the time required to move a cursor and make clicks, as well as the anticipated cognitive costs associated with processing the revealed information <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(Payne et al., 1988)</ref>. To assess the degree to which insufficient information gathering led to participants' suboptimal performance, we ran 1,000 simulations of the model on each of the exact same trials presented to human participants, and measured net performance. To control for the overall amount of information gathered between our method and participants, we fit an implicit cost of information gathering to match the average number of clicks made by participants using a grid search. We found that an implicit cost of 2.4 points per click led to the same amount of information gathering on average as participants. We then measured the net performance of the model with an implicit cost of clicking of 2.4, and found a 4.2% reduction from the model without an implicit cost (as depicted in <ref type="figure">Figure 7)</ref>.</p><p>A second source of under-performance is the imperfect use of gathered information.</p><p>That is, given the information revealed, participants may simply fail to select the gamble with the highest expected value. This shortcoming can be accounted for by the effort required to compute such values in this task. To measure the extent to which people are suboptimal because they make imperfect use of the collected information, we computed the conditional expected values of all alternatives given the information revealed by the participant. We then compared participant net performance to what it would have been had they chosen the gamble with the highest information-contingent expected value. As with the previous source of under-performance, this difference in net performance was measured as a percentage of the resource-rational model's net performance.</p><p>A third possible source of under-performance is imperfect strategy selection. At an aggregate level, people use the same heuristics as the model in roughly correct proportion for each environment. However, on a trial-by-trial basis, they may not always choose the most effective heuristic. We compared the strategy selected by participants on each trial to that chosen by the model. To measure imperfect strategy selection, we measured the reduction in net performance on trials in which participants chose a different strategy than the model, while controlling for the previous two sources of under-performance (by conditioning on the amount of information gathered and the use of information). 4 As before, this reduction in net performance was quantified as a percentage of the net performance of the resource-rational model. Finally, even when participants choose the same strategy as the model, they may not execute it perfectly. For example, they may set an incorrect satisficing threshold in SAT-TTB, or they may consider too many or too few additional features in SAT-TTB+.</p><p>Such imperfect strategy execution is the fourth potential source of under-performance. To calculate this, we compared the participants' and the model's net performance when there was agreement in trial-wise strategy selection, again controlling for the first two sources of under-performance, and again measuring it as a percentage of the model's net performance.</p><p>Together, these four factors cover all possible ways in which people might deviate from the normative standard of resource-rational decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 8 Sources of imperfect strategy selection and execution in Experiment 1. Each cell states participants' average reduction of net performance from a trial-wise comparison of model-participant strategy selection. Off-diagonal cells correspond to imperfect strategy selection, while on-diagonal values correspond to imperfect strategy execution. Colors correspond to the number of trial-wise model-participant strategy pairs. For example, the upper-left cell shows that trials in which participants and the model both selected</head><p>SAT-TTB+ contributed to 4.0% to the decrement of participants' net performance (with 9,625 such trials occurring out of the 47, 360 trials across all participants, thus the yellow color). The cell just below that shows that participants on average lost 1.8% when they selected SAT-TTB+ but the model chose SAT-TTB, with 3,394 such trials occurring (thus the teal color). <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> shows the contribution of each of these four sources to under-performance. Implicit costs of gathering information account for 4.2% of participant under-performance.</p><p>Participants failed to choose the gamble with the highest subjective expected value on 27.3% of all trials, losing 10.4 points on average on such trials. This imperfect use of information accounts for 4.2% of the participants' under-performance. Imperfect strategy selection accounts for the majority of participant under-performance (25.0%), with random gambling accounting for most of it (13.9% of participant under-performance). Overall, these results suggests that while people use resource-rational decision strategies and adapt them to the environment in a similar way as the resource-rational model, they often do not use the optimal strategy on a trial-by-trial basis.</p><p>Finally, <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref> also shows that imperfect strategy execution contributes 5.2% to participants' under-performance. Errors in executing SAT-TTB+-the most complicated strategy-accounted for most of this source. <ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref> displays the average reduction in performance based on a trial-wise comparison of participant and model strategies.</p><p>Off-diagonal values correspond to imperfect strategy selection. For example, trials in which participants gamble randomly and the model chooses SAT-TTB+ account for 7.5% of under-performance, and the sum of off-diagonal values in the "random" column equals the corresponding 13.9% displayed in <ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>. On-diagonal values correspond to imperfect strategy execution. For example, when both participants and the model chose SAT-TTB+, participants lost an average of 4.0% of the model's net performance. Colors depict the number of trials occurring for each participant-model strategy pair.</p><p>Consistent with the idea that people first choose a decision strategy and then execute it, we found that participants deliberated longer before the first click (2.92 sec) than before subsequent clicks (0.81 sec, t(2549) = 128.5, p &lt; 0.001). Deliberation time also predicted information gathering, such that longer deliberation was followed by more frugal strategies (0.62 fewer clicks for each second spent deliberating; B = −0.62, t(38737) = −37.6, p &lt; 0.001).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>While our resource-rational model successfully predicted how participants adapt their decision heuristics and other behavioral measures to the statistics of the decision environment, they still fell considerably short of the standard set by our model. We have attempted to understand the origins of this under-performance.</p><p>The first source of under-performance-implicit costs of gathering information-was measured by controlling for the amount of information gathered by the model. The parameter for the implicit cost of information gathering is meant to account for all additional costs of gathering and processing one piece of information people might experience. This approach assumes that people plan rationally, subject to their cognitive costs. However, it is also possible that people simply gather less information than they should. Furthermore, a simple cost-per-click is only a rough approximation of the true information processing costs (which likely vary depending on which information was acquired). Better characterizing the computational costs involved in risky choice, and dissociating implicit costs from suboptimal information gathering, is an important direction for future research.</p><p>It is worth noting that the physical effort required in our task to move the cursor and click on cells was a useful experimental adaptation to objectify the cognitive cost of information gathering. The Mouselab task typically reveals information when the cursor simply hovers over a cell, occluding it once again when the cursor leaves the cell, which is thought to mimic the real-world process of gathering information through eye movements.</p><p>While there is mixed evidence whether information gathering in Mouselab differs significantly from eye movements <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Glöckner &amp; Betsch, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Lohse &amp; Johnson, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Reisen et al., 2008)</ref>, these other forms of information gathering could also in principle be captured in a more complicated meta-MDP model. Future work may apply our resource-rational approach to more precisely identify the underlying cognitive processes involved in deriving heuristic decision-making.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2: Reducing cognitive constraints</head><p>To evaluate the extent to which participants' under-performance was due to implicit costs and cognitive limitations not accounted for by our model, we ran a second experiment with an experimental condition designed to remove or reduce some of those costs and mitigate those limitations. In particular, participants were forced to spend a minimum of 20 seconds on each trial, and the subjective expected value of each gamble given the observed information was displayed for each gamble and updated whenever new information was revealed. These two manipulations were intended to reduce the opportunity cost of the time it takes to obtain and process additional information and the cognitive cost associated with estimating the expected value of each gamble, respectively. We predicted that these manipulations would bring people's decision strategies into closer alignment with the predictions of our resource-rational model by reducing unaccounted costs of information gathering and helping people use the acquired information as effectively as our model does.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>We recruited 404 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk (250 males, mean age 37.5 years, standard deviation 10.8 years), and paid them $0.50 plus a performance-dependent bonus of up to $4.23 (average bonus $1.66) for about 13.3 min of work on average (standard deviation 6.4 min). Informed consent was obtained using a consent form approved by the Institutional Review Board at Princeton University.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli and procedure</head><p>The experiment used a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects factorial design with a total of 8 conditions. The factors we varied between participants were the dispersion of outcome probabilities (α ∈ {10 −0.5 , 10 0.5 }), the cost of collecting information (λ ∈ {1, 4}), and whether the participant was in the experimental group or the control group. The stakes of the decisions were low in all conditions (σ = 75).</p><p>For the control group, the task and the instructions were identical to the previous experiment. For the experimental group, the subjective expected value of each gamble given the observed information was displayed next to the label for each gamble. Thus, each time a participant clicked on a cell to reveal its value, the expected value for that gamble was updated according to Equation 3 and displayed atop that column. Furthermore, the experimental group was forced to spend a minimum of 20 seconds on each trial, and a countdown timer was displayed for the first 20 seconds of each trial. After the first 20 seconds, participants were free to spend additional time if they so chose. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 9</ref> shows a screenshot from a trial of the experimental condition. These two features of the task were incorporated into the instructions received prior to the task for this group. As a result of these differences, participants in the experimental group spent more time on the task and earned a greater performance bonus on average (16.9 ± 5.3 min, $1.77 ± $0.97) than participants in the control group (9.8 ± 5.2 min, $1.54 ± $0.95).</p><p>The stakes of the decisions-that is, the variation in outcomes-were always low (σ = 75). To eliminate variance in performance due to random sampling of trials, we used a single set of 40 problems (20 for each dispersion level), such that every participant in a given condition solved the same set of problems. All participants were required to pass the same comprehension quiz used in the previous experiment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Information gathering and choice behavior</head><p>The shift toward more costly heuristics in the experimental group is apparent in an overall increase in information gathering compared to the control group, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 12</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Performance</head><p>The model's relative performance was 0.886, that is, 88.6% of the gross performance of the unboundedly optimal strategy that always chooses the gamble with the highest expected value, with perfect information. Similar to Experiment 1, this percentage was only 47.9% in the control group. By contrast, for the experimental group, it was 67.8%.</p><p>Excluding low-effort participants increased these percentages to 62.1% for the control group and 78.8% for the experimental group, with the model's relative performance equal to 87.9% for the same trials. This suggests that about 44% of the control group's total performance gap relative to unboundedly optimal performance stems from unaccounted cognitive limitations. The resource-rational model explains an additional 32% of this gap.</p><p>The remaining 24% appear to result from people's deviations from resource-rational decision-making. This suggests that people are more resource-rational than they appeared in Experiment 1. Concretely, the results suggest that people might be at least 76% resource-rational. Improving the model further could lead to further upward adjustments of this estimate.</p><p>Given that participants in the experimental group behaved more similar to the optimal model in some manners/cases but less similar in others, we next asked how participants' overall performance was affected by the experimental intervention. To address this question, we compared participants' net relative performance. In contrast to the gross relative performance measure used in the preceding paragraph and shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> from Experiment 1, this measure includes the cost of gathering information in addition to the payoff of the chosen gamble. This measure of performance does not give an unfair advantage to participants in the experimental group, who gather more information. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 13</ref>, participants in the experimental group achieved numerically higher performance in three of the four environments, but not in the LD-HC environment. This improvement, however, was only significant in the HD-LC environment (t(100) = 2.60, p = 0.011, d = 0.52). The difference was not significant in any other environment (LD-LC: t(102) = 1.51, p = 0.13, d = 0.30 ; LD-HC: t(100) = −1.77, p = 0.079, d = −0.35 ; HD-HC: t(94) = 0.73, p = 0.47, d = 0.15). Across all conditions, participants in the experimental group were not significantly more resource rational than participants in the control group (t(402) = 1.12, p = 0.26, d = 0.11).</p><p>Participants in the experimental group should be expected to choose the gamble with the highest subjective expected value on 100% of trials, since they were given these values (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 9</ref>). However, they failed to do so on 17.6% of all trials. As a result, they actually lost more points per trial on average than participants in the control group as a result of these errors (3.3 versus 1.6 points per trial, t(402) = −2.34, p = 0.02, d = −.23).</p><p>This counter-intuitive result is manifestly an artifact of participants not performing the task in good faith, since participants in the experimental group were given the best option.</p><p>Whereas low-effort participants have the option to gamble randomly in the control group or in Experiment 1, in the experimental group they are forced to wait 20 seconds. It appears that such low-effort participants gambled randomly after gathering excessive information during the forced wait. To address this, we excluded an equal fraction of participants from both groups based on participant deviation from model performance (see the section on Experiment 2 in Appendix E for details).</p><p>When excluding low-effort participant from both groups, participants in the experimental group were significantly more resource-rational than participants in the</p></div>

Compared to participants in the control group (left pie chart), participants in the experimental group (right pie chart) showed slightly better overall performance, with no implicit costs of gathering information, and much less reduction from random gambling.

As described in the previous section, this is due to low-effort participants in the experimental group not performing the task as instructed, since the values were given to make perfect use of information. As shown in <ref type="figure">Figure E7</ref>, when excluding low-performing participants, imperfect information use accounted for 2.1% of under-performance in the control group and 1.9% in the experimental group.</p><p>We next considered how imperfect strategy selection and execution differed between the two groups. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 14</ref>, imperfect strategy selection accounted for 28.8% of under-performance in the control group and 23.6% in the experimental group, while imperfect strategy execution accounted for 2.3% and 5.5%, respectively. Consistent with Experiment 1, engaging in random gambling was the most frequent instance of imperfect strategy selection for participants in the control group, alone accounting for 21.7%) of under-performance. In the experimental group, this proportion was reduced to 5.2%. On the other hand, whereas the use of WADD accounted for only 0.9% of under-performance in the control group, it accounted for 8.3% in the experimental group, more than any other strategy. While imperfect execution accounted for a modest proportion of under-performance in both groups, it was slightly more in the experimental group, due to the increased usage of the difficult-to-execute SAT-TTB+ strategy. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 15</ref> shows the sources of imperfect strategy selection (off-diagonal values) and execution <ref type="bibr">(diagonal values)</ref> from every strategy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The experimental manipulations in Experiment 2 were effective at reducing the implicit cost of information gathering identified in Experiment 2. The most pronounced effect of increased information gathering in the experimental group was a reduction of random gambling and increase in the use of WADD and SAT-TTB+. However, in the high-cost conditions, participants in the experimental group actually gathered too much information. Surprisingly, we did not find that imperfect use of information was reduced in the experimental group (in fact, it increased, although not after excluding low-effort participants). When excluding low-effort participants, we did find that participants in the experimental group were significantly more resource-rational than participants in the control group. However, there was still room for improvement in this group. Overall, these findings suggest that people deviate from resource-rational decision-making even in settings where the assumptions of the resource-rational model are met.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p>Traditionally, rational models and the heuristics and biases approach have offered very different views of human decision-making. As a result, researchers studying human decision-making have typically had to choose between assuming people are rational or characterizing their behavior as the result of following heuristics that result in systematic biases. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. Assuming rationality makes it easy to generate predictions across a wide range of circumstances, but people sometimes systematically deviate from rational principles. Research on heuristics and biases has characterized these deviations, but with many possible heuristics, it can be difficult to predict what people will do in novel situations.</p><p>In this work, we have offered a way to reconcile these two perspectives-rationality and heuristics-by deriving optimal heuristics for multi-alternative, multi-attribute decision-making from a rational analysis of how people should allocate their limited cognitive resources. This approach of applying rationality to cognitive processes themselves provides a general framework for understanding decision-making that can also make task-specific predictions. Drawing on ideas from artificial intelligence and machine learning, we were able to both establish a normative basis for previously identified heuristics and also discover new heuristics that had previously been overlooked. Furthermore, we collected a large dataset to test our method across a very broad range of decision environments, demonstrating both the generalizability and accuracy of our approach. Our results show that people use all the heuristics that our method identified, and they adaptively select which heuristic to use in a way that is consistent with our framework. However, the match was by no means perfect; there is still room to improve on human decision-making.</p><p>One of the key ideas behind our approach is that we can formulate the problem of discovering heuristics and predicting when they should be used as one of finding the optimal policy of a meta-level Markov Decision Process <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Hay et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b125">Russell &amp; Wefald, 1991b)</ref>. The meta-level MDP framework allows us to identify those heuristics that optimally trade off the costs associated with acquiring information to update one's beliefs about the world with the benefits of that information. This results in a normative view of heuristics, providing a reconciliation between these historically divergent views of decision-making. While information gathering in Mouselab has previously been studied from a resource-rational perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Gabaix et al., 2006)</ref>, the meta-MDP framework provides a new set of computational tools for understanding heuristics through this lens.</p><p>The result is that we can formally identify heuristics that achieve an optimal trade-off between computational costs and decision quality. By automatically deriving heuristics from a normative model, we can avoid the cumbersome and inexact process of searching for heuristics by hand that psychologists have relied on in the past.</p><p>In addition to offering a normative standard for evaluating heuristics, the meta-MDP formalism makes our resource-rational framework generally applicable to any decision-making process. This formalism breaks down decision-making into an arbitrary discrete set of cognitive operations, and then applies reinforcement learning to this decision-making process itself. This provides a general-purpose approach for deriving optimal heuristics that avoids the need to search an intractable combinatorial space of possible heuristics. It also provides a normative benchmark for evaluating heuristics, that is, by the total meta-level reward they achieve.</p><p>We demonstrated the usefulness of this approach using the Mouselab task, which is a classic, well-studied process tracing paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Payne et al., 1993)</ref>. While the Mouselab task has been widely used to study decision strategies, these studies are typically limited to around 20 − 40 participants (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arieli et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Bieleke et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Dieckmann &amp; Rieskamp, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Lohse &amp; Johnson, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Payne et al., 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Reisen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b121">Rieskamp &amp; Otto, 2006)</ref>), rarely exceed 100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Dhar et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Mata et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b132">Sen, 1999)</ref>, and the largest study that the authors are aware of collected 255 participants in a 2 × 2 between-subjects design, which examined the interaction between negative affect and choice difficulty on decision strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b143">(Stone &amp; Kadous, 1997)</ref>. In the present study, we searched for heuristics across a broad space of decision environments and tested whether strategies change across the parameters of those environments. This necessitated a large-scale experiment using the Mouselab task. Future work may apply our meta-MDP framework to potentially any kind of decision-making process, providing a general-purpose, normative approach for understanding how people think and derive strategies for making decisions.</p><p>We found that participants used the same four strategies as the resource-rational model; how did they acquire these heuristics? It is typically assumed that people have a limited toolkit of general-purpose heuristics that are adapted to real-world environments (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Gigerenzer &amp; Selten, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Hutchinson &amp; Gigerenzer, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Klein, 2008)</ref>. More specifically, heuristics are thought to develop slowly through evolution and/or learning, rather than being crafted on the fly at decision time. One consequence of this is that, in addition to limitations in cognitive resources and time, humans have a limited toolkit of heuristics to deploy-those which they have previously acquired through evolution and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Gigerenzer &amp; Selten, 2002)</ref>. That these general-purpose heuristics turn out to be resource-rational in our task highlights the effectiveness of these strategies, and perhaps the usefulness of the Mouselab task in capturing important characteristics of real-world risky choice.</p><p>In addition to offering a method for deriving optimal heuristics, our approach provides a more realistic framework for both evaluating and improving human decision-making. To rigorously evaluate and improve decision-making, we should understand the agent's computational goal and how it goes about solving it. The resource-rational analysis presented here is an attempt to reverse-engineer this decision process by comparing human behavior to the predictions of our resource-rational model. In our experiment, people did indeed use the same strategies as the resource-rational model. Furthermore, the heuristic solutions arising from our framework are inherently sensitive to the statistics of the decision environment-including the stakes of possible reward, the dispersion of possible outcomes, and the cost of acquiring information-and people adapted their strategies to the decision environment in a manner largely consistent with resource-rationality. While participants' performance was consistent with rational use of cognitive resources, they performed below the level of the resource-rational model <ref type="bibr">(Figures 6)</ref>. Crucially, the under-performance persisted even when we modified the environment in such a way that the assumptions of our resource-rational model were met (Experiment 2). This suggests that human decision-making still has room for improvement, even when people's cognitive constraints are taken into account. Our method could be used to provide feedback and teach people which heuristics to use and under what circumstances, in a manner that accounts for their cognitive limitations, providing a computationally informed path to improving human decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Becker et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Callaway et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Consul et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Mehta et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b141">Skirzyński et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Why did people under-perform relative to the resource-rational strategies? First, it is important to note that our normative framework should not be mistaken for a descriptive account. Rather, it provides a prescriptive account of how people ought to behave in the Mouselab task. It is therefore not surprising that participants earned less reward than the resource-rational model. Indeed, a key contribution of our approach is that it allowed us to characterize in detail how and (to some extent) why people deviated from the resource-rational benchmark. While these sources of under-performance suggest specific ways that people could improve their decision-making strategies, achieving perfect resource-rationality may still be unattainable. In fact, given that resource-rational decision-making is itself an intractable problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b123">(Russell, 2016)</ref>, this is almost certainly the case. Importantly, however, this does not undermine the value of the approach, for many of the same reasons that traditional rational or "computational level" analyses are useful <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anderson, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Marr, 1982)</ref>. Providing a rational benchmark for resource-constrained agents reveals both the strengths and weaknesses of human decision-making, and suggests important directions for future research.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the under-performance, one which we did not consider above, is that the computations people use are different from those assumed by our model. Specifically, we assumed an idealized set of cognitive operations based on Bayesian updating, such that each piece of revealed information is perfectly integrated into a posterior belief about the expected payoff of the corresponding gamble. But if that integration process is itself composed of multiple costly operations (e.g. multiplication and addition), then people might not-and indeed, should not-fully integrate all revealed information. This would result in worse performance given the same number of clicks.</p><p>Applying our method with a finer-grained set of operations is thus an important direction for future work. By expanding the set of computational actions available, we can potentially identify more nuanced strategies and achieve an even closer correspondence to human behavior.</p><p>Overall, our findings show that participants use resource-rational heuristics in an adaptive manner, suggesting that people have highly effective mechanisms for discovering and selecting good heuristics. Understanding those mechanisms and how they emerge is an important direction for future research. On the other hand, the deviations from resource-rationality suggest that people might experience additional costs and that their mechanisms for discovering and applying heuristics are imperfect. Future research should attempt to characterize these costs, investigate how people discover heuristics, and develop interventions that improve people's capacity to discover and adaptively choose between heuristics.</p><p>Von Neumann, J., <ref type="bibr">&amp; Morgenstern, O.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>High dispersion leads to attribute-based processing</head><p>Outcome dispersion is an important determinant of information gathering and strategy selection, with high dispersion favoring attribute-based processing since one attribute is much more likely than others. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">Figure 12</ref> shows that information gathering decreases with dispersion for the experimental group, but increases with dispersion for the control group, and these contrasting patterns can be seen clearly in <ref type="figure">Figure D6A</ref>. We performed a follow-up exploratory analysis to see if this pattern is consistent with the model. The model does indeed predict a two-way interaction between dispersion and cost on information gathering, whereby information gathering decreases with dispersion at low cost, but increases with dispersion at high costs. This makes sense intuitively: when the cost of clicking is low, then lower dispersion merits more clicking since the most likely attribute is less informative on average, but when the cost of clicking is high, then higher dispersion allows more frugal clicking that focuses on the most likely attribute. As predicted by the model, when the cost of clicking is low, participants in the experimental group click more with low dispersion (t(99) = 3.19, p = 0.0019, d = 0.63), but unlike the model, for high cost, participants in this group click slightly less with high dispersion (t(95) = 0.40, p = 0.69, d = 0.08). The opposite pattern holds for the control group: clicking increases with dispersion for both high cost (as predicted by the model; t(99) = 2.32, p = 0.022, d = 46) and low cost (unlike the model; t(103) = 0.63, p = 0.53, d = 0.12).</p><p>In both groups, these seemingly contradictory results are, in fact, consistent with participants moving toward single-attribute-based processing as dispersion increases (as in TTB, which gathers exactly six samples of information, corresponding to the dashed line in <ref type="figure">Figure D6A</ref>).

This is actually not surprising, considering that, in Experiment 1, 16.6% of participants gambled randomly (without gathering information) on more than half of all trials; in Experiment 2, participants were forced to wait 20s before gambling, and therefore did not have the option to immediately gamble randomly, as they would in Experiment 1 or in the control group. To remove poor performers from both groups, we first computed the fraction of participants in the control group who gambled randomly on more than half of all trials (27.2%), to find comparable levels of poor performers across experiments (since the tasks were identical in Experiment 1 and the control group in Experiment 2). We then used this value to remove the bottom 27.2% of performers from each group in Experiment 2, but since the fraction of trials with random gambling is no longer a valid metric, we simply excluded participants based on their net performance as a fraction of the model's net performance. <ref type="figure">Figure E6</ref> shows that attentive participants in the experimental group out-performed attentive participants in the control group in every condition (LD-LC: t(55) = 2.36, p = 0.022, d = 0.63; LD-HC: t(80) = 4.02, p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.90; HD-LC: t(78) = 2.26, p = 0.027, d = 0.51; HD-HC: t(73) = 2.30, p = 0.024, d = 0.53).</p></div>

BMPS rests on the idea that the value of computation can be approximated by interpolating between the myopic value of computation, the value of perfect information about the gamble that the computation is reasoning about, and the value of perfect information. Concretely, the BMPS policy is To compute optimal risky choice strategies, we applied BMPS to the meta-level MDP model of decision-making in the Mouselab paradigm described in the main text. To achieve this, we instantiated the four features that BMPS uses to approximate the value of computation as follows: First, the value of perfect information is the expected improvement in decision quality if one knew the exact values of every gamble, rather than deciding based on the current belief state. Formally, it is</p><p>where the expectation over the true gamble values, v * g , is taken with respect to the current belief state, capturing the fact that previous computation informs how valuable future computation will be (e.g., if one gamble is already almost certainly better than the others, there is little value to computing more).</p><p>Second, the myopic value of information is the expected improvement in decision Appendix B</p></div>

As illustrated in <ref type="figure">Figure E1</ref>, the average relative performance of the remaining participants was 0.643, suggesting that the relatively low performance could not be fully (or even mostly) explained by low-effort participants (compare to <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>). The model's relative performance on the trials of attentive participants (0.907) was very similar to its relative performance on the trials of all participants. This suggests that at least 26% of the gap between attentive participants' performance and the performance of the unboundedly optimal decision strategy are due to people's sensitivity to click costs (which we use as a proxy for limited cognitive resources and opportunity costs), whereas at most 74% are due to people's deviations from resource-rational decision-making.

When applicable, post-hoc pairwise comparisons were conducted between all 10 pairs of levels of each independent variable using two-sample t-tests with the Tukey-HSD correction for multiple comparisons. These tests were not applicable (n/a) when the independent variable had only two levels or its main effect was not significant. The effect sizes for these comparisons were calculated using Cohen's d and are presented in ascending order of the corresponding levels of the independent variable (reporting adjacent pairs only).</p></div>			</div>
