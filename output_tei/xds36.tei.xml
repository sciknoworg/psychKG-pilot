			<abstract>
				<p>Co-creation with citizens has emerged as an integral component in tackling a plethora of healthcare inequities. At the stage of scientific conceptualisation, processes of integrating co-created insights as legitimate forms of knowledge lacks transparent method, risking disempowerment for citizens who have been positioned as influencing the research process. We detail an approach to integrating cocreated insights into a scientific model using an equitable and power-sharing approach (EPSA) method, exampled during the study design phase of the AFFIRM Relationships project. The EPSA method consist of 3 phases: a preparatory phase (Researcher reflexivity, topic formulation and sensitization); a cocreation phase (knowledge production, analytic phases, summarizing and ethics work) and an insight integration phase. Applying the EPSA method highlighted the important role of researcher reflexivity in preparing to foster a safe environment for open dialogue during co-creation. Transforming scientific research stages into activities that can engage co-researchers (including conducting analysis, critical thinking, and producing overarching themes) underscored an equitable partnership. Whilst the final phase enabled identification of how resulting knowledge was derived, further consideration of how refinement processes can be grounded in lived experience is necessary, particularly during final stages as decision making becomes increasingly led by academic team members.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Engaging with citizens in medical research is widely viewed as an important ongoing process throughout the research trajectory to define appropriate research priorities and to optimise solutions, while simultaneously empowering communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Greenhalgh, Jackson, Shaw, &amp; Janamian, 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Whilst the motivation and reasoning for citizen engagement is largely undisputed, it has been asserted that the operationalisation of such participatory methods is not entirely clear and that traditional research structures act as barriers to the engagement strategies health researchers feel they can implement <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(van Dijk-de Vries, Stevens, van der Weijden, &amp; Beurskens, 2020)</ref>. For example, research projects are often subject to pre-defined expectations and timelines from funding bodies which do not align with participatory research (PR) agendas <ref type="bibr">(Nixon et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Sibbald, Tetroe, &amp; Graham, 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Research teams may question how to methodologically incorporate insights derived from working with citizens alongside already existing theory in a manner that does justice to both lines of knowledge.</p><p>Additionally, researchers have voiced challenges of contending with power hierarchies embedded within traditional structures of institutional research practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bourke, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Within PR, empowering communities through modes of co-learning and aims of equalizing and sharing power <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Israel, Checkoway, Schulz, &amp; Zimmerman, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wallerstein, 2020)</ref> is key to prevent misrepresentation. Embedded within empowerment are the establishment of equitable partnerships, where research teams consider how citizens and communities may experience empowerment themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Namaste, 2009)</ref> alongside a commitment to representing the diversity within communities. Co-creation has evolved as a popular overarching method with which to operationalise the epistemological pursuits of PR <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Masterson, Areskoug Josefsson, Robert, Nylander, &amp; Kjellström, 2022)</ref>. Broadly defined, co-creation is a continuous, active process of knowledge production together with those whom the research hopes to influence (e.g., citizens). In doing so, citizens can then influence research by creating legitimate knowledge and shared value <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Vargas, Whelan, Brimblecombe, &amp; Allender, 2022)</ref>. It has been recommended that co-creation be applied flexibly to enable widened, inclusive participation and to suit the specific needs of citizen co-researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Scher, Scott-Barrett, Hickman, &amp; Chrisinger, 2023)</ref>. However, alongside its flexible application are trends of co-creation practices which lack transparent and clear reporting of methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Slattery, Saeri, &amp; Bragge, 2020)</ref>. There are few examples in the literature of how co-created and co-produced knowledge informs scientific research and practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tembo, Morrow, Worswick, &amp; Lennard, 2019)</ref>. There are also discrepancies regarding what methods count as PR. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Wallerstein (2020)</ref> argues that focus groups, for example, cannot be seen as fully participatory if most research decisions are made by the researcher. Yet, focus groups and other qualitative methods make up the majority of co-creation efforts in past work <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Agnello, Balaskas, Steiner, &amp; Chastin, 2024a</ref>).</p><p>An increased trend of implementing co-creation with varying conceptualisations (or lacking concrete conceptualisations) <ref type="bibr">(Williams, Sarre, et al., 2020)</ref> reflects its increased popularity and its expected integration by funding bodies. However, this also reflect a tokenistic form of engagement (Jones, 2018) that does not uphold central principles, such as deconstructing power hierarchies. This is illustrated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Roura (2021)</ref>: "Behind the curtains of post-its and flipcharts, contributions that do not fit into preconceived ideas of the "right" responses may be silenced through the often subtle ways in which power mechanisms operate in real-life settings" (p.780). Practical challenges for applying powersharing in PR were recently highlighted by <ref type="bibr">Egid et al (2021)</ref> in their focus group study with 59 participatory researchers across 24 countries. They found that the topic of power was 'rarely' discussed with co-researchers and that knowledge around power inequities was merely assumed to be understood by those involved. Therefore, despite the importance of empowerment, it seems that power-sharing is often ill-defined in practical terms. Given that many health researchers look to the extant literature for guidance and inspiration on how to practically reflect the theoretical tenants of PR in their co-creation efforts, such varying operationalization may contribute to a misalignment of method and theory in the conceptualisation stages of health research.</p><p>We argue that doing PR with citizens in the context of theory-driven scientific research risks disempowerment and requires clear methods which transparently demonstrate how lived experience insights are integrated into research outputs and study design. In this paper, we describe a worked example of co-creation with transgender (trans) people who are actively involved as co-researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Wright, 2015)</ref> to update the conceptual model underpinning the AFFIRM Relationships project. We propose and demonstrate an approach to co-creation that is underpinned by principles of equitable partnerships and power-sharing, and so the methods described are particularly relevant for researchers working with citizens who have been historically mis-/under-represented in research processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Riggs et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Context</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>AFFIRM Relationships is a European Research Council (ERC)-funded project based at the</head><p>Amsterdam UMC in the Netherlands which aims to examine how trans people feel within themselves and in their social relationships when on gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). The project focuses on psychosocial functioning, reflecting a variety of traits, characteristics and dispositions related to self-, interpersonal-and emotional functioning, as well as broader social health <ref type="bibr">(Doyle &amp; Link, 2024)</ref>. The information and knowledge generated from this project will strengthen the scientific evidence base and can contribute to tailored and updated information provision during medical gender affirmation. A variety of methods are being utilized within the overarching project, including qualitative inquiry, secondary data analysis, ecological momentary assessments and a prospective observational cohort study of those starting on GAHT. An Initial conceptual model was developed based on previous literature and theory (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Doyle, Lewis, &amp; Barreto, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lewis, Doyle, Barreto, &amp; Jackson, 2021)</ref> In this model, GAHT was positioned as influencing psychosocial functioning via a pathway of biological changes, a pathway of psychological factors, and a pathway of sociocultural influences. It was then posited that resulting changes in psychosocial functioning would play a role in how people feel and behave in their relationships with others.</p><p>Lived Experience group. To build on the previously established knowledge and to refine the conceptual foundations of the AFFIRM Relationships project, a lived experience group (those with lived experience of being on GAHT as well as close others of those on GAHT ) was established. Individuals in this group are referred to as Lived Experienced Experts (LEEs). LEEs are involved in activities throughout the trajectory of the project, including co-creation sessions to create knowledge, acting as advisors on practical project aspects, and sense checking on project findings. For activities where LEEs are actively engaged as researchers, they are referred to as co-researchers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Research Team</head><p>We conceptualise and write this paper from the multiple perspectives of a team consisting of contracted (NM, DD and BK), student (RK), and co-researchers (BB and SA) conducting participatory work in a medical research institution. The broader AFFIRM Relationships team includes researchers from varying academic backgrounds, including social psychology, health psychology, neuroendocrinology and gender studies. We aim to influence gender-affirming healthcare through contributing mechanistic and practical knowledge on the social health of trans people during the care trajectory. Whilst many team members have extensive experience of researching on transgender healthcare within hospital settings, no members of the core team work in a clinical capacity.</p><p>We are primarily motivated to integrate a PR perspective into this work to ensure that trans people's voices are represented in the project, and this was already a key documented priority at the time of funding application. As a team, we have considered how insights derived from engaging with LEEs can be integrated alongside theory-based knowledge to avoid co-creation efforts becoming merely a tick-box exercise. In particular, we have reflected on the risk of doing 'extractive research,' i.e. extracting knowledge from a community to benefit academia without giving back to the community <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gohlan, 2024)</ref>. We are aware that such practices can further disempower communities and individuals and perpetuate power imbalances <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Farr, 2017)</ref>, and we are committed to implementing strategies which can transform technical scientific stages. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to provide an example of co-creation underpinned by an equitable and power sharing approach (EPSA) during scientific conceptualisation for other health researchers doing PR with citizens, and to transparently document our process of integrating co-created insights into scientific output.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods and Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recruitment and procedure</head><p>Those who took part in this study were recruited to the AFFIRM Relationships lived experience group as LEEs. The current study uses a worked example from two participation activities (a co-creation session and a questionnaire refinement session) that LEEs were invited to partake in. Information about the experience group was created in both English and Dutch to encourage participation by a diverse group of trans people and their close others (Supplementary Material 1.1) and was centrally shared on the project website (www.affirmrelationships.com). Recruitment efforts included sharing the information via public outreach at trans health events; via trans-specific organisations (including those reaching marginalised groups of trans people, e.g., those with a migration background) Trans United and Transvisie; through the study Instagram page (@affirmrelationships); and through relevant Whatsapp groups initiated by LEEs. LEEs were compensated financially for their time (30 euro per activity), and were reimbursed for travel costs. To transparently and accurately document the cocreation process, it was deemed necessary to record workshops with signed consent of LEEs. Ethical approval for the recordings and use of these as 'data' was approved by the Amsterdam UMC Medical Ethics Committee (Approval Number: 2023.0793).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Equitable Power-Sharing Approach (EPSA) Method</head><p>The EPSA method is theoretically and practically informed by empowerment theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Israel et al., 1994)</ref> and the social ecology of power framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Roura, 2021)</ref>, which acknowledges the various system levels at which power imbalances reside (e.g., personal, interpersonal and structural). The approach is situated within a critical realist ontology, which is a meta-theory well-suited to the needs of co-creation research <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Messiha et al., 2024)</ref>. Critical realism acknowledges the knowing of a 'real' and 'observable' reality, thus welcoming insights from varying perspectives to understand causation (i.e. why and how a phenomenon occurs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wynn &amp; Williams, 2012)</ref>. It is often viewed as a middle-ground theory, presenting the world as 'theory laden, but not theory determined' <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Fletcher, 2017)</ref>. Thus, critical realism endorses pluralist approaches to collecting insights from both theoretical and lived experience sources. The principles of equitable partnerships and power-sharing guided the use of methods. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> illustrates how these principles have been integrated into the EPSA method.  <ref type="bibr">(Mulvale et al., 2024</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Preparatory Work</head><p>As with any community engagement in research, extensive preparatory work is essential to produce conscious and tailored methods and to stimulate creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Emke et al., 2024)</ref>. The following preparatory steps were deemed necessary to embed the co-creation process in an equitable and power-sharing approach:</p><p>Researcher Reflexivity. The process of reflexivity is commonly applied in qualitative methods and in PR to acknowledge a researcher's position whilst recognising the subjectivity inherent in interpretation to derive meaning and value . Whilst we align our operationalisation of reflexive practice with Braun and Clarke (2023) that a knowing researcher can 'own their perspectives,' (p.1) we suggest that reflexive practice also acknowledges how one's perspectives can develop and change over time during the co-creation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Izzidien et al., 2024)</ref>. NM and RK engaged in continual reflexive practice both as facilitators in the current study and as interviewers on a parallel and related qualitative study.</p><p>Individual reflexive practice was facilitated by considering questions about positionality taken from Braun and Clarke (2023) available in supplementary material 1.2.</p><p>A group reflexivity session was organized prior to the co-creation workshop whereby NM, RK and a third member of the broader research team came together to discuss how their individual reflections held similarities and discrepancies. The session did not utilize a systematic structure but rather allowed conversation to evolve through learning about how each researcher's knowledge has shaped their approach to the project. This session also led to the identification of ways in which an equitable and power-sharing approach could be optimised and practically strategized. For example, the topic of sharing information about one's positionality with co-researchers was deemed an essential step to share power. Team members reflected on how best to practice this, whilst considering how much of their story they are willing to disclose <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Vincent, 2018)</ref>. In this way NM and RK were able to reflect on how to set personal boundaries whilst also maintaining a level of transparency that would</p><p>foster trust and open dialogue during the co-creation workshops.</p><p>Topic Formulation. To facilitate bottom-up knowledge production from a critical realist lens, it is necessary to formulate a co-creation topic that can provide direction for co-researchers to situate their experience but which is broad enough to shed light on individual and nuanced experiences. Given that the overarching aims of the current project were pre-determined, it was necessary that the topic enabled discussion of which aspects of psychosocial functioning and social experiences should be prioritized in a cohort trial. Thus, the topic was: "Changes within oneself and in relationships with others when on gender-affirming hormones". Research teams should also consider what type of knowledge is relevant and whether analytic steps are necessary for the co-creation process. In our case, given that the aim was to translate insights into measurable constructs that could be used in a future trial, it was deemed necessary for co-researchers to critically guide this process and play an active analytical role in creating a final set of priorities.</p><p>Sensitization. Sensitizing people to the topic before co-creation sessions is standard practice in order to enable optimum engagement and creative thinking during the session <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Visser, Stappers, van der Lugt, &amp; Sanders, 2005)</ref>. Given the potentially sensitive nature of the current topic, possibly amplified by discussing in a group setting, we decided to enact sensitization by revealing the topic to co-researchers prior to the workshop and asking them to reflect on their own experiences in advance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Co-creation</head><p>The second phase of the EPSA method concerns the production and creation of value related to the research topic via in person co-creation workshops. LEEs were allocated to workshop groups based on their experience with the topic (e.g., experience with GAHT or being a close to someone on GAHT) and their availability. To stimulate knowledge production during the workshops, a method was constructed which includes elements borrowed from structured conceptualisation processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Trochim, 1989)</ref>, multidisciplinary collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Lidvig, Hillersdal, &amp; Earle, 2017)</ref> and design thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sanders &amp; Stappers, 2012)</ref> alongside tailoring to ensure that the method aligned with principles of equitable partnerships and power-sharing. The 10-step method is detailed in short in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. It follows a series of diverging (elevating individual experience) and converging (relating to other's experience) steps and is broadly divided into 4 stages related to knowledge production and analysis followed by a summary of the findings and continual ethics work throughout <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Groot &amp; Abma, 2022</ref> Analytic Steps. The analytic steps prompted co-researchers to think about the produced topic cards in a holistic and critical manner. In step 5 (grouping), co-researchers were firstly asked to identify any cards which overlapped in their meaning and to merge these cards into one pile with the top card clearly displaying the overarching descriptor. Then, co-researchers were asked to consider which cards were similar or related in their meaning and to group these by placing them close to each other. If discussion during this step led to the identification of new meaning (for example a concept which acted as a bridge between 2 cards) then a new card could be created or an existing card could be re-written to facilitate grouping at this stage. Once all cards had been grouped, co-researchers were then asked to consider all cards holistically and to think about which cards stood out to them as most relevant for the research and to mark these with either a sticker or a marker (step 6; flagging). We did not suggest a limit for the number of cards that co-researchers could flag but emphasised the importance of thinking critically about what would be important to prioritise in the research study. In step 7</p><p>(Iteration), each co-researcher was asked to reflect on why they had chosen the cards that they had flagged. These reflections often evolved into discussions between co-researchers with diverging and converging experiences coming to light. In step 8, co-researchers were asked to reflect on why certain cards had not been flagged. NM and RK prompted discussion by posing questions of whether any topics were in fact covered by other cards, or if there were any topics that were not well-understood by coresearchers and required further explanation. On discussing these points, cards could be grouped again and descriptor names could be further refined as done in step 5. In step 9 (final theme set), each coresearcher was asked to choose one card that best reflected what they felt should be prioritised in the research. Where several co-researchers preferred the same card, they were asked to consider other cards which had meaning for them and to put these forward instead. The prioritised cards were placed on a piece of paper ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Supplementary Material 1.</ref>3). Co-researchers were then asked to reflect upon and discuss how these final themes did or did not relate to each other, from their own experience. An excerpt from this discussion during workshop 2 is detailed in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>. When co-researchers came to a consensus on how certain themes were related to each other they represented this by drawing arrows between topic cards on the paper. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref> illustrates finalised key themes and their relation to each other from both workshops. In step 10 (Summary), co-researchers were invited to summarise the story around their final set of themes. This can be done by one co-researcher or as a group. breaks. A significant portion of the workshop time was spent on step 4 'co-exploration' (90 minutes on average) in both sessions whilst the final step was not completed in workshop 2 due to time constraints and a difficulty in summarizing the findings as voiced by a co-researcher "I think it would also maybe be a little bit difficult to summarize it in for example one sentence" (Bernhard, father). <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.

Doing ethics work is an important and often invisible aspect of PR <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Groot &amp; Abma, 2022)</ref>. Referencing Banks (2016), ethics work covers "the psychological and bodily processes of <ref type="bibr">noticing, attending, thinking, interacting and performing" (p.36)</ref>. In our case, we paid attention to the emotional work that was done during co-creation workshops, and focused on how we as facilitators cared for the well-being of all members alongside showing compassion and empathy. We (NM and RK) came together to reflect on our own emotional well-being which helped us to prepare for subsequent sessions. We also consciously created space wherein we could reason with any dilemmas that arose during co-creation and the PR process more broadly. We did this via a creative reasoning session with a third external researcher who acted as a critical friend. In this session, we discussed ethical dilemmas around worries of not doing justice to lived experience voices and questions relating to how we could proceed without reducing LEEs to merely "people we spoke to". Doing this work allowed NM and RK to share and discuss ethical dilemmas and to feel heard in these. Additionally, discussions that arose from this ethics work were paramount to establishing the third phase of the EPSA method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Insight Integration</head><p>The third phase of the EPSA method included a process of integrating the co-created insights into research priorities, and translating these into measurable constructs for a future observational cohort study. This process included:</p><p>Development of a Co-created Construct List. Open coding was applied to the workshop transcripts, meaning that researchers approached coding without applying pre-determined categorisations to the insights. NM and RK coded both transcripts and met to discuss similarities and/or differences in their interpretations. They also discussed and finalized how codes would be translated into potentially measurable 'constructs'. Created constructs were then 'quantitized' whereby each construct was assigned a number based on the frequency that co-researchers referred to it in the transcript <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sandelowski, Voils, &amp; Knafl, 2009)</ref>. Based on these numbers, constructs were then hierarchically divided into high, medium and low priority with high priority being labelled as a frequency of 3 or more. An example of the open coding, construct translation and quantitization process is in Supplementary Material 1.4. The key themes that were prioritized by co-researchers ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>) during co-creation were automatically added to the high priority list. This process led to the identification of 64 co-created constructs (19 high priority; 16 medium priority; 29 low priority).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Development of a Theory-informed Construct List. Four months prior to the co-creation</head><p>workshop, the AFFIRM Relationships research team (including NM, BK, DD and other members of the broader team but not including co-researchers) engaged in a 'study away day' to brainstorm research priorities for the project, building on the initial model proposed by DD in the funding application. This brainstorming was informed by previous literature which had fed into the initial model along with additional domain-specific knowledge from the inter-/multi-disciplinary researchers in the team. This session resulted in the creation of a theory informed construct list and these were also hierarchically divided based on the significance of their theoretical contribution to a potential model. This session led to the identification of 93 constructs (55 high priority; 25 medium priority and 13 low priority).</p><p>Merging of Construct Lists. Constructs which were conceptually contained within another (for example confidence and confidence about physical appearance) were firstly redefined. Then, on combining construct lists from both the co-creation and brainstorming sessions, it was found that 13 constructs were mutually rated high priority (e.g, social gender affirmation, and authenticity), 2 constructs were mutually rated medium priority in (anxiety and emotional intensity), 1 construct was mutually rated low priority (physical well-being) whilst 17 constructs were identified with differing priorities during both sessions. A full list of the identified constructs and their ratings can be found in Supplementary file 2.</p><p>Refining the Construct List. The merged construct list was further refined by the academic research team and then by a sub group of co-researchers. The academic research team firstly considered the double high priority-rated constructs and whether measurement was feasible via an existing validated tool or the likely development of a novel measurement tool (e.g., social gender affirmation). Remaining constructs were evaluated based on their theoretical contribution, on the qualitative reasoning from the co-creation sessions and the potential for the construct to be measured in a cohort study. For example, an adequate standardized measure for the construct of 'self-focus' did not exist whilst the standardised measure for 'gender euphoria' was not feasible so these constructs were removed. A draft questionnaire with measurements for each construct was compiled.</p><p>Then, a refinement session was held with BB, SA and a third co-researcher which was facilitated by 2 members of the broader academic research team. In the session, the research team presented an overview on the scientific basis for questionnaire development and considerations when using validated questionnaires before all members completed the draft questionnaire. During questionnaire completion, co-researchers were asked to reflect on how they felt about answering each questionnaire regarding how relevant they felt the construct was alongside the appropriateness and comprehension/ clarity of measurement. All members were given stickers that they could use to flag certain questionnaire aspects where they felt refinement should be considered and each member provided their own Individual reflections on the questionnaire completion. A resulting 54 refinement points were documented, with 21 points relating to the overlap of constructs with others (e.g., emotional reactivity, emotional intensity, emotional regulation and alexithymia) and/ or questioning the relevance of a construct to the current study (e.g., sexual orientation). The majority of other discussion points related to the clarity of questionnaire instructions and the (un)pleasantness of completing certain questions.</p><p>The group discussed each point, and in many cases a solution was suggested after discussion (e.g., maintaining inclusion of sexual orientation measurement). Agreed solutions for each refinement point were documented on a shared screen visible by all members.</p><p>A new conceptual model. Finally, an updated conceptual model was generated based on the solutions agreed upon in the refinement session. The updated model can be viewed in the supplementary material 1.4. For transparency, the academic research team fitted the final constructs into the new model labelling how each construct was derived (either from: The initial model; the research brainstorming; the co-creation session or a combination).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>In this paper we detail an approach to co-creation and insight integration which is underpinned by an equitable partnerships and power-sharing approach (EPSA). The EPSA co-creation method is an example of how citizens can be engaged in knowledge production and critical thinking to come to a nuanced consensus during scientific conceptualization phases of research. In this paper we also exampled how we attempted to transparently integrate co-created insights into a final scientific output.</p><p>It is often acknowledged that co-creation methods are not transparently described <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Slattery et al., 2020)</ref>. Reasons for this have been suggested, including word limits for certain journals limiting the detail with which methods can be detailed along with an emphasis on study outcomes rather than study processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Agnello, Balaskas, Steiner, &amp; Chastin, 2024b</ref>) and a lack of relevant systematic reporting guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Masterson, Lindenfalk, Kjellström, Robert, &amp; Ockander, 2024)</ref>. Thus, it is generally thought that this lack of transparency does not reflect a lack of effort, but rather a lack of published documentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Masterson et al., 2022)</ref>. With the EPSA method, we propose three necessary PR stages (preparatory work, co-creation and insight integration) in order to actively engage with citizens in health research in a meaningful and transparent way. In particular, the EPSA method provides examples of how and when to use reflexive practice, how to transform scientific processes into activities that can engage non-academic researchers and how to transparently integrate co-created knowledge into existing theoretical knowledge foundations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Reflexive Practice and a Safe Space</head><p>In the EPSA, reflexive practice is operationalised in the preparatory stage via individual and group reflexivity sessions. Whilst incorporating some mode of reflexivity is common in PR <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Izzidien et al., 2024)</ref>, those methods which are informed by design-thinking and business models (van Dijk-de Vries et al., 2020) may be less inclined to establish reflexive exercises in their practice when applied to health research. This is reflected in a recent review by <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Masterson et al (2024)</ref> who found that processes related to engagement, such as developing trusting relationships, are not likely to be captured during reporting of PR methods. Introspection about one's identity, motivations for doing research, underlying assumptions and previous experiences can lead to growth on the part of the researchers by increasing self-awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Attia &amp; Edge, 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Izzidien and colleagues (2024)</ref> exampled how using reflexive diaries can capture learning, progress and achievements. On the other hand, group reflection can be instrumental in recognising similarities and discrepancies between researchers' perspectives whilst dialogue around this can promote processes of empowerment and challenge hierarchical relations <ref type="bibr">(Farr, 2018)</ref>. Group reflexivity can also lead to embedding equitable partnerships by reflecting on whom research tends to represent and if a gap exists, how this can be bridged <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Muhammad et al., 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Vincent (2018)</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Knowles et al., 2021)</ref>. In our study, creating a safe environment was key to establishing rapport that elicited both agreements and disagreements. Additionally, researchers explained how the goal of their work related to dismantling power inequalities and to having positive influence for the co-researchers (whilst also being aware of their own personal boundaries) which was important for fostering this honest dialogue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Actively Engaging LEEs in Scientific Research Stages</head><p>Technical stages of the research process which require specific trained skills can be a particularly vulnerable time for disempowerment on the part of co-researchers. <ref type="bibr">Travers et al. (2013)</ref> noted in the Trans Pulse project that as tasks became more 'scientifically sophisticated' (p 413), community researchers began to question their role and the value of their input. Transformation of such research stages into activities that can actively engage co-researchers in a meaningful way are evident in the EPSA method. In combination with an initial step to create a safe space, the latter stages include a series of steps which invite co-researchers to analyse and critically examine the knowledge produced. Engagement was enhanced through breaking the process down into a number of small exercises, with each exercise building on the previous <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Visser et al., 2005)</ref> and through in-the-moment analysis, similar to 'on-the-wall' analysis techniques used in design thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Sanders &amp; Stappers, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>We found that these analytic steps not only encouraged reflection from individual perspectives, but also encouraged prompting between co-researchers to deepen their understanding of each other's experiences. Akin to thematic analysis procedures involved in qualitative data analysis, the EPSA method leads to the creation of an overarching set of key areas or themes ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>) that can be used in a number of ways to suit the needs of a particular research stage. For example, the final theme set could act as research priorities or as a way to summarise key findings which have come directly from the co-researchers themselves, and where expertise in qualitative data analysis is not required.</p><p>Whilst resulting 'agreement' between actors is often positioned as necessary to produce results <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Masterson et al., 2022)</ref>, we acknowledge cautionary responses to a simplistic merging of ideas to form a consensus <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Senge, 2006)</ref>. With this view, a step of discussing how the key themes do and do not relate to each other is included. This step opens up conversation to diverging and converging ideas and allows the group to uncover potential underpinning theoretical mechanisms at play as seen in the excerpt of dialogue ( <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). This step once again moves co-researcher input from that of providing knowledge and experience to creating meaning and value that can be applied to a scientific context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Insight Integration into Research</head><p>The third phase of the EPSA method provides an example of how co-created insights were integrated to update and refine a conceptual model and thus to determine constructs for measurement in an observational cohort study. We used an experiential approach to working with co-researchers through involving them in critically thinking about the study questionnaire which included each construct in its likely form of measurement. The output from this stage represents a significant contribution in transparently distinguishing the origin of each construct (i.e., being derived from: the initial model, researcher brainstorming, co-creation or a combination). However, we note that the number of constructs derived from co-creation is lower than that of researcher brainstorming whilst the extent to which the inclusion of constructs was determined by co-researchers in the resulting model is not well defined. Thus, in our study we found that decisions around refinement and iteration of the construct lists were informed by co-researcher insights but ultimately led by academic research team members. This observation is echoed throughout participatory work <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Oliver, Kothari, &amp; Mays, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Williams, Robert, Martin, Hanna, &amp; O'Hara, 2020)</ref> as it is generally seen that the latter stages of co-creation, including refining and creating results are less well understood in their mechanistic</p><p>properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Masterson et al., 2024)</ref>. Reasoning for this in our study can largely be attributed to the hierarchies in scientific training between academic researchers and co-researchers. Although we found merit in an experiential approach, the practical barriers related to questionnaire length and comprehension often dominated conversations rather than discussing construct prioritization.</p><p>It is also important to consider that whilst participatory engagement was an important priority of the AFFIRM Relationships project, the specific aims of the project were established a-priori by the principal investigator, as expected by the majority of funding bodies. As a result, it seems that some of the knowledge produced during co-creation was not within the boundaries of these aims and so was not progressed during refinement processes. This reflection speaks to the importance of transparently communicating the boundaries of possibilities within research projects to co-researchers alongside moderating discussions to align with these boundaries, or if maintaining broad lines of inquiry being prepared to deviate from pre-established aims. At a research stage where the goals of PR are more explorative, there may be greater opportunity to integrate a broad range of insights. For example, in their stepwise concept mapping approach, <ref type="bibr">Bourke et al. (2005)</ref> engaged citizens in a session of exploring hierarchical clustering solutions of qualitatively co-produced ideas as a way to gain consensus on which key themes should represent the goals of their research. This mixed-methods approach demonstrates an example of refining and elevating key ideas, however the output is more similar to that which results from the EPSA co-creation phase rather than the insight integration phase.</p><p>Engagement with a critical friend (a researcher who is external to the project but is specialised in PR)</p><p>during the insight integration phase could be beneficial in further grounding processes of refinement and decision making in lived experience, particularly as these progress from experiential sessions with co-researchers to discussions solely between the academic team.</p><p>Overall, including an insight integration phase aligns with calls for clearer and more transparent documentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Masterson et al., 2024)</ref>. This is particularly relevant when lived experience insights are being added to theoretical knowledge, rather than being knowledge that a project is initially grounded in. Similar to reflections by <ref type="bibr">Izzidien and colleagues (2024)</ref>, we suggest that integration of insights should follow lines of genuine and transparent engagement which are equitable rather than aiming for equal participation between academic researchers and co-researchers, as this may be impractical and instead lead to disempowerment. We also acknowledge the myriad of invisible positive outcomes that result from researching with citizens in a manner that seeks to deconstruct power hierarchies. These include, and are in no way limited to: developing trusting relationships with citizens and learning how to step out of 'researcher zone', challenging dominant narratives which exist in hierarchical research practices and continuously re-establishing the framing of a research project to align more with lived experience.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>There is an assumption in participatory research that knowledge derived from lived experience and theoretical sources should be equally weighted to inform outputs. Attending to this, the EPSA method is grounded in principles of equitable partnerships and power-sharing with an emphasis on transparent documentation of how insights are integrated into scientific research. Applying the EPSA method resulted in a refined scientific model that combines co-created and theory-driven insights with clear documentation of how each construct was derived. We found that incorporating regular structured and unstructured reflexivity was integral to maintaining transparent lines of communication between academic and non-academic researchers and to foster a safe environment for open dialogue. Whilst time consuming, actively engaging co-researchers through transforming scientific practices was pivotal to empowering co-researchers and sharing academic power. Finally, even though an experiential approach lowered the barrier of entry to dialogue around integrating co-created insights with existing theory, our implementation demonstrates a divergence in expertise when participation in research stages require decision making that is informed by scientific training. The EPSA method is a systematic avenue for co-creation with citizens during conceptualisation phases of health research. Whilst methods for insight integration must be tailored to the specific aims of health research projects, clear and transparent documentation on such processes are central to maintaining and restoring power to citizens and communities.</p></div>

To begin the co-creation workshop, NM and RK presented to the coresearchers on the workshop aims, answered any questions in relation to the project more broadly, and invited all members to write their pronouns on a name tag. In step 1 (session values), coresearchers were asked to consider what type of environment was necessary to foster an open and reciprocal dialogue. Answers were submitted into an online Menti platform which were then (anonymously) visible to the rest of the group. Co-researchers were then asked to think about what values were important to enable such an environment and to write these values on a table cloth which was then pinned on a wall in the room and each member discussed the values they had put forward. , people with a migrant background, being autistic, having a (current or previous) mental illness, being a parent, being in a romantic/sexual relationship(s) and being single.In step 3 (sense making) co-researchers were prompted to think about the session topic "Changes within oneself and in relationships with others when on gender affirming hormones", and for workshop 2, the wording was altered to also account for experiences of close others. Co-researchers were invited to make sense of this topic by writing or drawing what this topic meant to them on a card (exampled in supplementary material 1.3). Co-researchers received a handful of cards. It was suggested that separate ideas or meanings be represented on different cards, and to use short phrases or small</figDesc><table><row><cell>Knowledge Production.</cell></row></table><note>Examples of words and phrases used were: open, safe space, trusting each other, feeling heard, non- judgemental and space to talk uninterrupted. This discussion led to practical solutions, for example, the decision to integrate a traffic light system (red meaning stop; orange meaning pause and green meaning continue) to help monitor how people felt about discussing certain topics. Step 2 (introductions) involved each member (including academic researchers) introducing themselves. At this stage we began audio recording the workshops. It was emphasised that co-researchers could disclose personal information they felt was relevant with no types of information deemed to be mandatory and that potentially identifiable information would be anonymized at the point of transcription. Ten people took part in the co-creation workshops and each person has been given a pseudonym. Six co-researchers took part in workshop 1 and 4 in workshop 2 (4 trans women [Penny, Frida and Anna and Kyra], two trans men [Shane and Tom], 2 non-binary trans people [Ash and Elias]), 1 husband [Jeroen] and 1 father [Bernhard]). The introduction session indicated that there was representation of multiple identities and characteristics within the group, including: white people, people of coloursentences. These concise descriptors would serve as initial notes, as there would be later opportunities to elaborate on the meaning. In step 4 (co-exploration), co-researchers described how each card with writing or drawing had meaning for them. If the discussion sparked new ideas or thoughts, co- researchers were prompted to create new cards to cover the additional information that was not visible at that stage.</note></figure>
