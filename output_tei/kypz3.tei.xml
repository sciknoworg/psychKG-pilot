<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abstract:</head><p>Catecholamines have long been associated with cognitive control and value-based decisionmaking. More recently, we have shown that catecholamines also modulate value-based decisionmaking about whether or not to engage in cognitive control. Yet it is unclear whether catecholamines influence these decisions by altering the subjective value of control. Thus, we tested whether tyrosine, a catecholamine precursor altered the subjective value of performing a demanding working memory task among healthy older adults <ref type="bibr">(60-75 years)</ref>. Contrary to our prediction, tyrosine administration did not significantly increase the subjective value of conducting an N-back task for reward, as a main effect. Instead, in line with our previous study, drug effects varied as a function of participants' trait impulsivity scores. Specifically, tyrosine increased the subjective value of conducting an N-back task in low impulsive participants, while reducing its value in more impulsive participants. One implication of these findings is that the over-the-counter tyrosine supplements may be accompanied by an undermining effect on the motivation to perform demanding cognitive tasks, at least in certain older adults. Taken together, these findings indicate that catecholamines can alter cognitive control by modulating motivation (rather than just the ability) to exert cognitive control.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>While catecholamines (dopamine and noradrenaline) have long been known to impact capacity for cognitive control, the catecholamines have been proposed to also mediate cost-benefit choices about whether or not to exert cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>. According to the expected value of control account, people recruit cognitive control in proportion to expected instrumental value <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>, such that degree (and intensity) of engagement in an upcoming cognitive computation is based on a cost-benefit analysis. Recently, we demonstrated that acute administration of a single oral dose of the catecholamine transporter blocker methylphenidate indeed modulated the avoidance of, but not ability to perform cognitive control in young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. The effect depended on trait impulsivity, with the most impulsive subjects exhibiting the greatest increases in control avoidance. Here, we extend this work by assessing the effects of a catecholamine precursor on the expected value of cognitive control, again as a function of trait impulsivity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Catecholamines and (cognitive) effort</head><p>The role of catecholamines in decisions about effort expenditure have been the focus of studies for decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref>. A well-replicated finding, in both human and non-human animals is that striatal dopamine blockade or dopamine lesions reliably shift preferences away from high effort/high reward options to low effort/low reward options (e.g. 6; see 5 for review), while increases in striatal dopamine shifts preferences towards high effort/high reward options <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(9)</ref>. For example, patients with Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by dopamine cell loss in the striatum, forego reward to avoid effort (handgrip squeezes) relative to healthy controls when tested off their dopaminergic medication. Conversely, when tested on their medication, patients selected higheffort/high-reward options as much as controls, reflecting less physical effort avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref>. Thus, increases in dopamine transmission have been associated with increased motivation for physical effort.</p><p>As is the case for physical action, cognitive control is also effortful / costly such that people tend to avoid it <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">11)</ref>. For example, they prefer to perform a task with less rather than more task-switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr">(15)</ref> and with lower rather than higher working memory load, even when incentives are larger for higher loads (16). However, unlike for physical effort, the role of catecholamines is less clear for decision making about cognitive effort. One way in which dopamine might bias choices about cognitive tasks is by altering the (expected) value of cognitive control (i.e. the reward benefits minus the effort cost of control). This follows also from neurocomputational models of dopamine in the basal ganglia, such as the OpAL model, which suggest that increases in (striatal) dopamine tone, result in more emphasis on the benefit, and less on the cost of an action due to more direct pathway excitability, via D1 receptor binding, and less indirect pathway excitability, via D2 receptor binding <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(17)</ref>. Thus, taken together with the hypothesis that cognitive control follows from cost-benefit decision making, we expect that increases in catecholamine synthesis will emphasize the benefits versus the costs of control, thereby increasing the motivation for instrumental cognitive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>.</p><p>There is some evidence that dopamine signaling can offset the costs of cognitive control.</p><p>In one study, costs were offset by incentives, which are putatively signaled by dopamine release, thus leading to more cognitive and motor control in a visual saccade task <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(18)</ref>. Critically, this effect was diminished in patients with Parkinson's disease, supporting a role for dopamine in mediating incentives effects on performance. Since performance could be altered via multiple catecholamine-dependent mechanisms, however, it remains critical to show that catecholaminergic drugs can alter cost-benefit decision-making itself. Direct tests of this prediction have yielded conflicting results. In one study, dopaminergic medication increased the selection of high-cognitive effort/high-benefit tasks in Parkinson's disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(19)</ref>. By contrast, a rodent study failed to observe changes in rats' willingness to expend cognitive effort for reward after treatment with a dopamine antagonist <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(20)</ref>.</p><p>Conflicting results may stem from individual differences in baseline dopamine function and/or cognitive motivation. In one study, amphetamine motivated rodent 'slackers' (but not 'workers') to choose a more perceptually-demanding option for a higher reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(21)</ref>. In parallel, our recent work with young healthy adults has shown that the administration of methylphenidate (20 mg, oral) altered the avoidance of higher task-switching demands, in a demand selection paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. The effect of methylphenidate depended on participants' trait impulsivity, a measure previously associated with drug-induced dopamine release and D2/D3 (auto-)receptor availability (22). Relative to placebo, methylphenidate increased the avoidance of effortful task-switching to a greater degree in more impulsive participants. These studies indicate that catecholamine interventions might have varying effect on motivated cognition across different individuals, likely as a function of baseline levels of dopamine function <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(23)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>While prior work established a link between catecholamines and cognitive demand</head><p>avoidance, it remains unclear whether catecholamine manipulation influences the value of cognitive control (4). Here we employed a cognitive effort discounting task (COGED) that enabled us to explicitly quantify the value of cognitive control (16) and its modulation by a catecholamine challenge. The COGED paradigm consists of 2 phases: an effort execution phase, during which participants complete multiple levels of the demanding N-back task (levels 1-4 back) and an effort discounting task, during which participants choose between repeating a more demanding level for more money, or the 1-back for less money. Unlike the demand avoidance paradigm, choices are separated in time from performing the effortful task; as such, choices do not reflect learning of effort costs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tyrosine intervention in older adults</head><p>A second key way in which we go beyond prior studies is that we administer a catecholamine precursor (i.e. tyrosine) instead of a catecholamine transporter blocker (i.e. methylphenidate).</p><p>Tyrosine is a precursor of dopamine and noradrenaline and the administration of tyrosine stimulates synthesis and release of catecholamines (24-28). The main source of tyrosine is protein-rich food, but tyrosine has also been administered selectively as an over-the-counter food supplement for study purposes and has been shown to alter cognition (see 29 for review). In young adults, tyrosine administration has been shown to improve cognitive control functions that are commonly associated with catecholamine transmission, such as working memory, response inhibition, and task switching (see 29,30 for reviews).</p><p>In the present study, we administered tyrosine to older adults, aged 60-75, for the following 2 reasons: i) Healthy aging has been reported to be accompanied by a decline in dopamine transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(31)</ref>, making older adults perhaps more sensitive to tyrosine administration. A recent meta-analysis revealed lower prefrontal and striatal D1 and D2 receptor densities and striatal dopamine transporters with increasing age <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(32)</ref>. Diminished dopamine function is supported by evidence of reduced reward responsivity in elderly, evidenced by impaired reward learning, attenuated BOLD signal in the ventral striatum in response to reward, and less risky choices in gain trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(35)</ref>. ii) The well-established decline in cognitive functioning with advanced age <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(36)</ref>, has often been attributed to diminished cognitive control capacity, but may partly reflect motivational rather than capacity constraints. Thus, using the COGED paradigm, older adults have been shown to be less motivated to engage in effortful cognition (16). Given that older adults are thought to exhibit diminished catecholamine function and they are less motivated to engage in cognitive effort, we speculate that lower catecholamine transmission contributes to reduced motivation for control. Following empirical and theoretical work on dopamine's role in cost-benefit analysis of cognitive actions, we hypothesized that augmenting catecholamine tone by the administration of the catecholamine precursor tyrosine can restore motivation for cognitive effort in older adults.</p><p>The effects of tyrosine administration have been shown to depend on the baseline state of the system. For example, tyrosine was shown to be particularly effective in enhancing cognitive control when the catecholamine metabolism was enhanced by acute stress or high cognitive demand, while having no or disruptive effects in other conditions where the need for catecholamine transmission is lower <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">37)</ref>. Higher doses of tyrosine have been shown to increase plasma tyrosine concentrations to a greater degree in older than younger adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(38)</ref>, and have been associated with poorer N-back performance than lower tyrosine doses <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(38)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, tyrosine was recently found to reduce proactive response inhibition as a function of age (39). Although we do not have direct measures of baseline catecholamine function in our sample, we explored in supplemental analyses whether the effects of tyrosine depended on two commonly used proxy measures of baseline dopamine levels: trait impulsivity and working memory capacity (see also 4,40): trait impulsivity scores for their association with dopamine (auto)receptor availability and striatal dopamine release (22), as well as working memory span, associated with striatal dopamine synthesis capacity <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">42)</ref>. Previously, we have shown that trait impulsivity predicts the degree to which methylphenidate modulates demand avoidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Thus, while our study was set up to assess the hypothesis that tyrosine administration would increase the value of cognitive control, we also explored whether tyrosine altered the value of cognitive control in a manner that depended on either of two dopamine proxy measures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Participants</head><p>Exclusion criteria for this study were a history of clinically-significant psychiatric, neurological or cardiovascular disorder, abuse of drugs or alcohol, abnormal blood pressure (&lt; 90/60mmHg or &gt; 160/90 mmHg), medication use that can interfere with tyrosine, blindness or colorblindness, smoking more than 1 pack of cigarettes per week, or contra-indications for MRI. For a complete list of exclusion criteria, see Supplemental Material 1.</p><p>After a screening session, thirty-three healthy, right-handed adults were initially included for participation. However, four additional participants were excluded or decided to discontinue during or after the first experimental session, due to blood pressure exceeding our inclusion criteria (n = 1) and fMRI-intolerance (anxiety: n = 1; nausea: n = 1, headache: n = 1), leaving a sample of 29 participants who completed both experimental sessions (age: M = 66.7, range = 61-71, 16 men). Our paradigm consists of two phases (see §2.4): an effort execution N-back task and a cognitive effort discounting (COGED) task. The COGED task is of primary interest to our research question and we have 29 complete datasets available. Due to technical, back-up problems, we have 26 complete datasets of the effort execution N-back task (day 1 = 27; day 2 = 28), even though all 29 participants completed this task. As our primary research question regards the COGED task, we report questionnaire and neuropsychological assessment data for the complete sample (n = 29) in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. All procedures were in accordance with the local ethical guidelines approved by the local ethics committee (CMO protocol NL49758.091.14) and in line with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Procedure</head><p>A within-subjects, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design was employed.</p><p>Participants visited the institute three times: once for a screening and twice for experimental sessions of around 4.5 hours <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>).  <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">48)</ref> were assessed because we had explicit, though exploratory, questions, related to the COGED paradigm (see §2.4). Scores of these self-report questionnaires are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Included participants were also familiarized during the screening session with the cognitive test battery that was administered during the subsequent experimental sessions. This familiarization consisted of practice of a response inhibition task (39), a working memory task (cf. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">51)</ref> and the N-back task (see §2.4, based on (16). Afterwards, participants were guided to the fMRI facility and their weight was assessed for adequate dosage calculation (see §2.3).</p><p>The two experimental sessions were identical, except that participants received placebo on one day and tyrosine on the other (counterbalanced across participants). Participants were asked to come to the lab in the morning (at 8 am or 10 am) after overnight fasting: they refrained from eating, drinking except from water, and taking any medication after 10 pm of the previous day. The overnight fast reduces variability in plasma large neutral amino acid levels between participants caused by the previous meal <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(51)</ref>. A similar fasting procedure has been adopted in other research using tyrosine supplementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(52)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(53)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(54)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(55)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(56)</ref>. Sessions started approximately at the same time of the day (maximal deviation was 90 minutes), with an interval of one week to a max of 17 weeks between testing days. After informed consent, participants practiced the response-inhibition task (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">39)</ref>, and right after drug administration (see §2.3), each level of the N-back task was rehearsed followed by the practice of another working memory task (cf. 51). The cognitive test battery consisted in total of 3 paradigms <ref type="figure">(Figure 1</ref>). The order of practice and paradigms was constant across sessions and participants, such that the effort execution N-back task was always administered soon after drug intake (~+ 20min). To isolate effects on choice from effects on execution, the effort execution (i.e. N-back) task was timed to immediately follow ingestion of the intervention, so that tyrosine was highly unlikely to have taken effect during task execution, given its delay in reaching peak concentrations (±2 hours, see §2.3). Then, after a break of 90 minutes, the response inhibition task (39) and working memory task (cf. Fallon et al., 2016) were administered during fMRI. After fMRI (duration ~90 minutes), the COGED task was administered together with a N-back redo which is based on participants' choices (see §2.4). The delay between tyrosine administration and the COGED task (described in §2.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. For safety reasons, blood pressure and heart rate were measured three times throughout the days (start of testing day, before task battery, after task battery). At the same time points, participants' mood was assessed using the Bond and Lader Visual Analogue Scales (calmness, contentedness, alertness; 63). For exploratory purposes, assessing tyrosine's effect on dopamine metabolites, urine was collected on both testing sessions off drug (i.e. before drug administration) and around the peak of tyrosine concentration (i.e. right after the fMRI part).</p><p>Intervention effects on mood, blood pressure and urine data (all T1-T0 due to peak level of intervention) are reported in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Supplemental Material 2 reports mood and blood pressure data for T2-T0. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Schema of study setup (A) and experimental sessions (B). A An initial screening was followed by two identical (except for placebo versus tyrosine intervention) experimental sessions.</p><p>Duration between screening and session 1 was on average 22 days, between the two experimental sessions on average 20 days. To prevent any carry-over effects of pharmacological interventions, the experimental sessions were separated by at least 7 days. B During the experimental sessions, participants received placebo or tyrosine and conducted a test battery (see §2.2). The effort discounting choice task was administered after an fMRI session and took place around 3 hours after the intervention in a behavioral lab.</p></div>

The entire protocol was programmed and administered using Psychophysics toolbox (69,70) in MATLAB.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1">Effort execution: N-back task</head><p>Participants completed the N-back task three times: a longer version during the screening session and a shorter version during the experimental sessions. The tasks were administered in behavioral labs with participants sitting comfortably in front of the screen, hands located on the keyboard. Participants were instructed to complete a working memory task in which they are presented with series of letters in the center of the screen and that they need to respond by indicating whether each letter is either a target or non-target by keypress ( <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2A</ref>). All versions start with easiest, 1-back level and increased block-wise to the highest, 4-back level. In the 1back task, participants compared the current letter to the letter presented 1 position (i.e. screen) back and if the letter was identical, they pressed the target key; if not, they pressed the non-target key. For the 2-back task, a target was defined as identical letter presentation 2 screens back, etc.</p><p>The practice phase during screening consisted of three runs for every load level, the experimental sessions had two runs. Each run comprises 64 items (consonants, 24-point Courier New font, 16 targets, black font). Participants were instructed explicitly at the beginning of each new level, which level they were about to complete. In addition to this explicit information, dark grey shapes were presented in the background which participants could learn to associate with the different N-back levels, see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2A</ref>. Beyond indicating the current task level and rules, the shapes had no other utility for performing the N-back task. Shapes had a diameter of 10 cm and were presented in the center of the lighter gray screen as the background of the letter stimuli on each trial. Participants had 1.5 s to respond to each item by button press, after which items were replaced by fixation cross. The inter-item interval was 0.  the amount offered for the easy task increases while it decreases when the easy choice is chosen.</p><p>The amount adjustment reduces exponentially (by the power of 2), see C. B2.

Participants were told that they could choose which N-back level they want to repeat for earning a monetary bonus and that one of their choices would be randomly be selected and played out: they would repeat 1-10 runs of the N-back level that they selected and receive the monetary bonus attached to their choice.</p><p>To reduce avoidance of mistakes rather than effort, we instructed participants that they would receive the bonus if they do their best and perform comparable to the practice round on the same day.</p><p>Choice options were presented on the left and right side of the screen. Levels were referred to by the same shapes that participants learned to associate with each N-back level during practice and effort execution on the same day (see §2.4.1). To minimize confusion about levels, participants also had access to a paper sheet reminding them of the relevant shape-level associations. The amount of the monetary bonus was presented in the center of the shape <ref type="bibr">(36-</ref>point Courier New font, black font). Each of the 3 higher levels (N= 2-4) was paired with the easier 1-back level in two different amount categories: higher levels were either offered at €2 or €5. For the first paring, the amount offered for the easy task was half the amount offered for the harder task, thus €1 or €2.50, respectively. Depending on participants' choices, the amount offered for the easy task was adjusted (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2B</ref>.1): when participants chose the harder/high offer option, the amount offered for the easy task on the next pairing was increased; when the easier/low offer option was chosen, the amount offered on the next trial would decrease. The magnitude of amount adjustments was cut in half after each adjustment such that the offer for the easy task converged towards a point of indifference. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 2C</ref> presents the adjustment path for the easy offer when participants always select the easy (red bars) or hard (green bars) task. The indifferent) when the easier task is worth 80% of the amount offered for the harder task. A lower SV thus indicates that a participant chooses to receive less money but increases the likelihood to redo an easier task. After the choices paradigm, all participants completed their randomly selected choice exactly four more times and were paid the associated amount for each repetition.</p></div>

Trait impulsivity, digit span and Need for Cognition Scale were included in our secondary, exploratory analyses and will be described in more detail below. Scores on other acquired measures are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Trait impulsivity</head><p>The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11; 47) was administered to assess participants' degree of trait impulsivity. The scale is a self-report questionnaire, consisting of 30 statements that participants rate on a 4-point Likert scale ("never" to "almost always"). Examples are "I buy things on impulse" or "I am future oriented". Scores on this questionnaire can range from 30 to 120. The total Barratt score has been found to be associated with reduced dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability in the midbrain, and enhanced dopamine release in the striatum (22,72) and has been shown to predict effects of MPH on learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(73)</ref>. This measure served as a putative proxy of baseline dopamine function in the exploratory analyses (see §2.6).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Digit span</head><p>Baseline working memory capacity was assessed with the digit span (58) at the end of both experimental sessions. The digit span consists of two parts: forward and backward digit span. In the first part, participants' task was to repeat series of numbers that are presented via headphones in the same order as presented (forward). Series start with three numbers and increase up to 9</p><p>numbers. Participants complete two trials for each span and their score is identical to the maximum of digits repeated without any error in one of the two trials. The second part is almost identical, except that participants have to repeat the span backwards, beginning with the last digit of the span. The lowest span contains two, and the highest eight digits. Here too, the score is equal to the maximum of digits repeated correctly. Forward and backward scores are added to obtain a total score, such that scores can range from 0 to 17. In the absence of tyrosine effect on this measure, as in earlier studies (e.g. 75), the average total digit span across two days was selected, because it was thought to provide a more reliable estimate of working memory capacity.</p><p>The total scores were averaged across the assessments and used as putative proxy of baseline dopamine function in exploratory analyses (see §2.6).</p></div>

The scale consists of 18 statements, which participants rate on a 5-point Likert scale ("extremely uncharacteristic of me" to "extremely characteristic of me"). Example statements include "I prefer complex to simple problems" or "I only think as hard as I have to". Scores range from 18 to 90.</p></div>

While the load effect is in line with earlier reports using this task, the latter amount effect was unexpected given that prior work has shown shallower discounting for larger rewards in both cognitive effort (16) and delay discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(80)</ref>. In addition to these manipulation checks for SV, we analyzed the speed by which choices were made.

Choice response time analysis revealed that tyrosine numerically increased overall response times, but the effect was not statistically significant (drug: F(1, 28) = 3.8, p = 0.060).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Individual differences: proxy measures of dopamine</head><p>Following earlier work indicating that catecholaminergic interventions depend on dopamine baseline levels (e.g. 1) and the recent study showing that motivation for cognitive control depended on participants' trait impulsivity scores (4), we explored whether tyrosine effects on SV varied as a function of trait impulsivity (BIS-11) and working memory scores (digit span). As in our recent methylphenidate study, tyrosine effects on SV depended on participants' trait impulsivity scores, evidenced by two correlations of medium effect sizes: Tyrosine administration resulted in steeper SV discounting (i.e. higher cost) as a function of N-back levels in more relative to less impulsive participants (r = -0.37; drug x impulsivity x level: F(1, 25) = 5.01, p = 0.034; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">Figure 5</ref>).</p><p>In addition to this level-dependent effect, tyrosine tended to also decrease the overall subjective Although we considered it unlikely that tyrosine could have altered N-back performance,</p><p>given the timing of the intervention, we tested this assumption by adding impulsivity (and digit span) scores as covariates to the N-back models. This analysis also allowed us to assess whether this impulsivity-dependent effect of tyrosine on effort discounting is an indirect consequence of an impulsivity-dependent effect on performance (e.g. reflecting error avoidance). As expected, given that the N-back task was performed before tyrosine levels were peaking, we did not observe such observed that the modulation of SV by tyrosine and impulsivity was no longer significant (drug x level x impulsivity: F(1, 19) = 3.1, p = 0.096). In sum, tyrosine enhanced the speed of difficult task performance in more impulsive participants, while also reducing their subjective value (or increasing the subjective cost) of difficult task performance. These findings suggest that the effects on SV do not reflect time-on-task avoidance, as faster instead of slower task performance was accompanied by lower SVs.</p><p>Finally, to assess whether the effect of tyrosine on cognitive effort discounting might reflect modulation of mood, we also assessed impulsivity-dependent effects of tyrosine on mood changes (total scores T1-T0), as assessed with the Bond and Lader analogue scale. Results of a repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant effects of tyrosine on mood changes (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>), also not as a function of impulsivity (drug x impulsivity: F(1,25) = 2.7, p = 0.115).  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In this study, we set out to assess whether a catecholamine precursor alters motivation of cognitive control in older adults. More specifically, we hypothesized that augmenting catecholamine synthesis with tyrosine increases the subjective value of performing the N-back task for money. For this reason, we employed an established economic discounting procedure (16) that has previously been shown to be sensitive to cognitive load and aging. Our aim was to investigate tyrosine's effect on decision-making about cognitive effort, rather than tyrosine's role in N-back performance. Therefore, participants were exposed to the N-back task right after drugintake (~20 min) at which point tyrosine should not have taken effect. Conversely, the effort discounting task was administered when catecholamine levels were expected to be enhanced.</p><p>In line with earlier reports, we observed that participants' performance decreased, and effort discounting increased, as a function of working memory load (i.e. N-back level)(16).</p><p>However, contrary to our prediction, tyrosine did not alter the subjective value of cognitive effort as a main effect. We predicted a positive main effect of tyrosine on motivation for cognitive control, given prior evidence linking increased dopamine function with willingness to expend physical effort in animal models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">81)</ref>, reduced physical effort discounting in humans (7) and neurocomputational models implicating striatal dopamine in increasing sensitivity to effort benefits versus costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(17)</ref>. Moreover, recent work has shown that increased dopamine might promote not just physical effort, but cognitive control as well, by offsetting effort costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">19)</ref>. We expected that older adults might be particularly sensitive to benefits of tyrosine administration, given reports on reduced dopamine transmission <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(32)</ref>  Instead of a main effect, we observed in exploratory analyses an interaction with individual differences such that tyrosine effects depended on participants' baseline impulsivity. Specifically, the (demand-induced) subjective value of control decreased with tyrosine administration in participants with high baseline impulsivity, while it was increased, if anything, in less impulsive participants. This interaction between drug status and impulsivity is a small effect, but interesting because it mirrors a similar interaction between the catecholamine agonist methylphenidate and impulsivity in our previous study that had greater statistical power to assess individual differences (n = 100) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. In that study, participants with low impulsivity showed neutral or even reduced avoidance of cognitive demand, while those with high baseline impulsivity increased demand avoidance when given methylphenidate. The present results constitute an important extension of this prior work in two ways. First, they provide a critical conceptual replication of the result that catecholaminergic interventions can alter willingness to expend cognitive effort as a function of impulsivity despite differences in task, drug, and population. Second, we utilized a discounting task which explicitly measures cost-benefit decision-making, allowing us to directly test the hypothesis that pharmacological catecholamine manipulation modulates the subjective value of cognitive effort. The methylphenidate-dependent effects on demand avoidance in the prior study were plausibly linked to cost-benefit decision-making. However, the inference was indirect given that 1) no explicit rewards / benefits were on offer, 2) demand avoidance may have reflected ability to detect demand differences rather than increased sensitivity to effort costs, per se (cf. 13) and 3) effort-execution (i.e. task-switching) in addition to choices were conducted on drug.</p><p>Our aim here was not only to extend previous work by teasing apart effort-execution and choices by administering them in two separate tasks, but also to show that tyrosine alters choices specifically without the possibility of performance modulation by having the N-back task performed off drug. Because of logistic reasons and plasma tyrosine levels reaching their peak level only after 90-120 minutes <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">38)</ref>, we administered the N-back task shortly after tyrosine administration. Surprisingly, performance analyses indicate an impulsivity-dependent response time modulation which is also consistent with effects observed after methylphenidate administration (4): Tyrosine attenuated level-related slowing in more impulsive participants. This finding evidences that, contrary to our expectation, tyrosine modulated performance as early as 20 minutes after tyrosine ingestion. Thus, as in the methylphenidate study, reduced motivation for cognitive effort (i.e. lower subjective value) on tyrosine was accompanied by level-dependent speeding, indicating, if anything, relatively better performance on the day of tyrosine administration. Although we remain puzzled by the fact that we observe any modulation of performance by tyrosine that early after administration, the direction of effect is not in line with a performance failure account. Self-report ratings of perceived effort support this interpretation, as ratings did not show (impulsivity-dependent) drug effects.</p><p>In sum, the two studies converge in suggesting that dopamine interventions affect motivation for cognitive effort as a function of trait impulsivity, with undermining effects in more impulsive participants. Individual differences in trait impulsivity have been associated with baseline dopamine transmission (22) and drug effects on reversal learning (73), working memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(82)</ref>, and striatal interconnectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(83)</ref> in young adult samples. As such, instead of finding a main effect, our findings align with the proposal that the effects of catecholaminergic drugs vary with individual differences in baseline levels of dopamine <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(23)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Why does tyrosine reduce SV in more impulsive participants?</head><p>One reason that tyrosine might have attenuated the subjective value of cognitive effort is by paradoxically decreasing dopamine synthesis and dynamic dopamine response to offer presentation for more impulsive individuals, via D2 autoreceptors. Thus, a reduction in dopamine synthesis might result in a shift towards more cost and less benefit sensitivity. Indeed, while phasic DA release following offer presentation makes decision makers more sensitive to offer benefits and less sensitive to offer costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">84)</ref>, autoreceptor binding can attenuate phasic DA release <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(85,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">86)</ref>. Thus, pharmacologically increased DA tone could, via increased autoreceptor signaling, reduce phasic DA release, making more impulsive decision-makers less willing to accept highcost, high-benefit offers. This account assumes that tyrosine administration primarily increased pre-synaptic (autoreceptor) rather than post-synaptic D2 binding in older adults and that impulsive individuals differ in their pre-synaptic signaling sensitivity. Supporting the first assumption, the administration of phenylalanine, the precursor of tyrosine, to rats increased striatal dopamine release at lower doses, but attenuated dopamine release at higher doses <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(87)</ref>. In line with this finding, there is evidence for up-regulated striatal dopamine synthesis in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(88,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">89)</ref>, which has been associated with impaired task-switching performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(89)</ref>. Thus, we speculate that a surge of precursor converted to dopamine in a system with already up-regulated dopamine synthesis may 'over-dose' the system triggering a shutdown of TH activity, via cytoplasmic dopamine or D2 receptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(90)</ref>. This would explain the observation that higher doses of tyrosine (both 150 and 200 mg/kg) were associated with reduced working memory performance compared with a lower dose <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(38)</ref>. In support of the second assumption, more impulsive individuals have lower presynaptic dopamine D2 receptor availability and greater amplitude phasic responses to instrumental cues at baseline (22). Thus, more impulsive individuals may be particularly sensitive to the consequences of dopamine agonism for autoreceptor signaling. In sum, this account predicts that tyrosine reduced dopamine in older adults and more impulsive individuals will see the largest paradoxical reduction in phasic dopamine release with dopamine agonists. This mechanism has elsewhere been posited to explain why the agonist methylphenidate can reduce impulsive responding in individuals with ADHD (91).</p><p>Another reason that increased dopamine tone might increase cognitive effort discounting, for some people, relates to striatal dopamine's putative role in regulating action selection as a function of opportunity costs. In short, dopamine tone has been proposed to convey local environmental richness, and therefore the opportunity costs of 'sloth' <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(92)</ref>. Thus, in the competition between cognitive control, and habits, higher dopamine tone conveying higher opportunity costs may promote an action selection bias for fast habits over slow control actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(93)</ref>. This effect of increasing dopamine on action selection may also influence explicit costbenefit decision-making about cognitive control of the type studied here <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(94)</ref>. Thus, individuals with high dopamine tone might be speculated to perceive their environment as particularly opportunity costly. In this context, tyrosine-related reductions in the value of cognitive effort as well as level-dependent speeding on the N-back task can be considered adaptive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>Our hypotheses were motivated by a robust literature on dopamine's role in physical effort and cost-benefit decision making. However, tyrosine does not selectively increase dopamine: Oral administration in young adults has been shown to also affect plasma noradrenaline levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(95)</ref>.</p><p>Future studies are needed to test the hypothesis that tyrosine alters motivation of cognitive control via affecting dopamine rather than noradrenaline transmission. This is especially pertinent because of the well-established link between the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system and mental fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(96)</ref> and the implication of this system in task-related decision processes (97), task engagement and meta-cognitive regulatory functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b113">(98,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b114">99)</ref>. Moreover, instead of a main effect of tyrosine administration on the subjective value of cognitive effort, we observe that tyrosine effects were modulated by trait impulsivity scores. Despite the fact that these results are consistent with our recent larger scale study (n = 100; 40), we are aware that the effect is small and that our sample of 29 participants is low. As such, replication of this effect is advised in a larger sample, ideally in which the effort execution takes place before any intervention is administered.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>We demonstrate that tyrosine administration altered the subjective value of cognitive effort in healthy older volunteers (aged 60 -75 years). However, contrary to our hypothesis that tyrosine alters overall valuation of the N-back task, exploratory analyses suggest an interaction between drug and individual differences in trait impulsivity. Interestingly, as in our recent methylphenidate study, tyrosine reduced the motivation for cognitive effort in more relative to less impulsive participants. Thus, we show that cost-benefit decision-making about task engagement is sensitive to changes in catecholamine synthesis and the direction of effect depends on individual differences in trait impulsivity, a putative proxy of baseline dopamine function.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>4) was on average 189 (+/-22) minutes, while plasma tyrosine levels have been measured to remain elevated up to 8hrs (see §2.3, 25).

Colchester, Essex, United Kingdom). The placebo product was a mixture of 54 mg/kg dextrine-maltose (Fantomalt by Nutricia) with 110 mg/kg maizena (ratio Fantomalt/cornstarch = ~½). The ratio of Fantomalt to cornstarch was adjusted to ensure that placebo and tyrosine mixture have an equal energy level, similar structure and aftertaste. Tyrosine and placebo powders were mixed with 200g of banana-flavored yoghurt (Arla Foods Nederland, Nijkerk, The Netherlands) to ensure comfortable ingestion. In a formal blinded sensory experiment, a specialized dietician from the Division of Human Nutrition of Wageningen University (E. Siebelink) confirmed equal taste experience of the two mixtures. Weighting of the doses, preparing and coding the samples were performed by a staff member not involved in the study, thus the order of administration was double-blind. Tyrosine is a catecholamine precursor: when tyrosine enters the brain via the blood-brain barrier, it is converted into levodopa through the rate-limiting enzyme tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH; Daubner, Le, &amp; Wang, 2011) and then further converted into dopamine through the enzyme aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC). In turn, dopamine can be converted into noradrenaline through the enzyme dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH; Jongkees et al., 2015; Kaufman &amp; Friedman, 1965). The oral administration of tyrosine significantly enhances central catecholamine synthesis in rodents (24,27,28,66-68) and humans</figDesc></figure>

Choices were self-paced but had a maximal duration of 9 s. After the choice is made, a box is presented around the chosen option for 0.75 s. If no response was given, the message "Too slow!" was presented for 0.75 s. Minimal trial duration was set to 2 s. C Per harder task level (triangle, square, diamond), 5 choices were presented with respect to circle (1-back) for a varying amount offered for the easy task. Hard tasks were either fixed at €2 or €5. Red bars show the decrement if participants always chose the easy task, while the green bars show the increment if always the hard task was chosen. Participants' choices thus vary in this range. The adjusted amount decreased as a function of trial number of the specific pair. The subjective value</figDesc></figure>

"Subjective value" (SV) hereafter refers to indifference points divided by the amount category (€2 or €5), such that all numbers ranged from 0 to 1 for both the low and high amount offers.

This corresponds to d'values of 2.02 and 2.03. In line with earlier work (16), performance was sensitive to the load manipulation: d' decreased as a linear function of N-back levels (level effect: F(1, 25) = 129.45, p &lt; 0.001; Figure 3A), while response times increased (level effect: F(1, 25) = 20.99, p &lt; 0.001; Figure 3B). As expected given our design, tyrosine had no main effects on performance, as assessed by d′ (drug effect: F(1,25) &lt; 0.01, p = 0.978) and response times (drug effect: F(1, 25) = 0.94, p = 0.342), or interactions with N-back level (for d′: drug x level interaction: F(1, 25) = 0.29, p = 0.596; for RTs: drug x level interaction: F(1, 25) = 2.86, p = 0.103). This lack of drug effects is not surprising, because participants performed the N-back task immediately after tyrosine administration, so brain tyrosine levels were unlikely to have risen at the time of the N-back task performance. Average performance data (d′ and RTs) as a function of level and drug are presented inTable 2. For a complete list of statistical effects, see Supplemental Material 7.</figDesc></figure>

Tyrosine also did not alter overall response times as a function of impulsivity (drug x impulsivity: F(1, 22) = 2.25, p = 0.148). However, surprisingly, tyrosine administration attenuated level-related slowing to a greater degree in more impulsive participants (drug x impulsivity x level: F(1, 22) = 4.86, p = 0.038). For a complete list of statistical effects, see Supplemental Material 7. To further exclude that the tyrosine-induced reduction in SV was driven by failure-avoidance in more impulsive participants, we assessed whether we could replicate the (significant) modulation of SV by tyrosine and impulsivity when including tyrosineinduced performance changes in the SV model. Note that this control analysis is based on 25 instead of 29 datasets due to missing N-back (n = 3) and impulsivity (n = 1) data and might thus also suffer from a reduction in power to detect an effect. Despite the smaller sample and the inclusion of (drug-induced) d'-scores, we replicated the effect of interest (drug x level x impulsivity: F(1, 19) = 4.8, p = 0.041), suggesting that an indirect modulation via failure (i.e. error) avoidance is unlikely. Given the (unexpected) observation of an impulsivity-dependent response time effect, we repeated this analysis when including drug-induced response time changes. Here we</figDesc></figure>

A Black dots represent per participant the difference scores (tyrosine minus placebo) of the slope of the subjective value as a function of N-back levels. Negative scores reflect more pronounced discounting (i.e. steeper subjective value slope) on tyrosine compared with placebo. The black line represents conditional means given the linear model used and shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval. The correlation between impulsivity scores and subjective value slope on placebo is r = 0.38, suggesting that more impulsive participants have a shallower reduction in SV as a function of increasing demand (i.e. N-back level). The correlation on tyrosine is r = 0.03. B Subjective value slopes as a function of drug. The horizontal line in the boxplots represent the median. Lines show the change in subjective value slope per subject, colour-coded for their trait impulsivity score, as a function of drug. Negative values on the y-axis indicate that SV decreases as a function of higher N-back levels: a steeper slope represents steeper discounting with respect to level 1.</figDesc></figure>

Also the perceived effort for completing higher N-back levels compared with level 1 increased linearly (F(2,54) = 71.1, p &lt; 0.001). Consistent with our expectation, given that the task and these questionnaires were administered only shortly after the intervention, we do not observe any modulation of perceived difficulty or effort ratings as a function of drug (drug effect for difficulty: F(1,27) = 0.1; for effort: F(1,27) = 0.8; for relative effort: F(1,27) = 0.8), also not as a function of level (drug x level for difficulty: F(3,81) = 0.8; for effort: F(3,81) = 0.9; for relative effort: F(2,54) = 1.4). When entering trait impulsivity scores as a covariate, unlikethe effect in the COGED paradigm, we do not observe any significant impulsivity-dependent drug effect on subjective effort ratings relative to the 1-back task, a measure most similar to the COGED task (drug x impulsivity: F(1,25) = 0.4, p = 0.539; drug x impulsivity x level: F(2,50) = 1.7, p = 0.198). This analysis strengthens the confidence that effects observed on the choice task are specific to the tyrosine intervention and were not observed on self-reported effort scores right after effort execution.</figDesc></figure>
