			<abstract>
				<p>Advice-taking plays a critical role in collaboration. Yet people tend to under-utilize advice, often to their own detriment. In this chapter, we investigate if people&apos;s utilization of advice improves when they know the advisor has access to different information compared to them. Across four experiments, we examine how individuals integrate advice in an estimation task, where the advisee and the advisor have access to different perspectives of the same problem. Experiment 1 evaluates participants&apos; independent ability to perform the task of estimating the number of objects in a jar from various viewpoints. The results show that depending on the type of objects, some viewpoints provide more accurate estimates than others. Experiment 2 confirms that participants are able to identify these more informative viewpoints. Building on these findings, Experiment 3 examines how individuals adjust their estimates when presented with estimates from a human advisor and an AI advisor. Individuals are also given information about the advisor&apos;s perspective. Our findings are consistent with egocentric discounting where individuals exhibit a general bias toward their own information. However, this discounting is lower for AI advisors compared to human advisors in our experiment. Our results also show that the advisor&apos;s estimate is taken more into account when the advisor has a more favorable viewpoint-for both human and AI advisors. This suggests a potential for optimizing advice-taking behavior by enhancing people&apos;s understanding of the advisor&apos;s viewpoint. This study furthers our understanding of advice-taking dynamics with human and AI advisors and the role of perspective-taking in decision-making processes.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Research on advice-taking reveals a common tendency: people undervalue suggestions from others compared to their own opinions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bonaccio &amp; Dalal, 2006)</ref> despite evidence that advice typically improves performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kämmer et al., 2023)</ref>. Concurrently, extensive research on overconfidence shows that people perceive their abilities as superior to those of their peers, exhibiting unwarranted confidence in themselves. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Moore &amp; Cain, 2007)</ref>. Working with AI is no different. Research has shown that humans are susceptible to a variety of misjudgements and biases when seeking advice from machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dietvorst et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Goddard et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Logg et al., 2019</ref>. As humans interface more with AI assistants, it is important to understand how they incorporate AI advice in their decisions. This combination of undervaluing advice and overvaluing personal judgment presents a significant challenge in decision-making and advice utilization. This combination of undervaluing advice and overvaluing personal judgment presents a significant challenge in decision-making and advice utilization.</p><p>Several explanations have been proposed to explain why people may underutilize advice. Some suggest that people fail to appreciate the benefit of incorporating diverse perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Larrick &amp; Soll, 2006)</ref>, while others attribute it to individual differences in agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Schultze et al., 2018)</ref> or narcissism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kausel et al., 2015)</ref>. A leading explanation for these tendencies in quantitative estimation tasks is egocentric discounting, a phenomenon where individuals underutilize external advice often due to factors such as asymmetric access to information <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Yaniv, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Yaniv &amp; Kleinberger, 2000)</ref>. It posits that individuals tend to favor their judgment over advice from others and struggle to accurately incorporate alternative viewpoints when evaluating advice. This is further confirmed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bailey et al., 2022</ref>) through a meta-analysis that shows people generally give more weight to their own estimates than to advice from others. Interestingly, some studies show that people are more likely to discount advice that differs from their initial beliefs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Himmelstein &amp; Budescu, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Yaniv &amp; Milyavsky, 2007)</ref>, while others show that advice that mirrors one's own beliefs is also discounted, being perceived as confirmation rather than new information <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Allahverdyan &amp; Galstyan, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Himmelstein &amp; Budescu, 2023)</ref>. These findings suggest a complex interplay where the difference between the advice and the advisee's initial beliefs may influence the advice-taking process.</p><p>Previous research also indicates that people place greater weight on advice when they perceive the advisor to be an expert based either on the advisor's demonstrated accuracy in prior tasks or on the advisor's presumed capability based on status <ref type="bibr">(Önkal et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Yaniv &amp; Kleinberger, 2000)</ref> also emphasize the dynamic nature of trust and the importance of advisor reputation on people's advice-taking behavior. However, these findings are grounded in scenarios where the advisee and the advisor do the same task and have access to identical information. In contrast, the key focus of our paper is how individuals integrate advice from others when the information available to the advisor differs from their own. Do people still exhibit egocentric discounting in such scenarios?</p><p>Does this preference for one's own judgment over others' advice indicate a failure in perspective-taking? Or do individuals possess the capacity to discern between various forms of advice, selectively incorporating them based on the relevance of the advisor's information?</p><p>Through a meta-analysis, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bailey et al. (2022)</ref> found that the information about the quality of advice was the most significant predictor of advice-taking. In contrast, the key focus of our paper is to investigate if people can strategically alter their reliance on the advisor depending on the quality of information the advisor has. In particular, we investigate how visual perspective-taking influences advice integration in a visual quantity estimation task. Research on visual perspective taking has demonstrated that people are capable of accurately predicting the visual experience of other agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Michelon &amp; Zacks, 2006</ref>). However, it is unclear if this ability extends to advice integration, especially when the advisor has a superior vantage point to address a particular problem. Our research probes the interplay between egocentric discounting and perspective-taking in the context of advice integration. Through a series of experiments, we examine how individuals integrate the advisor's estimate when individuals have knowledge about the quality of information available to the advisor.</p><p>In our experimental setup, an individual, referred to as the advisee, is tasked with estimating the number of objects in a jar, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. They are then provided with the estimate made by another individual, the advisor, regarding the same jar's contents. This setup mirrors a judge-advisor system (JAS) a widely used framework in decision-making research <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bailey et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Himmelstein &amp; Budescu, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Önkal et al., 2017)</ref>, where a judge initially makes a judgment and then has the chance to revise it after receiving advice. Unlike traditional JAS setups, our experiment presents the advisor and advisee with different views of the jar. These distinct viewpoints make the process of counting the objects more or less challenging.</p><p>The implications of our research extend beyond the scope of our experiments. They are relevant in various real-world contexts, including decision-making assisted by AI systems and collaborative problem-solving. The increasing prevalence of AI in decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Grgić-Hlača et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Patel et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Steyvers &amp; Kumar, 2022)</ref> necessitates understanding the interaction between humans and AI advisors. This includes exploring different workflows, such as making AI advice always available or available only on demand to improve the efficacy of assisted decision-making. Advances in explainability methods also play a critical role in demystifying AI decisions for users <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Ignatiev, 2020)</ref>.</p><p>In the following sections, we present details about and insights from three experiments that seek to answer the following questions: Can the advisee, when informed about the advisor's view of the jar, accurately assess the difference in favorability between their view and the advisor's? When given the opportunity to revise their estimate, do individuals appropriately integrate the advisor's assessment into their estimation? How does people's weighting of advice differ across human and AI advisors? Furthermore, do individuals make optimal decisions based on who possesses the more advantageous view? Finally, we discuss the broader significance of this research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview of Experiments</head><p>The goal of our experiments is to assess advice-taking in situations where there is information asymmetry between the advisor and the advisee. We conduct three experiments to explore this theme. In all three experiments, the primary task is to estimate the number of objects in a jar, a classic task used to study the psychology of number estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bevan et al., 1963)</ref> and conformity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jenness, 1932</ref>). To facilitate this task, we create stimuli consisting of images of jars containing varying quantities of cylinders, disks, or spheres. Each jar may be viewed from five different angles, as shown in  The estimates are made independently without any advisor. We use the estimates from Experiment 1 as advisor estimates in Experiment 3. In Experiment 2, we assess individuals' ability to identify the most favorable jar view for estimation to establish that individuals are capable of understanding the circumstances where another person would have better quality of information. Experiment 3 examines how advisees integrate advice given the advisor's view of the jar.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stimuli: Generating Synthetic Images of Object-filled Jars</head><p>The images of jars used in the experiments were created using the Python interface of the Blender software <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Blender, 2022)</ref>. Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset often used for creating animated films, visual effects, and motion graphics. To capture different viewpoints of jars corresponding to the different 'views' accessible to the advisor and the advisee, we designed a standard jar using Blender and placed it in a virtual studio setup available on the platform. Next, we added five cameras to the scene: one positioned horizontally in front of the jar (0 • ), another looking down from the top (90 • ), and three placed in between (22 • , 45 • , 66 • ). We generated three distinct objects-spheres, cylinders, and disks-that were placed inside the jar. These objects were purposefully selected to create perspectives that are differentially favorable for counting each type of object. For instance, the side view is optimal for counting disks, whereas the top view works better for counting cylinders. The number of objects in each jar was randomly determined, falling within specified ranges of 50 and 1000 for spheres, 5 and 200 for cylinders, and 5 and 50 for disks. Finally, to virtually place the objects in the jar, we leveraged Blender's physics engine to simulate the dropping of objects into the jar. Five cameras captured snapshots of the jar once the objects were settled in their final positions in the jar. The Python code to create the stimuli is available on https://osf.io/zxftv/.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Figure 2</head><p>Illustration of the stimuli across viewpoints (columns) and types of objects (rows). For each type of object, the images show the jar with the same number of objects in the same configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>One hundred participants were recruited from Prolific. Using Prolific prescreening requirements, we restricted the participant pool to individuals living in the United States who had a minimum approval rate of 90%. The age of participants ranged from 20 to 71 years, with a mean age of 38.95 years and a median age of 36 years. Participants were predominantly male (61%) with the remaining 39% identifying as female. Participants from Prolific received $3.00 for their participation and $1.50 for good performance.</p><p>Participants were expected to take 15 minutes to complete the study. We pre-registered this study at https://osf.io/zjx86. The experimental protocol was approved by the University of California, Irvine Institutional Review Board.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>The stimuli consisted of 150 images: 3 types of objects (spheres, cylinders, and disks) x 5 viewing angles x 10 jars with different numbers of objects. Each jar may be observed from five viewing angles, which include a top view (90 • ), side view (0 • ), and</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">intermediate views (22 • , 45 • , 66 • ).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Each subject was assigned the task of estimating the number of objects in 30 jar images. For each trial, participants were instructed to estimate the number of objects contained in the jar in the image displayed. Participants provided their estimates in a text field, which accepted only numeric input. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>To evaluate participants' estimation error for different images, we computed the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for each viewing angle and shape combination. If X is the true number of objects in a jar, and X i is person i's estimate of the number of objects in that jar, the MAE for that trial is |X − X i |. Across the three experiments, we used a logarithmic transformation to standardize participants' estimates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Figure 3 shows participants' mean estimation error for each shape and viewing angle. Notably, for cylinders, estimation error decreases as the viewing angle of the jar increases. The opposite pattern is observed for disks, where estimation error increases with the viewing angle. For spheres, the results reveal a non-monotonic and U-shaped trend with the intermediate angles having a lower estimation error than 0 and 90 degrees. In comparison to disks and cylinders, estimation error and variance for spheres are considerably higher. This higher error in estimation can be attributed to the larger number of spheres in the stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Chesney et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Our findings indicate that participants exhibit reasonably good performance in the estimation task, with higher errors for less favorable viewpoints and lower errors for more favorable viewpoints.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2: Identifying the best view for estimating the number of objects</head><p>One potential reason for egocentric discounting in advice-taking situations is the challenge of considering another person's perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Yaniv &amp; Choshen-Hillel, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Experiment 2 tests whether people can recognize which view of a jar will yield the most accurate estimate and, as a result, understand the differences in information quality when an advisor has a different perspective than the advisee. Experiment 2 results will be used in Experiment 3 to distinguish between favorable and unfavorable advisor views.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Two hundred participants were recruited from Prolific. The prescreening requirements were the same as in Experiment 1. The age of participants ranged from 18 to 69 years, with a mean age of 35.155 years and a median age of 32 years-52% participants identified as female, and 47% as male. Participants from Prolific received $2.00 for their participation and $1.00 for good performance (i.e., if their performance is within the top 30% across all participants). We pre-registered this study at https://osf.io/bzvuf.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials</head><p>The stimuli consisted of the same jar images as Experiment 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>Each participant completed a total of 30 trials. On each trial, participants were tasked with predicting which of two views of the same jar would lead to the most accurate estimate. For each participant, the order of the 30 unique jar images was randomized. The first view of the jar, referred to as 'View A', was chosen out of the 5 views. The second view, or 'View B', was chosen from the 4 remaining views. The combination of views across A and B was counterbalanced such that there were approximately 10 judgments per unique view combination. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1 (b)</ref> illustrates the experiment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>To quantify the relative preference of View B over View A, we calculate the preference probability for View B. Suppose the number of people who chose View A is X, and the number of people who chose View B is Y .The preference probability for View B is then evaluated as Y X+Y . This metric helps us understand how likely participants are to prefer View B over View A.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Two hundred participants were advised by another human and seventy five participants were advised by an AI. Participants were recruited from Prolific. The age of participants ranged from 19 to 70 years, with a mean age of 39.66 years and a median age of 37 years-predominantly male (66%), and 33% identifying as female. The prescreening requirements were the same as in Experiment 1. Participants received $3.00 for their participation and $1.50 for good performance (i.e., if their performance was within the top 30% across all participants).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Procedure</head><p>On each trial, participants first submit an independent estimate of the number of objects in the jar as shown. Next, participants are shown the advisor's view of the jar and the advisor's estimate based on their view as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1(c)</ref>. Participants are required to provide a final estimate, with the option to integrate information from the advisor's estimate. Each participant in Experiment 3 was paired with a randomly selected advisor from Experiment 1. The participants in Experiment 3 viewed the same jar as the advisor, but their view of the jar could be different or the same. The views of the participants were counterbalanced so that there were approximately 8 estimates for each jar-view image pair between the participant and the advisor. Each advisor from Experiment 1 was yoked with a total of 2 participants in Experiment 3. During the experiment, participants are warned to slow down their estimation process if they take fewer than 7 seconds for an estimate or fewer than 3 seconds for their estimation revision.</p><p>If the participant gets more than three warnings, the participant will be rejected from our research, and the data will be excluded from our analyses. In addition, participants who failed to successfully complete instructions quiz twice will be removed from the data post-hoc, if they choose to retake the study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis</head><p>Weight of Advice. Weight of Advice (WoA) is measured by how much the advisee's estimate shifts towards the advice given, proportionally to the difference between their original belief and the advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bailey et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Himmelstein, 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hogarth &amp; Einhorn, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Soll &amp; Larrick, 2009)</ref>. WOA typically has a trimodal distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Soll &amp; Larrick, 2009)</ref>, with spikes at 0 (advice declined) and 1 (advice adopted). WoA (w) can be understood through a simple mathematical relationship involving the initial estimate of the advisee (c), the estimate provided by the advisor (p), and the revised estimate of the advisee after receiving the advice (r). The revised estimate of the advisee is a weighted average of the advisee's initial estimate and the advisor's estimate:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">r = wp + (1 − w)c w = r − c p − c<label>(1)</label></formula><p>WoA measures how much the advisee's estimate shifts towards the advisor's estimate relative to their initial estimate. If the advisee ignores the advisor's advice, WoA is 0, and if the advisee fully adopts the advisee's estimate, WoA is 1. WoA thus provides a precise way to assess the influence of advice on an individual's decision-making process.</p><p>We utilize WoA as a metric to infer participants' reliance on the advisor's estimate. To handle negative and extreme WoA values, any empirical WoA less than 0 was clipped to 0, and any value greater than 1 was clipped to 1. Each of the three regression models was applied separately to each object shape.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Bayesian Regression</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>We used a logarithmic transformation to standardize participants' estimates. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relative Favorability of Views Modulates Weight of Advice</head><p>Each of the three regression models was applied separately to each object shape.</p><p>The results of this analysis are presented in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>. The Bayes Factors represent the relative evidence of the Relative Favorability model over the two null models (Advisor and Advisee View). For both the Disks and Spheres, the results provide substantial evidence In summary, our findings reveal that participants tend to base their advice-taking decision on the relative favorability of views instead of solely relying on their view or the advisor's view of the jar.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Difference between Observed and Optimal Weight of Advice</head><p>In this section, we investigate to what extent participants are optimal in their weighting of advice. To excel in the advice-taking task, an ideal participant would need to adjust their weight of advice to minimize their estimation error. The optimal WoA would also have to take into account the combination of advisor and advisee views.</p><p>To formalize the analysis of optimal WoA, we introduce some notation. For each trial i in a collection of n advisor-advisee view combination trials, let t i be the true number of objects in the jar, p i be the advisor's estimate, c i be the advisee's initial estimate, and w be the weight of advice. The participant's objective is to minimize:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">min (t i − (w i p i + (1 − w i )c i )) 2</formula><p>which gives us a closed-form expression for the optimal weight of advice for trial i, w opt i (for a detailed derivation, see Appendix ??):</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">w opt i = t i − c i p i − c i<label>(2)</label></formula><p>. <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref> illustrates the comparison between participants' observed and optimal weight of advice for different preference probabilities for both human and AI advisors. Our findings reveal two distinct, consistent patterns across all shapes. Similar to empirical</p><p>WoA, to handle negative and extreme optimal WoA values, any optimal WoA less than 0 was clipped to 0, and any value greater than 1 was clipped to 1. This indicates that individuals tend to assign less weight to the advisor's estimate than would be considered optimal. This reflects a bias where participants are inclined to favor their estimates over those of the advisor, even though it negatively impacts their performance. However, note that this discounting is lower for the AI advisor compared to the human advisor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Collaboration often involves seeking and incorporating advice from others. However, research on advice-taking consistently reveals that people tend to under-utilize the advice they receive <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bailey et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bonaccio &amp; Dalal, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kämmer et al., 2023)</ref>.</p><p>Traditional experimental studies in this domain have largely focused on scenarios where the advisee and advisor engage in repeated interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Schultze et al., 2017)</ref> and have access to identical information <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Yaniv &amp; Choshen-Hillel, 2012)</ref>. In contrast, our research takes a novel approach by investigating how individuals process and integrate advice when they are aware that their advisor has access to distinct information. The central idea of our study is that people are able to evaluate the relevance and utility of the information available to the advisor for a specific task, enabling them to make informed adjustments in their reliance on advice.</p><p>In this paper, we conducted three experiments to examine participants' performance in a simple, yet challenging visual counting task. This task, inspired by everyday experiences, involves estimating the number of objects in a jar from various perspectives.</p><p>From Experiment 1, we learned that participants were better at the estimation task when shown some views of the jar compared to others. This is intuitive -some perspectives of the jar obstruct critical information. For example, a top view of the jar with spheres obscured the depth of the objects, impacting the accuracy of people's estimates.</p><p>Experiment 2 confirmed that people's intuitions were correct -people preferred views of the jar which led to lower estimation errors in Experiment 1. Finally, in Experiment 3, we presented another person's estimate and view of the jar as additional information that participants could use to improve their estimates. Our analysis revealed that participants adjusted their initial estimates to incorporate the advisor's estimate, with the degree of adjustment or weight of advice increasing when the advisor had a more favorable view of the jar. This suggests participants' nuanced understanding of how different perspectives can influence the accuracy of estimates.</p><p>Our findings align with previous advice-taking research, revealing a persistent trend of 'egocentric discounting'. Despite recognizing the value of the advisor's differing perspective, individuals exhibit a bias towards their own information. This highlights an opportunity for further optimizing advice-taking behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Yaniv and Choshen-Hillel (2012)</ref> show that prompting participants to predict another person's perspective can initially reduce egocentric discounting, this effect diminishes when participants revert to their own perspective. They propose using perspective-taking as a corrective measure for egocentric discounting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kämmer et al. (2023)</ref> also explored factors contributing to egocentric discounting, highlighting that decision-makers know the reasons for which they hold their own opinions, but they may lack insight into their advisor's opinions. This information asymmetry can contribute to egocentric discounting. Our study reinforces these insights, showing that providing information on why advisors hold their opinions can mitigate egocentric discounting, although it may not completely eliminate it.</p><p>Understanding the dynamics of advice-taking and egocentric discounting can significantly improve decision-making processes, ultimately enhancing the quality of collective judgments and facilitating more effective collaboration. While our work contributes to a deeper understanding of these dynamics, several aspects remain unexplored. One key limitation of our study is the absence of feedback from participants during the experiment. In real-life scenarios, feedback plays a crucial role in refining one's understanding of both the advisor and the task, allowing for adjustments in mental models based on actual outcomes. Future research should look into whether and how feedbackeither after each trial or in aggregate -affects individuals' strategies in weighting advice.</p><p>Additionally, our study does not examine the interaction between the overall proficiency of the advisor at the task and their access to differential information. Therefore, one important empirical extension, which we leave for future research, is to look at how people account for advisor reputation when incorporating advice, especially in scenarios with varying levels of information availability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Open Practices Statement</head><p>All data and stimuli from this study are accessible on the Open Science Framework:</p><p>https://osf.io/zxftv/. All three experiments were preregistered. Preregistration reports are Adopt, Revise, Decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Himmelstein (2022)</ref> proposed a descriptive theoretical model that suggests a discrete 'choosing' stage in advice utilization, where the advisee decides either to decline, adopt, or compromise with the advisor's advice. In line with this framework, we categorized the participants' final estimates in our experiment into three distinct actions: adopting, declining, or revising the advice received during each trial.</p><p>We visualize participants' adopt, revise, and decline decisions in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure A1</ref>, which reveals interesting patterns of how participants responded to advice across different shapes and viewing angles. Specifically for Disks, a notable trend emerges: when an advisee's viewing angle is lower than the advisor's viewing angle, a majority of participants decline the advisor's advice. In contrast, when the advisor's viewpoint is lower than the participant's, the number of participants adopting advice increases substantially as does the number of participants revising advice.</p><p>Compared to Disks, Spheres, and Cylinders have a greater proportion of participants who revise their estimates. For cylinders, there is a clear correlation between the advisor's angle and the likelihood of participants either revising or adopting the advice;</p><p>as the angle of the advisor increases the proportion of participants who revise and adopt advice increases. For spheres, the proportion of participants who decline advice is greater when the advisor angle is not intermediate. This inclination to decline advice is especially pronounced for 90 • angle for the advisor. Across all shapes, a consistent pattern is observed when the viewing angles of the advisor and advisee are aligned: each shape displays a similar distribution of decisions to adopt, decline, or revise the advice. For each trial i in a collection of n advisor-advisee view combination trials, let t i be the true number of objects in the jar, p i be the advisor's estimate, c i be the advisee's initial estimate, and w be the weight of advice. The participant's objective is to minimize:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">min (t i − (w i p i + (1 − w i )c i )) 2</formula><p>Expanding the square, the expression becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">min t 2 i − 2t i (w i p i + (1 − w i )c i ) + (w i p i + (1 − w i )c i ) 2</formula><p>To find the minimum, we differentiate this expression with respect to w i and set the derivative to zero. Differentiating yields the following expression:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">d dw i t 2 i − 2t i (w i p i + (1 − w i )c i ) + (w i p i + (1 − w i )c i ) 2 = 0 −2t i (p i − c i ) + 2(w i p i + (1 − w i )c i )(p i − c i ) = 0</formula><p>Rearranging terms, we obtain:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">w i (p i − c i ) 2 = (t i − c i )(p i − c i )</formula><p>Solving for w i gives us the optimal weight of advice for trial i, w opt i :</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">w opt i = t i − c i p i − c i</formula></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 2: 0 • (side view), 22 • , 45 • , 66 • (intermediate viewing angles), and 90 • (top view). Our choice of shapes is deliberate, such that different viewpoints of the jar are advantageous for estimating the number of objects based on the specific characteristics of the object's shape. For example, as shown in Figure 2, the top view (90 • ) allows for counting the cross-sections of cylinders but gives no information about the depth of spheres or disks. Conversely, the side view (0 • ) is favorable for counting disks but is not suitable for spheres or cylinders.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_4"><head>Figure 4</head><label>4</label><figDesc>illustrates participants' view preferences. Darker shades of blue indicate a stronger preference for View B over View A. Notably, for cylinders, darker cells are primarily clustered below the diagonal. In this region, as the angle of View A increases, the cells in each row transition from a darker to a lighter shade. This result shows that participants not only favor views with larger angles but also exhibit a stronger preference when the difference between the two viewing angles is larger.Conversely, for disks, the dark blue cells are concentrated above the diagonal. The shade of this area is darker and more homogeneous compared to the lower triangular area of the cylinder. This shows that participants have a strong preference for lower angles, and the difference between the angles of View B and View A does not strongly impact the magnitude of this preference.Finally, for the spheres, cells tend to be darker when View B is at a more intermediate angle compared to View A. In addition, the top view (90 • ) is less preferred over any other viewpoint, presumably because participants intuit that the top view leads to ambiguities in the overall count. Overall, the results show that participants favor viewing angles that lead to lower estimation errors (as established in Experiment 1) and have an intuitive understanding that some viewpoints lead to lower quality information. Experiment 3: Integrating advice from a human or an AI advisor with a different perspective Experiment 3 investigates how participants evaluate, process, and use the inputs provided by an advisor when they are presented with information regarding the advisor's viewpoint. In one condition, participants are presented with a human advisor's estimates (from Experiment 1). They are tasked with using this advice to formulate their own estimates, aiming for maximum accuracy. The experiment manipulates the perspective of the jar available to the advisee and advisor. In another condition, participants receive estimates from an AI advisor, along with information about the AI's viewpoint of the jar.</figDesc></figure>

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_1"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>The key question in this study is whether participants take into account the advisor's view relative to their own view when weighting the advisor's estimate. We investigate this question by examining three regression models that aim to predict the Weight of Advice (WoA) based on various types of information about the advisee and advisor perspectives. Bayesian linear regression models were used to compare different models of how individuals determine the weight of advice based on their own and the advisor's viewpoint. All models encoded the independent variables as categorical variables. The Relative Favorability model allows for the possibility that the WoA is dependent on the relative favorability of the advisor and advisee views. The model represents relative favorability based on the preference probability derived from Experiment 2. We divided the preference probabilities into three categories: less than .33 (advisee view is preferred over advisor view), between .33 and .66 (no clear preference for advisor or advisee view), and greater than .66 (advisor view is preferred over advisee view). The Advisee View model assumes that only the advisee view predicts the WoA and ignores the advisor view (e.g., the advisee may rely more on the advisor if their view is less favorable regardless of whether the advisor has a favorable view). Similarly, in the Advisor View model, the only determinant of WoA is the advisor's point of view and ignores the advisee's point of view.We used the BayesFactor package<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Morey et al., 2018</ref> in R to implement the models and to calculate the Bayes factor, a metric for assessing the strength of evidence in Bayesian Statistics. Bayes Factors allow us to quantify the evidence supporting each model relative to others.</figDesc><table /><note>Models.The goal of this model is to determine how people's preferences for the advisor's point of view influenced the weight they assigned to the advisor's estimate. The second and third models both function as null models.</note></figure>

These results are similar to the performance of participants in Experiment 1, where the mean absolute errors were .12, .16, and .43 for the same shapes. Notably, when participants had access to an advisor's estimate, in the human advisor condition, their errors reduced to .10, .11, and .36 and in the AI advisor condition, their errors reduced to .09, .10, and .36 for cylinders, disks, and spheres.
