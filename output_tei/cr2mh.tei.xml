			<abstract>
				<p>Behavioural and cognitive flexibility allow adaptation to a changing environment. Most tasks used to investigate flexibility require switching reactively in response to deterministic taskresponse rules. In daily life, flexibility often involves a volitional decision to change behaviour. This can be instigated by environmental signals, but these are frequently unreliable. We report results from a novel &apos;change your mind&apos; task, which assesses volitional switching under uncertainty, without the need for rule-based learning. Participants completed a two-alternative choice task and following spurious feedback, were presented with the same stimulus again. Subjects had the opportunity to repeat or change their response. Forty healthy participants completed the task whilst undergoing a functional MRI scan. Participants predominantly repeated their choice but changed more when their first response was incorrect or when feedback was negative. Greater activations for changing were found in the inferior frontal junction, anterior insula, anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Changing responses were also accompanied by reduced connectivity from the anterior insula and orbitofrontal cortices to the occipital cortex. Using multivariate pattern analysis of brain activity, we predicted with 77% reliability whether participants would change their mind. These findings extend our understanding of cognitive flexibility in daily life by assessing volitional decision-making.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Cognitive flexibility is defined as the ability to adapt to changes in the environment by switching task sets, responses, or strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cools, 2015)</ref>. From a psychological perspective, it is often considered alongside related emergent control processes such as inhibition and updating <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Miyake et al., 2000)</ref>. Flexibility allows changing behaviour in response to environmental and internal cues. Individuals with greater cognitive flexibility have improved life outcomes, better social functioning and reduced cognitive decline with age <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Burke et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Diamond &amp; Lee, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Koesten et al., 2009)</ref>. Difficulties in flexibility have also been observed in several mental health conditions, further highlighting the importance of research on the neural and psychological bases of flexible behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chamberlain, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Remijnse et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Yerys et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>A full understanding of cognitive flexibility has proven challenging, in part because this is not a unitary construct <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dias et al., 1996)</ref>. Various behavioural paradigms have been developed to measure flexibility in humans, each capturing intersecting but somewhat different aspects of this behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dajani &amp; Uddin, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Milner, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Roberts et al., 1988</ref>). Common paradigms encompass task-switching, attentional set-shifting and reversal learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brown et al., 2015)</ref>. In task-switching procedures, the participant switches between two or more tasks, based on pre-defined stimulus-response sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Manoach, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Monsell, 2003)</ref>. Set-shifting tasks such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the CANTAB intradimensional/extradimensional test or the Dimensional Change Card Sort task <ref type="bibr">(DCCS)</ref> measure the ability to transition between cognitive-attentional sets, in the case of the WCST by using external cues to learn about rules determining ongoing performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chamberlain, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Grant &amp; Berg, 1948)</ref>. Reversal learning, on the other hand, requires participants to adapt responding following the reversal of previously learnt reward-related contingencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Izquierdo et al., 2017)</ref>. The diversity within cognitive flexibility is exemplified by distinct Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind developmental trajectories for different tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Buttelmann &amp; Karbach, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kalkut et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Somsen, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Van Der Schaaf et al., 2011)</ref>. In studies involving both task-switching and set-shifting paradigms, the salience and executive control networks (ECN) are consistently activated <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Dajani &amp; Uddin, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Uddin, 2021)</ref>. Key nodes in the former include the anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) whereas the ECN includes the inferior frontal junction (IFJ), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Braun et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hampshire &amp; Owen, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Shine et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vaghi et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Connectivity between the AI, dACC and thalamus, forming the cingulo-opercular network, in addition to the posterior parietal cortex is widely reported in task-switching <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dosenbach et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Liston et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Worringer et al., 2019)</ref>. While the neural substrates of taskswitching and attentional set-shifting overlap, the former is associated with greater parietal and thalamic involvement and the latter with the default mode network (DMN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">(Vatansever et al., 2016)</ref>. Reversal learning, on the other hand, activates somewhat different circuits, including the striatum, amygdala, the medial PFC, and the lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Izquierdo et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Remijnse et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>Cognitive control more generally has been increasingly recognised to employ proactive and reactive modes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Braver, 2012)</ref>. Applying this distinction to cognitive flexibility may be useful with task-switching paradigms often focusing on reactive flexibility, with switching being triggered by explicit external signals. Proactive control, on the other hand, anticipates the need for control and is thought to be mediated in part by the lateral PFC (lPFC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Braver et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Mäki-Marttunen et al., 2019)</ref>. Both reactive and proactive control involve ventrolateral PFC and AI node activations, though only proactive control engages the DMN <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Ryman et al., 2019)</ref>. In contrast, reversal learning and attentional set-shifting paradigms characteristically capture both reactive and proactive flexibility, with shifting Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind being both prepared and elicited by feedback in participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Rogers et al., 2000)</ref>. There are additional key procedural differences between the common instantiations of these paradigms. For example, many task-switching procedures include similar proportions of switch and repeat trials, whereas most reversal learning and behavioural set-shifting procedures employ fewer shifts (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Dodds et al., 2011)</ref>). Less frequent task relevant events elicit the salience network <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Wager et al., 2004)</ref>. Additional procedural distinctions include the extent of rule learning during the task and presentation of feedback or rewards to signal a need to change, both of which are less prominent in task-switching paradigms <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kiesel et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>In daily life, flexibility often involves a change in behaviour being generated endogenously, but in situations where rule learning or set-shifting is not required. Here, we report results from a 'change your mind' task, where participants performed two-alternative forced choices and following spurious feedback, viewed and responded to the same stimulus again. Critically, they could repeat their previous response or change it, acting of their own volition. To our knowledge, no existing task provides participants with the opportunity to repeat their choice and assess whether they subsequently choose the 'road not taken'. We propose that the ability to change one's responses constitutes a form of mental flexibility not fully explored within current conceptual frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Uddin, 2021)</ref>. Here, forty healthy participants completed the task whilst undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning. We expected subjects to change their second response when their first response was incorrect or when feedback was negative, and that any effects of spurious feedback would decrease with time. Based on previous studies, it was hypothesised that PFC salience and ECN nodes (i.e., AI, dACC, IFJ, IFG and dlPFC) would be active when participants volitionally 'changed their minds'.</p><p>Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants</head><p>Participants were 40 healthy volunteers (21 females), aged between 18 and 60 years (Mean=31.88, SD=10.03), recruited from adverts in the Cambridge community and from the University of Cambridge Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute volunteer panel.</p><p>None of the participants had any history of psychiatric or neurological disorders. All participants provided informed written consent and were reimbursed for their time and travel expenses, with ethical approval granted from the Cambridge Local Research Ethics Committee (08/H0308/65).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Task Procedure</head><p>Participants performed a two-alternative forced choice task, determining whether a target letter was 'T' or 'L' (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>). The task consisted of paired trials, each of which included an identical stimulus display following a fixation ('1' or '2') denoting whether this was the first or second of the pair. The target letter was embedded in a row of Xs and masked after a brief delay. Participants were informed that after the first of each pair the computer will provide feedback but that the feedback may not always be 100% accurate. Instructions stated that immediately after the feedback the same trial will be presented again and that they would have a chance to change their mind on the second display should they wish.</p><p>Unbeknown to participants, feedback was orthogonal to performance and was monitored so that it was negative on half of accurate trials and positive on half of the incorrect trials.</p><p>Participants completed 56 pairs of trials in each of three runs, 48 of which were difficult and 8 were easy. On each trial, following a 500 ms fixation period, the target was briefly presented within a row of eight Xs in grey in the centre of the screen. Following a predetermined delay, the target was replaced with an 'X'. Target location was Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind counterbalanced, appearing in one of the 6 or 4 central locations on difficult or easy trials, respectively. On difficult trials, a staircase determined target duration, initially set to 60 ms and decreasing by 10 ms following a correct response and similarly increasing following an incorrect response. On easy trials, target duration was fixed at 150 ms. The stimuli displayed for 2 seconds, and participants responded by pressing one of two buttons on a custom buttonbox with response mappings counterbalanced across participants. Following 1 to 3 seconds (duration randomly selected at 100 ms intervals), feedback appeared for 1 second ('+ correct +' in green or 'x wrong x' in red). After another interval (1-3 seconds), the second fixation appeared, followed by the same stimulus display and an intertrial interval (1-2.5 seconds).</p><p>This procedure allowed for 6.2 seconds on average between the two responses of each pair.</p><p>Participants completed 12 practice pairs before entering the scanner. Trial order per block was randomised and the experiment was programmed in Visual Basic. After responding, participants received feedback that was orthogonal to their performance.</p><p>Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind This was followed by an identical second stimulus presentation. The first and second of each pair were denoted by fixation appearing as the numeral '1' or '2'. Event durations are shown to the left of the task representation.</p></div>

Linear mixed-effects models (LMEs) were fit with feedback (positive or negative), response 1 accuracy (R1: correct or incorrect), run (1-3) and all interactive terms as factors in R (R Core Team, 2017, version 4.0.4) using the lme4 package <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bates et al., 2015)</ref>.

Various LMEs were tested that included different random intercepts and were subsequently compared using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and log likelihood. The LME including a random Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind intercept for each subject and run had the lowest scores across all three measures and is thus reported here.

Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Zhang et al., 2001</ref>). Functional MRI data was slice-time corrected using slicetimer (FSL) and motion corrected using mcflirt (FSL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jenkinson et al., 2002)</ref>. Distortion correction was performed using field maps processed with fugue (FSL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Jenkinson, 2003)</ref>. This was followed by co-registration to the corresponding T1w image using boundary-based registration with six degrees of freedom, using flirt (FSL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Greve &amp; Fischl, 2009)</ref>.

Four ROIs were created based on the findings from the first analyses, as well as areas reported to mediate proactive cognitive flexibility in previous studies. The regions that were selected for PPI analysis included the caudate nucleus, anterior insula (AI), orbitofrontal cortex <ref type="bibr">(OFC)</ref> and superior frontal gyrus (SFG). A 5 mm sphere was placed in the respective region based on the Harvard-Oxford Atlas.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multivariate Pattern Analysis</head><p>A Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) employing a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was used to predict whether participants would change their minds or repeat their response during R2. The MVPA was run on non-normalised and unsmoothed data to reduce distortions and conducted using nilearn and sklearn in Python 3.6 (Abraham et al., 2014; <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Pedregosa et al., 2011)</ref>. The MVPA was based on the whole-brain individual beta maps obtained from the univariate analysis, more specifically, the beta maps for feedback, R1, and beta maps for the two categories were combined by concatenation. The SVM applied a linear Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind kernel using a fixed regularization parameter (C = 1). K-fold cross-validation was performed using a leave-one-out cross-validation. For each cross-validation iteration, the data were partitioned by run into smaller training and test datasets. Classifier performance was evaluated using: (1) the F1 score, (2) the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and (3) classification accuracy. Maps visualising decoder weights showed which areas contributed to classifying whether the subject would change or repeat their choice on the subsequent stimulus presentation.</p></div>

With negative feedback, an increase in the frontal pole, occipital pole and cerebellum was also seen <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table 2)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multivariate Pattern Analysis: predicting changing one's mind</head><p>Using an MVPA approach, we tested whether it is possible to predict whether participants would change or repeat their response. R2 change could be predicted from brain activity during R1, presentation of feedback, as well their combination. Analyses using R1 beta coefficient maps yielded an accuracy of 0.64 predicting R2 change, and those using the feedback resulted in an accuracy of 0.74. When R1 and feedback were combined, performance was superior with an accuracy of 0.77. For comparability, LME model accuracy for behaviour was 0.70. contributing to classifying whether participants would repeat or change their response <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">(Fig.   S4</ref>). Based on R1 activity, voxels contributing to R2 classification encompassed the cingulate, caudate, putamen, inferior and middle frontal gyri, frontal pole, occipital cortex, with additional voxels distributed throughout the brain. When the feedback beta maps were used, areas involved in classification included the AI and OFC, as well as the SFG, paracingulate gyrus, cingulate gyrus, caudate and frontal pole. <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 4</ref>. Summary of performance metrics for the MVPA analysis.</p><p>Performance of three analyses is compared. In the first, classification was based purely on the beta maps from the first response.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>This study investigated behavioural and neural correlates of proactive cognitive flexibility, where participants adjusted their behaviour voluntarily. Specifically, we assessed flexibility under conditions that did not involve trial-and-error rule-based learning or switching between multiple task-rules or attentional sets. Instead, participants were allowed a 'do-over', illuminating a perspective on flexibility not fully captured to date. Using paired trials in an uncertain environment, participants decided whether to change or repeat their response in the second of each pair. Accuracy of performance for the first of each pair was only slightly above chance, indicating that uncertainty was high. As expected, participants were more likely to change their response following presentation of the second stimulus when the first response was incorrect and when feedback was negative.</p><p>ACC activation during the first response, particularly when incorrect, is consistent with previous studies which identified this region along with the SFG as key structures involved in error and action monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bonini et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Botvinick et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Carter et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lie et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Van Veen et al., 2001)</ref>. Electrophysiological evidence from primates has shown that ACC neurons not only respond to errors, but also signal prior to adjustments following an error, thereby contributing to selection of the next movement <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Shima &amp; Tanji, 1998)</ref>. Further, ACC neuronal activity reflects a behavioural shift on the subsequent trial in a reversal learning task <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kawai et al., 2015)</ref>. Lesioning or inactivating this area impairs the ability to adjust choice behaviour after negative outcomes in both experimental animals and humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">(Williams et al., 2004)</ref>. Studies in humans have focussed on neural correlates of error signalling or detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Ullsperger et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Van Veen &amp; Carter, 2002)</ref>. The present findings complement these by focusing on the subsequent behavioural adjustment, where strong ACC and SFG activations were detected, i.e., on the instantiation of flexibility through a change on the second response. This indicates the importance of the ACC during the implementation of behavioural adjustments, which has hitherto received less attention in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Ridderinkhof et al., 2004)</ref>. The ACC and SFG involvement also demonstrate the inherent conceptual overlap between error monitoring and flexibility in some everyday situations, with the former leading to the latter.</p><p>In line with other studies of behavioural shifting, we report recruitment of PFC regions of the ECN and salience network (e.g., IFJ, IFG, AI, ACC and dlPFC) during response change <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Braun et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dajani et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Shine et al., 2016)</ref>. The IFJ is thought to mediate response shifting by integrating multiple behavioural control processes and interactions with the dlPFC, vlPFC, AI and putamen, additional evidence for which is provided by our findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cole &amp; Schneider, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Levy &amp; Wagner, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Sundermann &amp; Pfleiderer, 2012)</ref>. The AI and IFG, on the other hand, are both important for response inhibition, and contribute in dissociable ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cai et al., 2014)</ref>. The former is functionally coupled with the ACC and is important for salience detection of unexpected or infrequent events. Involvement of the AI is unlikely to be due to the detection of an unexpected stimulus as in the case of inhibition in stop signal or go/no-go tasks. Instead, given that changing was more infrequent than staying, it may be associated with the salience of an internally generated infrequent action. The IFG has stronger connectivity with the dlPFC as part of the ECN and facilitates appropriate behavioural control <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cai et al. 2014)</ref>. The recruitment of both the AI and IFG may be attributable to inhibition of the first response, highlighting the intrinsic role of inhibition in purposeful flexible adjustment of behaviour. Unlike previous studies investigating flexibility, we also observed activity in the frontal pole in both change and repeat conditions, with greater activations during the former. This may represent a volitional component of our task, as this area has been associated with processing of internal states and self-generated responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Christoff et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Ramnani &amp; Owen, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Tsujimoto et al., 2010</ref>).</p><p>Our psychophysiological interaction analysis provided additional insight into the brain circuits underlying repeating or changing a response. With the AI as the seed region, there was stronger connectivity to the lateral occipital cortex and occipital pole in the former condition. This was also the case for the connectivity from the OFC to the occipital pole, lingual gyrus, and occipital fusiform gyrus. Further, occipital pole activation increased over time during the second response. A recent automated meta-analysis of cognitive shifting, updating and inhibition highlighted not only the importance of prefrontal regions, but also the angular gyrus and visual cortex, whose role in cognitive flexibility is often overlooked <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Uddin, 2021)</ref>. Reports from multiple task-switching studies further confirm the involvement of occipital regions such as the lateral occipital cortex <ref type="bibr">(Armbruster et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Dajani et al., 2020)</ref>. In mice, ACC projection neurons to the visual cortex important for error monitoring have been directly linked to post-error behavioural adaptation through fibre photometry and optogenetic manipulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Norman et al., 2021)</ref>. In humans, a causal dependency between the frontal operculum and occipitotemporal regions in cognitive control has also been demonstrated using transcranial magnetic stimulation, suggesting top-down regulation of visual areas by the AI and frontal operculum <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Higo et al., 2011)</ref>. Whether occipital areas in our task were solely activated due to the stimuli being visual is unclear. Nevertheless, our findings support an involvement of the AI/OFC and connections to occipital regions in flexible cognitive control.</p><p>Over time, participants changed their responses less following negative feedback, suggesting they learnt it was unreliable. This was accompanied by increased activity over time in the dorsal striatum during feedback presentation, regardless of valence, in addition to the increased activity in the occipital cortex during the second response mentioned above.</p><p>These findings are compatible with the established role of the dorsal striatum in behavioural and cognitive control, decision-making under uncertainty and signalling ambiguity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Hsu et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Lopez-Paniagua &amp; Seger, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Mestres-Missé et al., 2017)</ref>. Thus, the dorsal striatum has been found to estimate outcomes and adjust behaviour when there are deviations from expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mestres-Missé et al., 2014)</ref>. Specifically, the dorsal striatum and its connections with cortical regions such as the CEN are necessary for overriding previous responses that are no longer useful; instead, implementing more appropriate responses given the current environmental context <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Den Ouden et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Mestres-Missé et al., 2014</ref>.</p><p>Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind Caudate nucleus activation has been shown to correlate with response selection, rather than feedback presentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hiebert et al., 2017)</ref>. Here, the increased dorsal striatal activity during feedback presentation over time likely reflects its involvement in using ambiguous information to update the individuals' response selection, a finding that has not been reported in previous studies.</p><p>MVPA is increasingly used to increase the information gained from fMRI data <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Weaverdyck et al., 2020)</ref>. In the present study, when feedback was presented, the algorithm could predict the participants next action with an accuracy of 77%. As the prediction of behaviour from performance data in this tightly controlled situation was 70%, the BOLD voxel-wise approach enhanced the predictive properties of the data. Decoder weight maps highlighted voxels in the AI, OFC, frontal pole, SFG, cingulate gyrus and caudate as strongly contributing to predicting a change response on the subsequent stimulus presentation. These results indicate that brain activity prior to an action encode contributors to the decision that will be made, in our case, representing antecedents to changing one's mind.</p><p>This study created high uncertainty via brief stimulus presentation times and spurious feedback. Though effective in eliciting participants to change their minds, the task could not dissociate specific contributions of internal versus external sources of uncertainty. Future studies may disentangle these or explore alternate contributors to shifting representative of everyday situations. The task does assist with some difficulties encountered by the impurity problem, which makes it difficult to untangle joint and separable aspects of executive processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Miyake et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Uddin, 2021)</ref>. Namely, a challenge in studying cognitive flexibility has been to isolate it from working memory and attention demands. These processes were likely kept constant in the change vs repeat contrast, with the task having minimal spatial and rule learning requirements. Future studies could employ the same task with auditory stimuli to verify modality independent involvement of key PFC nodes.</p><p>Neurobehavioural correlates of changing one's mind Moreover, this could reveal whether occipital region activation is due to the visual nature of most flexibility tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Niendam et al., 2012)</ref>. Ultimately, the present findings widen our view of flexibility in everyday life by allowing a targeted assessment of volitional decisionmaking.</p></div>
