			<abstract>
				<p>New bionic technologies and robots are becoming increasingly common in workspaces and private spheres. It is thus crucial to understand concerns regarding their use in social and legal terms and the qualities they should possess to be accepted as &apos;co-workers&apos;. Previous research in these areas used the Stereotype Content Model to investigate, for example, attributions of Warmth and Competence towards people who use bionic prostheses, cyborgs, and robots. In the present study, we propose to differentiate the Warmth dimension into the dimensions of Sociability and Morality to gain deeper insight into how people with or without bionic prostheses are perceived. In addition, we extend our research to the perception of robots. Since legal aspects need to be considered if robots are expected to be &apos;co-workers&apos;, for the first time, we also evaluated current perceptions of robots in terms of legal aspects. We conducted two studies: In Study 1, participants rated visual stimuli of individuals with or without disabilities and low-or high-tech prostheses, and robots of different levels of Anthropomorphism in terms of perceived Competence, Sociability, and Morality. In Study 2, participants rated robots of different levels of Anthropomorphism in terms of perceived Competence, Sociability, and Morality, and additionally, Legal Personality, and Decision-Making Authority. We also controlled for participants&apos; personality. Results showed that attributions of Competence and Morality varied as a function of the technical sophistication of the prostheses. For robots, Competence attributions were negatively related to Anthropomorphism. Perception of Sociability, Morality, Legal Personality, and Decision-Making Authority varied as functions of Anthropomorphism. Overall, this study contributes to technological design, which aims to ensure high acceptance and minimal undesirable side effects, both with regard to the application of bionic instruments and robotics. Additionally, first insights into whether more anthropomorphized robots will need to be considered differently in terms of legal practice are given.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction to Social Perception of Embodied Digital Technologies</head><p>Social Perception influences social interaction in societies <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Cuddy et al., 2008)</ref>. Hybrid societies include human actors and Embodied Digital Technologies (EDTs). These societies are not a thing of the distant future anymore. Bionics users are becoming common, as are robots in workspace settings.</p><p>The perception of these new kinds of actors, and their subsequent roles and acceptance within a society, is the focus of current studies.</p><p>The Stereotype Content Model (SCM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Fiske et al., 2002)</ref> identifies Warmth and Competence as the two major dimensions of Social Perception and stereotyping. Social groups can be categorized on these dimensions, for example, housewives are perceived as warm, but incompetent, while feminists are perceived as cold, but competent <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Fiske et al., 2002)</ref>. In the context of hybrid societies, Meyer</p><p>and Asbrock <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(2018)</ref> showed that bionic prostheses affect attributions of Warmth and Competence towards their users. When using bionic prostheses, the perception of people with disabilities changes.</p><p>They regain perceived Competence while maintaining the warmer perception of people with disabilities without bionic prostheses. Users of bionic technologies who aim at augmenting their capabilities rather than at restoring functionalities are sometimes described as cyborgs. Cyborgs are perceived as colder and more competent than their purely human counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Meyer &amp; Asbrock, 2018</ref>).</p><p>In the current manuscript, our aim is to not only replicate these findings, but also to extend them to the perception of robots. We see the step from cyborgs to robots as an abstraction. Where cyborgs are inherently human, robots lose these qualities. The absence of these qualities affects their perception in terms of Warmth and Competence, and subsequently, their acceptance. This is important mainly within the context of workspaces. The number of robots is steadily increasing, e.g., from 18 800 in 2010 to 30 000 in 2020 for Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">(Statistisches Bundesamt, 2021)</ref>. Industrial settings were the first areas where robots were utilized to assist and, in some cases, replace human workers <ref type="bibr">(Ben-Ari &amp; Wischniewski (2019)</ref> point out that users may likely perceive themselves as inferior while using an exoskeleton when fulfilling their daily work routines. Wearing an exoskeleton may also lead to stigmatization in the workplace because the user appears dependent on a technological artifact to coworkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Gilotta et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Peters &amp; Wischniewski, 2019)</ref>. In short, the use of bionic technologies can affect stereotypes towards their users and is also likely to affect interpersonal perceptions on the individual and group level.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Social Perception of robots</head><p>Bionic devices are highly likely to be prevalent in the near future. Robots have become increasingly common in workspaces and will be expected to act as 'co-workers' <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Demir et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, robots will be introduced into private spaces. This presupposes that people want and accept robots in their homes. To be accepted, robots need to possess certain qualities. Whether these qualities can be derived from qualities human beings possess or are attributed is still under debate and needs further consideration. Prior research on the Social Perception of robots using the Robotic Social Attributes Scale (RoSAS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Carpinella et al., 2017)</ref> showed that traits similar to the humane perceptions of Warmth and Competence can be ascribed to robots. Both dimensions are also the most important predictors for human preferences concerning different robot behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Scheunemann et al., 2020)</ref>. Especially in industrial settings, robots are seen as social entities and attributed positive and negative humanlike characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Sauppé &amp; Mutlu, 2015)</ref>. Perception of robots are also influenced by other aspects such as its design or size <ref type="bibr">(de Visser et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Li et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Rosenthal-von der Pütten, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Schaefer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">von der Pütten &amp; Krämer, 2012)</ref>. Industrial robots might be exempt from this since their appearance needs to conform to measures of safety and usability <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Gesmann-Nuissl, 2019)</ref>. Whereas anthropomorphic features elicit greater trust <ref type="bibr">(de Visser et al., 2016)</ref>, too close resemblance to actual human beings might have the opposite effect. The uncanny valley phenomenon <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Mori et al., 2012)</ref> describes how extraordinarily human-like robots are PERCEPTION OF EMBODIED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES PREPRINT 7 perceived. Mostly, they are seen as rather eerie and elicit feelings of uneasiness or threat. Therefore, the question of 'how human-like is too human-like' is not trivial at all and needs closer inspection.</p><p>We see this study as groundwork to investigate which qualities a robot should posess to be an accepted partner in a hybrid society. Hence, we focus on the expanded Stereotype Content Model, and investigate whether or not inherently humane properties can be attributed to robots. Against the background of increased research focused on moral machines (Awad et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bigman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Cervantes et al., 2020)</ref>, we assess Morality to examine if and to what extent people are willing to attribute Morality to robots. Acceptance of robots is not solely explained by the robots' appearance or behavior, but also by a persons' preference and the subsequent appliance of it. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Davis, 1989</ref>) is a theoretical model of how characteristics of computerbased information systems influence user acceptance and subsequent use of these systems. The model considers external variables, such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use which influence the attitude towards and behavioral intention to and actual use of a system. It points out that both usefulness and ease of use is founded within the user <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Davis, 1989)</ref>. This implies that personality factors might be associated with how well a system, in our case a robot, is integrated into workspaces and subsequently into society, but necessarily also in the legal system.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Individual differences in Social Perception</head><p>We considered a broad range of personality variables associated with the perception of others. Since we are assessing the perceived Morality of others, we considered personality factors which were shown as core variables to be associated with moral behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Strobel et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Affinity for Technology Interaction (ATI) is the tendency to actively engage in intensive technology interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Franke et al., 2019)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PERCEPTION OF EMBODIED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES</head><note type="other">PREPRINT 8</note><p>Technology Acceptance Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Davis, 1989)</ref>. It can be assumed that people high in technological affinity have a clearer picture of what a robot can or cannot do. Technological orientation is connected with Robot Acceptance at Work (RAW) through two factors: on an individual level, for example, daily internet use at work, and on a national level, for example, larger mobile phone ratio <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Turja &amp; Oksanen, 2019)</ref>. Affinity for Technology Interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Franke et al., 2019)</ref> and Need for Cognition <ref type="bibr">(NFC;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Cacioppo &amp; Petty, 1982)</ref>, as well as computer experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Dijkstra et al., 1998)</ref>, are moderately to strongly positive correlated. Need for Cognition is defined as the tendency of an individual to engage in and enjoy thinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cacioppo &amp; Petty, 1982)</ref>. Need for Cognition has a strong impact on the perception of Anthropomorphism of robots. People high in Need for Cognition tend to anthropomorphize less than people low in Need for Cognition. This is due to differences in the accessibility of egocentric information. Individuals higher in Need for Cognition more readily apply nonanthropomorphic attributions while those, lower in Need for Cognition, rather use anthropomorphic attributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Epley et al., 2007)</ref>. This results in differences, especially when attributing characteristics of Agency, Sociability, and Animacy to robots <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Spatola &amp; Wykowska, 2021)</ref>. Need for Cognition and Openness are investment traits. They determine where and in which amount people invest cognitive effort over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">(von Stumm, 2013)</ref>. When interacting with robots, the personality trait of Openness should be considered influential. Individuals high in Openness are, for example, inquisitive about various domains of knowledge, and take an interest in unusual ideas or people <ref type="bibr">(Ashton &amp; Lee, 2009)</ref>. Openness facilitates the interaction with robots in such a way that it significantly correlates with robot-led cognitive testing of elderly people <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Rossi et al., 2020)</ref>. This suggests that by being receptive to new ideas and experiences, the novelty of robots triggers curiosity rather than anxiety.</p><p>Possible associations between personality variables and acceptance of robots is a rather new topic. At this background, we decided to include not only Openness as a dimension of the HEXACO model <ref type="bibr">(Ashton &amp; Lee, 2009)</ref>, but to investigate all dimensions (i.e., Honesty-Humility, Emotionality, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, and Openness) on an exploratory basis. By using the HEXACO model <ref type="bibr">(Ashton &amp; Lee, 2009)</ref>, we can include the Big Five Personality Dimensions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">McCrae &amp; Costa, 1987)</ref> and the dimension of Honesty-Humility. Honesty-Humility is associated with moral aspects. The initial implication of Openness as being curious about new things can be widened to being open and willing to emphasize with others. Empathy describes the ability to understand and react adequately to others <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Paulus, 2009)</ref>. Empathy includes the subfacets Perspective Taking (i.e., being able to change psychological perspective spontaneously), Fantasy (i.e., being able to empathize with fictional characters), Empathic Concern (i.e., compassion and worry for people in need), and Personal Distress (i.e., self-focused emotional reactions). Higher levels of Empathy are linked to the tendency to perceive robots as fellow social agents rather than unfeeling machines <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Mattiassi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Rossi et al., 2020)</ref>. Links between familiarity with and empathic responses to robots were proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Mattiassi et al., 2021)</ref>. Justice Sensitivity describes how people vary in how easily they perceive injustice and how strongly they react to it. These differences are stable across time and different situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Schmitt et al., 2009)</ref>. Justice Sensitivity covers four perspectives:</p><p>Victim Sensitivity, Observer Sensitivity, Beneficiary Sensitivity, and Perpetrator Sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beierlein et al., 2014)</ref>. Differences in Justice Sensitivity could also have implications for what legal competencies people associate with robots. Moral Identity is one kind of social identity people use to construct self-definition which in turn is associated with moral action <ref type="bibr">(Aquino &amp; Reed, 2002)</ref>. Moral</p></div>

Hence, we investigated if there is an association between personality variables and the perception of people with physical disabilities who use lowtech prostheses, people with physical disabilities who use bionic prostheses, and able-bodied individuals in terms of a) Competence, b) Sociability, and c) Morality (RQ2).</p><p>Furthermore, we expanded these research questions to robots to evaluate their current perception in general. We evaluated how robots with varying levels of Anthropomorphism were perceived in terms of a) Competence, b) Sociability, and c) Morality (RQ3) and whether there was an association between personality variables and the perception of robots with varying levels of Anthropomorphism in terms of a) Competence, b) Sociability, and c) Morality (RQ4).</p><p>Since this is one of the first studies to approach robot perception with mostly humane attributions, we evaluated whether uniquely humane adjectives could be used to describe robots with varying levels of Anthropomorphism (RQ5).</p><p>The sample was acquired via Prolific academic (www.prolific.co), an online survey platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Palan &amp; Schitter, 2018)</ref>. We conducted a pilot study (N = 30) to assess the mean processing time. By including a manipulation check, we were able to exclude participants who did not read the instructions carefully and of whom we would expect their data to be flawed. Three participants did not meet the requirements of the manipulation checks and were therefore excluded, resulting in a final sample size of N = 459. We checked for outliers that were specified at having rated the social dimensions outside of +/-three standard deviations from the mean and ran analyses twice: once by including and once by excluding the outliers. We composed items to cover the three main dimensions Competence, Sociability, and Morality, as well as Anthropomorphism, rated on a five-point Likert scale.</p></div>

We evaluated general attributions on the aforementioned social dimensions and investigated possible interactions of inter-individual differences on these attributions.</p><p>Users of low-tech prostheses were seen as less competent than those of high-tech prostheses. This is in line with our Hypothesis 1 (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Meyer &amp; Asbrock, 2018)</ref>. Perceived Sociability was independent of Restored Functionality. This is surprising since ratings of Warmth, which are higher for people with disabilities, were subsumed under the umbrella of Sociability. We find this interesting since perceived Morality was higher for people with disabilities, regardless of whether they used low-or high-tech prostheses. Industrial robots were perceived as more competent than more anthropomorphized robots. Industrial robots were furthermore ascribed less Sociability than PERCEPTION OF EMBODIED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES PREPRINT 22 more anthropomorphized robots. Morality did not differ for types of robots. In general, individuals were reluctant to attribute inherently human characteristics such as Morality and, to some extent, Sociability to robots. We found small correlations between attributions of Competence, Sociability, and Morality and Emotionality, Empathic Concern, Perspective Taking, and Internalization for human beings.

In a comparable civil law constellation between human actors, the gap in responsibility of the legally represented person is bridged by the acting person. This is currently inconceivable in the case of robots. If at all, they should only be regarded as having partial legal capacity. This means that they could only be legally capable insofar as this is necessary for the applicability of the attribution rules of agency law and contractual liability for damages <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Riehm, 2020)</ref>. For this reason, the category of the e-person is discussed, which could be placed next to the natural and legal person. A distinction has to be made between Legal Personality and legal capacity. The e-person as a digital legal entity could participate in a legal transaction, have their assets, and be the addressee of legal obligations.</p><p>Due to their legal capacity, an e-person would be able to be the bearer of rights and obligations under civil law. In addition, they would be capable of exercising fundamental rights from a constitutional perspective, and be capable of committing criminal acts (Open Letter to the European Commission Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, 2021). In principle, legal capacity is based on the assumption that personal status is reserved for natural persons. This raises another problem: the legal capacity of legal persons in the German legal sphere is based on the fact that a natural person is ultimately in charge <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Riehm, 2020)</ref>. This is different from Anglo-American law, where legal capacity is necessary</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PERCEPTION OF</head><note type="other">EMBODIED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES PREPRINT 25</note><p>So far, discussions on the topic of robot rights have focused on the question of whether robots should have rights in a moral, and a next step in a legal sense. This poses questions of who will be granted which rights under which conditions and how these rights will be imposed. The question of who is primarily focusing on the type of robot. In many cases, literature explicitly deals with 'social robots' <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Tavani, 2018)</ref>. This category was defined as physically embodied agents which communicate and interact with humans on a social level <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Darling, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Darling, , 2016</ref>. By employing this definition, industrial and service robots, as well as softbots, (e.g., software), are excluded. Here, too, the major effect of Anthropomorphism needs to be considered. Due to physicality, perceived autonomous movement, and social behavior, these robots are viewed as potential social interaction partners. They are therefore more likely to have rights attributed to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Darling, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Turkle, 2012)</ref>.

By following this idea, it becomes apparent that as soon as the capabilities can be affirmed, the question of ought would also have to be answered positively. Only after theoretically affirming the attribution of any rights, the question of how needs to be considered. In particular, this poses the problem of how we, as human beings, can know whether a robot should be able to prove that it has the necessary characteristics to be granted rights.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PERCEPTION OF EMBODIED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES</head><p>PREPRINT not in direct contact with robots. Therefore, they might not be able or willing to assess robots in an unbiased way. As <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Naneva et al. (2020)</ref> pointed out, there is evidence that attitudes towards robots or cyborgs are currently based on fiction and threatening images (e.g., The Terminator; <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Cameron, 1984)</ref> rather than facts or objective reality, respectively. This assumption is also strengthened by recent research based on intergroup relations. Sarda Gou et al. <ref type="formula">2021</ref>showed that direct contact with robots positively affected participants' explicit and implicit attitudes toward robots. Direct contact might also be the crucial factor in why we found rather reserved attributions to robots while people working with robots attribute positive and negative human characteristics to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Sauppé &amp; Mutlu, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Further studies should address whether differences in perception persist if people work with robots or not and whether perceptions in work settings can be conferred to social settings. We assume that attitudes towards and emotions evoked by robots will become more realistic and objective in the long run. Longitudinal studies should be conducted to assess and monitor those changes. In comparing Study 1 and Study 2, it is notable that the percentage of individuals who ascribed social attributions to robots changed. Fewer people ascribed moral or sociable capacities to robots if they were shown in close succession with human beings rather than when the stimuli only contained robots. We suggest that this might be due to robots being perceived as the other <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Gunkel, 2018)</ref>, and therefore making ascriptions of social dimensions harder.</p></div>

To conclude, we found evidence that personality variables are associated with Social Perception, but, especially for the area of robots, further research is needed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Legal Perception of robots</head><p>Currently, discussion about granting robot rights, and the basis necessary for it, is conducted by experts from various fields, legislative institutions, and their advisors. Therefore, we investigated whether the participants associate typical legal attributions with the stimuli. We focused on two PERCEPTION OF EMBODIED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES PREPRINT 39 concepts: Legal Personality and Decision-Making Authority. We selected only these two legal concepts as they relate to natural persons. In the future, other categories may be added, such as the issue of tort capacity. To what extent robots may have human characteristics and to what extent they might also have legal capacity is currently the subject of a multi-layered debate. The discussion on rights for robots is focused on social robots, as by <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Tavani (2018)</ref> or <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Darling (2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Darling ( , 2016</ref>. They only deal with the category of robots that communicate and interact on the social level. This definition of social robots as physically embodied agents that communicate and interact with humans on a social level <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Darling, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Darling, , 2016</ref> excludes industrial and service robots as well as softbots (e.g., software)</p><p>from the grant of rights. The results of our study can be cautiously interpreted as partly supporting this assumption. Overall, participants were neutral to dismissive to agree with the statements which indicated Decision-Making Authority for robots. Within this range, more anthropomorphic robots were attributed more Decision-Making Authority. Similar to what was described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Darling (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Tavani (2018)</ref>, there is a tendency that the more human-like a robot looks and is perceivably programmed, the more they are seen as capable of making legally relevant decisions corresponding to humans. Therefore, they are seen as proficient in this respect. This might be caused by the fact that we, as humans, project our characteristics onto other human-like beings. Therefore, we feel more comfortable with granting them a certain legal standing. Nonetheless, further research is needed. If such a result is indeed confirmed on the long run, it would have meaningful implications for the use of robots. If the ascription of Decision-Making Authority is not in focus, anthropomorphic appearance is not necessary. But if this authority is of importance (e.g., in advertising), then the appearance should be considered. The same is true for the ascription of Legal Personality to robots.</p><p>Participants were neutral to dismissive to agree that robots could possess Legal Personality. Within this range, more anthropomorphized robots were perceived as more eligible for Legal Personality.</p><p>Previous research agrees that once a robot has certain inherent abilities that are human-like, especially if they have some sort of consciousness, they should also be granted rights <ref type="bibr">(Coeckelbergh,</ref> PERCEPTION OF EMBODIED DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES PREPRINT 40 2010; <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Gunkel, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Singer &amp; Sagan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Sparrow, 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">Sparrow, , 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b100">Tavani, 2018)</ref>. While Bryson (2019) considers robots as tools, or the basic legal capacity is denied (Open Letter to the European Commission Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, 2021), a trend can be observed that this is confirmed with regard to industrial, but less so for social and android robots. From this, it can be deduced that in a further legal discussion about robot rights, the similarity to humans must be included. This has to be done at a more sophisticated level than has been the case to date to increase the acceptance of new regulations. Keeping the aforementioned limitation in mind, these results indicate that there might be an association between levels of Anthropomorphism and acceptance of robots as members of a hybrid society in a legal sense. This applies to both appearance and the internal possibility of making decisions that ultimately have a legal effect. These aspects should be taken into account in the justification of new interpretations of norms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Limitations</head><p>The present studies are not without limitations. For one, we evaluated the Social Perception of robots and individuals with and without physical disabilities with low-and high-tech prostheses in a relatively straightforward way by presenting unmoving pictures. Research has shown that the existence of movement plays a role in how robots are perceived <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kupferberg et al., 2011)</ref>. This is why we see the present research as the first step towards a better understanding of the Social Perception of robots. We will take into the field as a subsequent next step. Pictures of individuals are highly influenced by personal taste. We decided on presenting pictures of actual human beings, so they differed in their physical appearance and might have influenced their perception. We refrained from using the RoSA Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Carpinella et al., 2017)</ref> to measure the Social Perception of robots and instead used scales from the Godspeed Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bartneck et al., 2009)</ref>  Anthropomorphism of the Godspeed Inventory <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Bartneck et al., 2009)</ref> were shown to load on the same factor. Nevertheless, the core dimensions of Social Perception are unaffected by this decision <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Scheunemann et al., 2020</ref>). Since we were dipping into a new field of research with employing legal questions in a survey setting, scales will need revision to provide a more conclusive insight. One should therefore interpret the results on Legal Perception of robots cautiously. Furthermore, technical issues accounted for the loss of one item of the scale for Legal Personality, which had a detrimental effect on the interpretability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusions</head><p>The present study shows that perceptions of Competence and Morality of users of prostheses varies as a function of technical sophistication of the prostheses. Conversely, we did not find any differences in perceived Sociability. The Social Perception of robots is strongly dependent on the perceived Anthropomorphism of the specific robot. This is not to say that robots can be easily ascribed humane attributions. Some attributes, for example, in terms of Competence or Sociability, can be used to describe both humans and robots. For more abstract terms like moral perceptions, a difference is made between humans and robots. In general, the public is reluctant to see robots as personalities in a psychological and legal sense. Therefore, we infer that at the present time, robots are not perceived as equivalents to 'co-workers'. This might change with greater availability of anthropomorphized robots. To sum it up, despite the downfalls, we can present new insights into a field which, in the future, will be of great importance for researchers and society alike.</p><p>Watson, S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(2018)</ref>   Note.

Additionally, we examined perceptions concerning legal aspects which have to be considered if robots shall become members of hybrid societies. This issue has been recognized by European institutions. They extensively discussed the question of how the EU and its member states could deal with this development. They discussed to establish an electronic person status and to define specific rights and obligations which should be granted to, or imposed on, robots. This is especially necessary because, with the growing autonomy of robots, they need to be seen less as tools than as agents (Resolution of the European Parliament, 2018/C 252/25). The connections that need to be established to identify a responsible party in case of error are often unclear and current existing concepts are no longer sufficient<ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Laukyte, 2019)</ref>. Law in general, or legal institutions specifically, are challenged in a new way by advanced technologies<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Calo, 2015)</ref>. To address this development, two major dimensions of Legal Perception need to be considered: Legal Personality and subsequent Decision-Making Authority.Legal Personality is a mandatory condition if robots are to become part of society. The term describes legal capacity. Legal capacity is the ability to be the bearer of rights and obligations. The law takes a person's Legal Personality and legal capacity for granted. Hence for now, Legal Personality is restricted to human actors. An extension to robots is discussed controversially. At present, robots arguably do not possess the capacities and attributions necessary to be considered as full moral or legal persons<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Darling, 2012</ref>). There is a major reason why legal scholars are discussing whether robots should have rights, and why legislators need to consider this question. That is that a responsibility gap emerges when autonomous, intelligent robots act erroneously. Suppose a robot is</figDesc><table /><note>4.1 Dimensions of Legal Perception:</note></figure>

This was independent from whether people wore prostheses of any type or not. Empathic Concern, as well as Observer Sensitivity and Perpetrator Sensitivity are moderately correlated, as is Emotionality with these three variables. This might point to a specific disposition of They might tend to ascribe more positive attributions to other people. Internalization, the degree to which a persons' private views are centered on moral traits(Aquino &amp; Reed, 2002), might be interpreted in a similar direction. For robots, associations between personality variables and attributions of social dimensions differed between Study 1 and 2. In Study 1, no associations were found. We consider that by mixing human and robotic stimuli, we made the differences between the two subgroups more salient. Attributions were, therefore, more conservative. This was reflected in the low number of participants who decided to attribute Sociability or Morality to robots. In Study 2, only robotic stimuli were presented. Slightly more participants attributed Competence, Sociability, and Morality to robots, even though we still interpret these results carefully. Higher Internalization, as was true for the human subgroup of Study 1, was associated with higher overall attributions of Competence and Sociability. This could be interpreted in such a way that this personality trait is important for any attribution really, independently from who or what it is attributed to. Attributions of Sociability were correlated with Affinity for Technology Interaction and Need for Cognition. Higher positive interest in technical gadgets and subsequently in the interaction with robots (de Graaf &amp; Ben Allouch, 2013) leads to more attributions of human adjectives to robots.
