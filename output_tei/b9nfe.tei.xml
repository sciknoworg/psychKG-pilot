			<abstract>
				<p>Drawing on literature linking bipolar disorder to both creativity and heightened motivation, our aim was to examine whether heightened motivation might contribute to creativity in those with and without bipolar disorder. To examine this, we recruited persons diagnosed with bipolar disorder (n = 49), and persons with no diagnosis of bipolar disorder (n = 37), with over-sampling of those from creative occupations. We gathered measures of lifetime creative accomplishment (Creative Accomplishment Questionnaire), willingness to persist as a creativity task became increasingly difficult (the Compound Remote Associates task) divergent thinking (Unusual Uses Test), selfrated high ambitions (The Willingly Approached Set of Statistically Unlikely Pursuits scale)) and a behavioral measure of willingness to exert physical effort for reward (the Effort Discounting Task). In multiple linear regression models controlling for age and examining the unique effects of the motivation variables, two behavioral indicators from the Effort Discounting task related to creativity. That is, insensitivity to the level of effort required related to higher lifetime creative accomplishment. Insensitivity to the level of reward that could be obtained correlated with more willingness to persist on the creativity task and was higher in the bipolar group than the control comparison group. In sum, effort-based decision-making was related to bipolar disorder, to lifetime creative accomplishment, and to performance on a difficult creativity task. As such, this work contributes to a growing body of research on the role of motivation in creativity. Limitations are discussed.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Fascination regarding creativity in people with BD dates to Plato and Aristotle (H. S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Akiskal &amp; Akiskal, 2007)</ref>, and large-scale studies support the idea that those with BD as well as their family members show enhanced creativity <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kyaga et al., 2013)</ref>. The link with creativity is intriguing, as it indicates adaptive facets of vulnerability to BD(H. S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Akiskal &amp; Akiskal, 2007)</ref>. Given the pernicious stigma associated with the condition, and the serious consequences of stigma and discrimination for self-esteem, treatment access and engagement, and quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hawke et al., 2013)</ref>, better understanding of creativity in BD is an important public health goal.</p><p>To date, though, relatively little is understood about the mechanisms to explain this link.</p><p>That is, most of the extant literature considers creative occupations, creative accomplishments, or creative hobbies-and not the processes that guide such outcomes. The goal of this study is to consider whether two facets of motivation--ambition and willingness to work hard for reward -contribute to heightened creativity. A small number of studies indicate that BD is related to both motivational indices-willingness to exert effort in pursuit of reward, and self-ratings of high life ambition. Moreover, self-rated ambition has been shown to be tied to some of the facets of creativity observed within BD. The goal of this study is to conduct a multi-modal test of these two approaches to motivation in people with BD, using several indices of creativity.</p><p>To consider the empirical evidence linking BD and creativity, it is important to begin by defining creativity. At a broad level, creativity has been defined by novelty and functionality. But under this broad umbrella, many different types of creative outcomes have been studied, and these are only modestly correlated. Commonly studied facets of creativity include eminence, employment in a creative occupation, lifetime accomplishments such as publishing a book or holding an art exhibition, and creative problem-solving in laboratory tasks.</p><p>Researchers have shown correlations of BD with each of these forms of creativity. For example, as first documented by Kay Redfield Jamison <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jamison, 1993)</ref>, across multiple analyses of biographies, BD appears to be over-represented among those who have achieved fame for their creativity (see <ref type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2012 for review)</ref>.</p><p>Some have criticized eminence, though, as social and personal characteristics may contribute to whether a person becomes famous or is the focus of biographies. As one example, people who seem more interesting may be more likely to be chosen as a focus for biographies.</p><p>Given this, some have considered the ability to establish a creative occupation as a somewhat more direct indicator of creativity. Several researchers have shown elevated rates of BD symptoms within samples of artists, musicians, or authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Johnson, Murray, et al., 2012)</ref>. It also appears that those with BD may be more likely to choose creative careers than are those without the condition, as shown in psychiatric samples (H. S.  and community representative samples. For example, in the Epidemiological Catchment Area study, mean ratings of occupational creativity were significantly higher for those with bipolar I disorder (4.54 on a scale of 0 to 100) as compared to those no diagnosis of BD (3.07) <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Tremblay et al., 2010)</ref>. In a Swedish population cohort study of more than one million people, BD was the only psychiatric illness to be elevated across creative occupations <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kyaga et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Beyond occupational status, researchers have considered the degree of lifetime creative accomplishment, using scales such as the Lifetime Creativity Scale , an interview-based assessment of creative accomplishments such as publishing books or public artistic performances. In one study, 33 people with bipolar spectrum disorders were rated as showing higher lifetime creativity on this scale as compared to persons without a diagnosis of BD. Those diagnosed with bipolar spectrum disorder showed higher creative accomplishment than did those who had experienced full-fledged manic episodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Richards, Kinney, Lunde, et al., 1988</ref>).</p><p>Beyond creative accomplishments, researchers have considered creative thinking. In a highly influential model, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mednick, (1962)</ref> argued that creative thinking stems from the ability to combine conceptually distinct associative elements in a novel manner, so as to capture unique, but functional, solutions to creative problem-solving tasks. The widely used Remote Associates Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mednick &amp; Mednick, 1967)</ref> was designed to assess the ability to generate a broad range of associations. Participants are provided with three words and asked to find a word that is associated with all three (e.g., mower, atomic, foreign as stimuli, power as the answer). In the Unusual Uses Task (UUT; <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Guilford, 1967)</ref>, participants are asked to suggest as many uses for a common object as they can in a set amount of time. These tests of creative thinking processes are of particular import, as eminence and accomplishment may be shaped so profoundly by opportunity, training, and personality traits.</p><p>In one example of theory regarding creative processes, it has been argued that divergent thinking might advantage creative thinking within people with BD. More specifically, some have proposed that the reduced cognitive inhibition frequently observed among persons with BD and their family members <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bora et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bora &amp; Pantelis, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Carson et al., 2003)</ref> might lead to generating more associations, and specifically more unique associations <ref type="bibr">(Carson et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Lloyd-Evans et al., 2006)</ref>. Mild lifetime experiences of hypomanic symptoms, as measured with the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS; <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Kwapil et al., 2000)</ref>, were related to higher fluency scores on the UUT in two studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Furnham et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ruiter &amp; Johnson, 2015)</ref>. Despite the import of theory and this early data, there are some problems with this model. First, divergent thinking is observed in many psychopathologies that are unrelated to creativity <ref type="bibr">(Ma, 2009)</ref>. Second, in the two studies of persons with clinically diagnoses of bipolar disorder, neither bipolar spectrum disorder nor bipolar I disorder related to elevated divergent thinking on measures such as the UUT, as compared to comparison groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Johnson, Tharp, et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Santosa et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>In sum, evidence suggests that BD is related to creative eminence, and engagement in creative occupations. There is little evidence, though, that BD advantages creative thinking. This leads to questions about the types of mechanisms that could be involved in promoting the creative advantage seen in bipolar disorder.</p><p>Here, we focus on a psychological variable proposed to explain the creativity in BD: motivation. One theory suggests that BD is related to heightened motivation, which might in turn contribute to success in difficult endeavors <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Johnson, 2005)</ref>. Given the effort required to attain creative accomplishments such as establishing a professional career in music or publishing poetry, heightened motivation might be an important driver of creativity. Indeed, prominent models of creativity in the general population describe the import of effort, often echoing Thomas Edison's quote that "Genius is 2 percent inspiration and 98 percent perspiration" <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Jones, 2018)</ref>. For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Amabile's (1983)</ref> highly influential model describes creative outcomes as the result of domain-relevant skills, creative thinking, and motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Amabile, 1983)</ref>. Considerable research highlights the import of motivation in creativity, across laboratory and lifetime creativity measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hennessey, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Motivational studies of bipolar disorder draw from the large body of work indicating that persons with bipolar disorder report greater psychological reactivity to rewards <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Johnson, Edge, et al., 2012)</ref>, and differential neural activation patterns to reward-related stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chase et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Nusslock, Almeida, et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Nusslock, Harmon-Jones, et al., 2012)</ref>. Neural reactivity to rewards has been tied to key clinical features of the disorder, including impulsivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Johnson et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Mason et al., 2014)</ref>. Beyond the cross-sectional work, self-rated and physiological sensitivity to rewards has been shown to predict the onset of bipolar spectrum disorder, and the conversion from bipolar spectrum disorder to bipolar I disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grant et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Nusslock, Harmon-Jones, et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Stange et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>One dimension of the reward sensitivity observed in bipolar disorder is a tendency toward heightened motivation to pursue difficult goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Johnson, Edge, et al., 2012)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Johnson &amp; Carver (2006a)</ref> developed a self-report measure termed the WASSUP (Willingly Approached Set of Statistically Unlikely Pursuits) to capture ambitions to pursue highly difficult-to-attain life goals.</p><p>Across studies, people diagnosed with BD endorse highly ambitious life goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grant et al., 2011;</ref>. High goal setting is also observed among undiagnosed persons at high risk for mania, as measured with the Hypomanic Personality Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fulford et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gruber &amp; Johnson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Johnson, Murray, et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson &amp; Carver, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Johnson &amp; Jones, 2009)</ref>. It is a natural question to what extent heightened motivation is a trait-like feature of bipolar disorder vs a state-dependent feature of hypomanic or manic episodes.</p><p>Several studies indicate that these ambitions also do not appear to be an artifact of manic symptoms in that this profile is observed even after adjusting for current mood symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Fulford et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gruber &amp; Johnson, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Johnson, Murray, et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Johnson &amp; Carver, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Johnson &amp; Jones, 2009)</ref>, and predicts the onset of BD <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Grant et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to endorsing highly ambitious life goals, persons with BD also appear to work harder to earn rewards on behavioral tasks. For example, when given an opportunity to earn a reward, people with BD I completed a card sorting task faster than did a non-BD comparison group. These group differences did not emerge in the non-reward condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hayden et al., 2008)</ref>.</p><p>Those with BD and those at risk for the condition have also been shown to demonstrate more sustained engagement (as indexed by behavioral persistence as well as increased left frontal cortical activity) in the pursuit of reward as tasks become difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Harmon-Jones et al., 2002</ref>).</p><p>Several studies have examined how ambitious goal setting is related to creative accomplishment among those with BD. Among highly creative persons diagnosed with BD, ambitious goal setting (as measured with the WASSUP) was elevated compared to normative samples and was associated with increased creative achievements <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Johnson, Murray, et al., 2015)</ref>. Ambitious goal setting (WASSUP) also shows correlations with some forms of creativity.</p><p>Several studies suggest that WASSUP scores are related to measures of creativity that appear elevated in BD--willingness to persist on difficult creative tasks and to lifetime creative accomplishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Johnson, Murray et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ruiter &amp; Johnson, 2015)</ref>. More specifically, in two studies of undergraduates, WASSUP scores statistically mediated the correlation of hypomanic risk scores (HPS) with higher lifetime creative accomplishments, with better performance on a laboratory measure of willingness to persist on difficult a creative problem-solving task <ref type="bibr">(Ruiter &amp; Johnson, 2015)</ref> and with higher self-ratings of creative proclivities <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Johnson, Murray, et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>WASSUP scores are statistically distinct from creative thought indices, such as the UUT, among persons with BD I-of interest as indices such as the UUT are also not generally elevated among those with BD disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Johnson, Tharp, et al., 2015)</ref>. These results suggest that motivation could contribute to the creative accomplishments among those with BD, consistent with the broader literature on the import of motivation for creativity in the general population (Hennessy, 2019).</p><p>To date, though, studies of the links between motivation and creativity in BD have relied on self-ratings of ambition. There is some base for thinking these findings would extend to a behavioral measure of willingness to exert effort for reward. Beyond the work noted above indicating that those with bipolar disorder tend to show greater willingness to exert effort for reward, previous work has shown that among persons with bipolar disorder, one subscale of the WASSUP (Financial Success) related to more willingness to choose difficult tasks on an effort discounting task, even when the level of reward was not higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Johnson et al., 2017)</ref>. Drawing on this literature, we hypothesized that creativity would be correlated with greater willingness to choose a difficult task as compared to an easier task on the effort discounting task, in which participants are asked to choose between earning more money by squeezing a handgrip effortfully vs accepting a smaller amount of money for no effort <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hartmann et al., 2013)</ref>. Our goal was to extend previous work by directly examining how this behavioral measure of motivation would relate to creativity.</p><p>In sum, we examine whether individual differences in self-rated and behavioral indices of motivation could help explain individual differences in creativity. Given that motivation has been found relate to creativity in the general population and in bipolar disorder, we expected to see effects across those with and without BD. As a secondary goal, we consider whether mean levels of motivation are elevated in a sample of persons with BD as compared to a non-BD comparison sample. In considering our hypotheses, we attend to a broad range of potential confounds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses</head><p>Drawing on previous literature, we expected that self-rated and behavioral motivational measures (the WASSUP and performance on a task designed to measure effort-based decision-making) would relate to lifetime creative accomplishments and to performance on a creative task that required persistence. As a control comparison, we included the UUT. We did not expect that motivation would be tied to creative thought as measured on the UUT, as effort and persistence would be less central to performance on this measure. We examine these effects within the full sample, as we had no a priori reason to think that motivation would be irrelevant for those without BD. As a secondary hypothesis, we examined whether those with BD would show higher motivation than the control comparison group, as measured by self-rated ambition and by behavioral choices on an effort discounting task.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, we recruited people with and without BD. Because previous findings consistently indicate that creativity is more elevated in less severe as compared to more severe forms of disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Johnson et al., 2016;</ref>, we recruited those with bipolar I, bipolar II, or cyclothymic disorder. As our goal was to understand processes that might contribute to creativity, we designed our recruitment strategies to over-sample highly creative individuals (we would note that this recruitment strategy interferes with comparing whether diagnostic groups differed on creativity).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Method</head><p>Data for this study was collected at two sites. All procedures for this study were approved by university Institutional Review Boards at both universities before data collection commenced. All participants completed written informed consent procedures. Data was de-identified before transfer across sites, and all data was collected and stored on secure sites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Participants and Procedure</head><p>Participants were recruited in metropolitan areas in Northern California, USA (Site 1) and British Columbia, Canada (Site 2). Inclusion criteria included adults aged 18-65 with primary bipolar I, bipolar II disorder, or cyclothymic disorder, and in the comparison group, those with no current or history of bipolar or psychotic disorder, as assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5). Participants were recruited through outpatient mental health services and support groups, the Collaborative Research Team to study psychosocial issues in BD (CREST.BD) network and wider community, and through online advertisements and flyers to the creative community, including art schools and performing art centers and theatres. We placed online advertisements to the general public and to recruit creative individuals, we displayed advertisements to specific user groups that routinely interact with visual and performing arts accounts on social media platforms. Participants from previous studies were also offered the option to participate. To avoid potential confounds in cognitive ability and focus, we excluded participants with a history of brain injury or neurological illness; substance use disorder or alcohol use disorder within the past year; ECT within the past year; use of typical antipsychotic medications in past 8 weeks; medical conditions or medications that could interfere with accurate diagnosis; impaired mental status, disability, medical illness that would interfere with task completion or diagnosis. To allow for a consideration of the role of depressive symptoms, which are frequently present among those with BD, we did not exclude participants from the comparison group who endorsed depressive symptoms.</p><p>We purposefully recruited more participants for the BD group than the comparison group to allow for analyses of individual differences within that group. We gathered data from 49 individuals who met diagnostic criteria for BD (19 from Site 1 and 30 from Site 2), and 39 in the non-BD group (29 from Site 1 and 10 from Site 2) who did not meet criteria for BD. Two of the non-BD group from site 1 were excluded due to poor task performance. Within the BD group, 35 met criteria for bipolar I disorder, 13 for bipolar II disorder, and 1 for cyclothymia. In terms of illness course and medication use, 28 of the BD group reported a history of psychotic symptoms, and 23 reported taking antipsychotic medications currently; 35 of the 49 were currently taking psychotropic medications. Of the comparison group, 24 met diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder during their lifetime, perhaps related to some of our advertisements mentioning our interest in mood. <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref> shows sample characteristics by diagnostic group for categorical variables. <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> shows sample characteristics by diagnostic group for continuous variables (transformed variables shown).</p><p>Participants completed phone screening for inclusion/exclusion criteria, and then an inperson session of other measures. Participants were compensated an hourly rate standard to their area and could earn up to additional remuneration for task performance. <ref type="bibr">DSM-5 (SCID-5;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(First, 2015)</ref> is a widely used semi-structured interview to assess psychopathology.

The Structured Clinical Interview for</head><p>Interviewers were trained to administer the SCID-5 by the principal investigators, attained interrater reliability with sample tapes, and then practiced administering interview modules with experienced interviewers. Throughout the study, diagnostic interviewers took part in reliability meetings to protect against rater drift. Difficult diagnostic decisions were reviewed by consensus.</p><p>Effort Discounting Task <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hartmann et al., 2015)</ref>. We used a modification of an effort discounting task developed and validated by Hartmann et al., 2015. The task was programmed in Python, with keyboard control, and a Biopac hand dynamometer TSD121c device with a DA100C transducer synchronized with the task delivery computer through the parallel port using a MP160WSW data acquisition module.</p><p>Within this task, participants are asked to make choices to expend physical effort, as assessed using a hand grip device, to earn reward on a series of trials. Degree of effort and magnitude of reward were varied, to provide an index of the extent to which a person is willing to exert higher effort to earn rewards, and to assess their sensitivity to effort required and to the magnitude of reward.</p><p>Before the task began, hand grip strength was calibrated. That is, participants were asked to squeeze the hand grip as hard as they could for two seconds (with visual display on the screen of the force level). They were then told they could earn $1 if they could sustain a harder squeeze in the next round. In each of 128 trials, participants could choose a chance to earn $1 by doing nothing, or to earn more money by squeezing the hand grip device at a level calibrated to their maximum ability for 2 seconds. Trials varied in the magnitude of reward for the hard task ($1.50, $1, $2, $2.5, or $5), and by effort (20, 30, 40, 60, or 80% of maximum grip strength) required to earn that payment. Trial outcomes were not certain (as with real life) and were randomly set to be rewarded or not. One correction was made during the study, in that we intended to select 50% of trials to be rewarded but realized that the initial program was selecting 56% of trials for reward.</p><p>Hence 62% of participants received rewards on 56% of trials, and 38% on 50% of trials evaluated below). At the end of the session, participants were paid based on their winnings on 20 randomly selected trials ($~35 on average).</p><p>To provide indices for analyses, we calculated regression estimates within each person.</p><p>Our primary indices were regression parameters to index the effect of effort required and the effect of reward magnitude. To consider the potentially confounding effects of exhaustion, we calculated a regression parameter within each person to capture the effect of trial number. The accuracy of these individual estimates for each person varied, as reflected in varied standard errors. Standard errors were high when persons showed little variability in their choices: 10 individuals chose the hard choice on every trial and another 3 chose the hard choice on almost all trials, which provided no opportunity to decipher their sensitivity to reward vs. effort. We removed estimates where the standard error for a given estimate was &gt; 1000 from analyses. This left 41 participants in the BD group and 32 in the comparison group for these analyses. As part of a larger study, 20 participants completed the effort discounting task while fMRI scanning was completed. Effects of this context variation were considered in analyses below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Willingly Approached Set of Statistically Unlikely Pursuits-Popular Fame, Financial</head><p>Success and Creativity Subscales (WASSUP; <ref type="bibr">Johnson &amp; Carver, 2006)</ref>. The WASSUP subscales were designed to assess extremely high life ambitions. Participants indicate how likely they are to set specific highly ambitious life goals (e.g., "you will have 20 million dollars or more"). We used two subscales that have been particularly validated as relevant to BD: the 5-item Popular Fame and 3-item Financial Success scales, supplemented with the 5-item Creative ambitions for its relevance to this study. Internal consistency was modest, as is often observed with very brief scales, alpha for Creativity = .61, for Financial Success = .69, and for Popular Fame = .88. Rather than rely on subscales with low reliability, we used one WASSUP total score, alpha = .83.

The CRAT is a modification of the original Remote Associates Test, in which there is only one correct solution per trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Mednick &amp; Mednick, 1967)</ref>. In each trial, participants are presented with three words (e.g., age, mile, and sand), and then asked to identify one word that would form a compound with all three words (e.g., stone). The trials were rated for difficulty based on the amount of time required to find a solution. After a practice block, the task included 7 blocks of 10 words each i ; each block is progressively more difficult. 1 After each block, participants can choose to continue or not, such that success reflects willingness to persevere on a difficult task.</p><p>We scored the number of correct trials, which has been shown to correlate with risk for mania <ref type="bibr">(Ruiter &amp; Johnson, 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Unusual Uses Task (UUT)</head><p>The UUT <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Guilford, 1967)</ref> is a widely used measure of divergent thinking. In the current study, participants were given three prompts (screwdriver, toothpicks, and sheet of paper), which appeared in random order. For each prompt, they were asked to name as many different uses as they could think of within a 2-min period. Participants were asked to say any use that came to mind, no matter how strange it might seem. The example stimulus was a brick, and example uses were doorstop, paperweight, and weapon. Responses were audio-recorded to prevent results from being influenced by writing speed, and then were transcribed for coding.</p><p>The key index of creative thought on the UUT is originality-or the novelty of the uses proposed. The task also can be scored for fluency, defined by the number of valid non-redundant uses proposed, of interest given that manic states can involve increased verbal production.</p><p>Three raters who were unaware of diagnostic status coded responses based on a detailed scoring manual, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. As recommended <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Silvia et al., 2008)</ref>, we used a rating system to exclude responses that were judged to be errors (e.g., "use as a bed" for toothpicks) or too vague ("build something") to be coded reliably before scoring other UUT indices. These judgements were reviewed by two senior team members. Bipolar and comparison groups did not differ in the rates of errors, Mn BD = 5.65 (SD = 4.091) Mn comparison = 5.81 (SD = 6.337), t (83) = -.137, p = .892, Hedge's g =.03. We identified responses that were synonyms (e.g., "to write on" and "to write an essay" for paper), so as to apply coding to the number of distinct uses provided. Hence, fluency scores reflect the number of distinct responses that were clear and valid. To code uniqueness, responses were assigned points based on the number of study participants who had provided that use, such that participants received a 0 for each use provided by more than 5 people, a 1 if 5 people had provided the use, a 2 if 4 people had provided the use, a 3 if 3 people had provided the use, a 4 if 2 people had provided the use, and a 5 if they were the only person to provide the use. Uniqueness scores were summed across a participant's valid and clear responses. Not surprisingly, then, fluency and uniqueness scores were highly correlated, r(89) = .801, p &lt; .001. We focus on uniqueness, which is the key index of creative thinking.</p><p>Creative occupational status. We coded current and previous positions for creativity, including musicians, authors or writers, Ph.D. level engagement in scientific research at universities, and other creative occupations, consistent with previous work on creativity in BD <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kyaga et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Kyaga et al., , 2013</ref>. Due to experimental error, details about occupational creativity were not gathered for 3 people who were employed. Given the limited employment history of some participants, we could only consider creative occupation status for 84 individuals Accordingly, we were not powered to consider this variable in analyses given the lower n and the categorical nature of the variable. Of the 84 participants with occupational information available, 21 (25%) had been employed in a creative occupation, including 2 musicians, 4 writers, 2 in scientific creative positions, and 15 in other creative occupations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Analysis Plan</head><p>Analyses were conducted via SPSS Version 27 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp) with two-tailed tests, alpha = .05. Before conducting hypotheses, univariate distributions were examined. We provide bivariate correlations of key variables as background for our multivariate models. Then, we conducted a series of analyses to identify potential confounds by testing the following. First, we consider relationships of site (using t-tests) and demographic variables (gender, age, executive control <ref type="bibr">[RDS]</ref>, or SES [MacArthur ladder] using bivariate correlations) with creativity and motivational variables. Second, we tested diagnostic group differences in demographic or clinical variables (using t-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables), or in exhaustion on the effort discounting task (as indexed by the effects of trial number on choice behavior) using a t-test. Third, we used repeated measures ANOVA to consider whether choices on the effort discounting task varied for version (50 vs. 56%), context (fMRI vs. behavioral), gender, or by age and mania severity (YMRS). The repeated measures ANOVA also provided information on whether individuals showed the expected sensitivity to the reward and effort levels in their decision-making on this task. Finally, given the clinical import of better understanding of whether mood state and medications influence creativity in bipolar disorder, we also tested whether mood and medication levels were related to laboratory-based measures of creativity within bipolar disorder.</p><p>To test the motivational model of creativity, we constructed three parallel regression models to assess whether our multi-modal measures of motivation (the WASSUP and 2 indices from the effort discounting task) related to the dependent variables of lifetime creative accomplishment (the CAQ), to creative problem-solving on a task that required persistence (the CRAT), and to our control comparison measure of creative thinking (UUT). Potential confounds identified in the above analyses were controlled as needed. As we expected motivation to be related to creativity transdiagnostically, we included all participants within these analyses. As exploratory information, we tested the interaction of diagnostic group with each motivational index.</p><p>To examine the hypothesis that the BD group would show higher motivation than the comparison group would, we conducted three t-tests to compare diagnostic groups on ambition (WASSUP) scores, and on the effort discounting task regression parameters reflecting sensitivity to reward magnitude and effort required.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>No participants failed the attention checks. Key variables were approximately normally distributed, with the exceptions of CAQ scores and sensitivity to reward magnitude scores (effort discounting task). To address extremely high skew (4.752) and kurtosis (29.09) in CAQ scores, two extremely high scores were winsorized (set to the next highest score, which was 55, the 98 th percentile). To address the extremely high skew (4.989) and kurtosis (27.686) for the magnitude of reward, two extreme scores were set to the 97 th percentile score (a raw score of 19.5).</p><p>Bivariate correlations. As background for tests of hypotheses, we provide bivariate correlations in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. As has been shown repeatedly, different facets of creativity were relatively independent from each other. As shown, those in creative occupations obtained higher lifetime creative accomplishment scores (CAQ) and modestly higher UUT scores. Other creativity indices were not significantly intercorrelated.</p><p>Within the motivation domain, WASSUP scores showed expected correlations to lower sensitivity to effort required and were not related significantly to sensitivity to reward magnitude.</p><p>Stated differently, higher self-rated ambition (WASSUP scores) related to significantly more willingness to choose the more difficult task, without regard to the level of reward.</p><p>Creativity scores showed several significant bivariate correlations with motivational variables.

There were no significant differences by site in the creativity (CRAT, CAQ, UUT) or motivation variables (WASSUP, Sensitivity to reward magnitude, Sensitivity to effort required on the effort discounting task. Most of the demographic variables were not significantly correlated with creativity or motivation variables, but older participants attained higher CRAT scores, r (83) = .268, p = .014, and were less sensitive to reward magnitude, r (71) = -.286, p = .015. Below, we consider whether age differences could contribute to observed effects.</p><p>Groups (BD versus comparison) were well-matched. We were able to recruit diagnostic groups that were relatively well-matched on creativity, in that groups did not differ significantly in CAQ, CRAT, UUT Uniqueness or fluency scores (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>), nor in the percentage of individuals employed in creative occupations (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Table 1</ref>). As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">Tables 1 and 2, the BD   and comparison groups did not differ significantly on employment status, MacArthur SES ratings,</ref> gender, ethnicity, education, executive function (RDS), mood scores at the time of the session (AVI), depression symptom severity (QIDS), or history of substance use or alcohol use disorder (SCID) (using chi-square tests to test categorical variables and t-tests to test continuous variables). Participants in the BD group were more likely to be white, but race was not significantly to any of the creativity or motivation variables, all F's &lt; .88, all p's &gt; .46. The BD group was older than the comparison group. As one would expect, participants in the BD group were also more likely to report a history of psychosis (SCID) and obtained higher scores on the mania severity interview (YMRS) than the comparison group. The BD group, though, did not endorse higher levels of self-rated manic symptoms (ASRM) than the comparison group did, consistent with the idea of greater sensitivity of interviewer-based measures, and the greater range of symptoms covered in the interview measure. Below, we consider the potential effects of age and current mania severity on creativity and motivation indices.</p><p>We also examined potential confounds in the effort discounting task. We began by considering the potential confound of exhaustion (as indexed by the regression parameter for the effect of trial number) by diagnostic group. The diagnostic groups showed no significant difference in exhaustion (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>). Then, we assessed whether issues of version (50% vs. 56% reward rate), setting (behavioral vs. fMRI), or gender influenced choices. To do so, we conducted a repeated measures ANOVA on probability of choosing the hard task based. Effort required for the hard task (20, 30, 40, 60, or 80% of maximum grip strength) and reward magnitude level ($1.50, $1, $2, $2.5, or $5) were within-subject factors, with version, and setting (behavioral vs. fMRI), and gender as factors, and the potential confounds of age and mania severity (YMRS) as covariates.</p><p>Version, setting and gender did not influence scores directly or interaction with any other variable (effort required, reward magnitude). Age and mania ratings also did not relate to the probability of choosing the hard task. Accordingly, version, setting, gender, age and mania severity were not controlled in tests of hypotheses. Because Mauchly's tests of sphericity were significant, Greenhouse-Geisser corrections were applied to the within-subject degrees of freedom. These basic analyses confirmed the significance of expected effects for effort required <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">, F(1.81, 74)</ref>, 12.227, p &lt; .001, reward magnitude, F(2.07, 74) = 15.233, p &lt; .0005, and their interaction , F(9.691, 74)=3.488, p &lt; .0005. As expected, people were more likely to choose the hard task if the trial was worth more money, and if it required less effort, but the effect of effort required was less powerful when the trial was worth more money (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>).</p><p>To examine whether laboratory indices of creativity levels within the bipolar group were influenced by clinical severity or treatment, we conducted bivariate correlations. More specifically, we examined self-rated depression, interview-rated mania, self-rated mania, medication status (presence/absence of lithium, antipsychotic, antiseizure, antidepressant or benzodiazepine/other sedative hypnotic medications). We also examined bipolar diagnostic status (dichotomized as bipolar I vs. bipolar spectrum disorders). As shown in <ref type="table">Table 4</ref>, of the 18 correlations examined, only 1 was significant at the alpha = .05 level. That is, performance on the CRAT was lower among those who endorsed higher depression (QIDS), but this effect did not surpass Bonferroni correction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Tests of the Core Hypothesis: Do the Motivation Variables relate to Creativity?</head><p>To assess the unique and conjoint effects of the self-rated and behavioral motivation indices on creativity, we constructed regression models to conjointly consider the self-rated and behavioral indices of motivation. Parallel, separate models were constructed to examine lifetime creative accomplishment (CAQ), persistence on an increasingly difficult creativity task (CRAT), and creative thinking (UUT). We controlled for age in block 1 for the models of CAQ and CRAT.</p><p>Although we expected motivation to advantage creativity across the full (BD and comparison) sample, we first examined interaction terms of diagnostic group x each motivation variable. None were significant, and all effect sizes were small, partial r's &lt; .20, accounting for less than 4% of the variance. Accordingly, we present the simple main effects of the motivation variables on creativity across both groups. Collinearity indices were adequate for each model (VIF &lt; 1.37).</p><p>As shown in <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 5</ref>, in these multivariate models, as with the bivariate correlations, CRAT scores were related to less sensitivity to reward magnitude, and CAQ scores were related to less sensitivity to effort required. As expected, the effects of motivational variables on the UUT were not significant. WASSUP scores did not contribute variance above and beyond sensitivity to effort or reward.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Do the bipolar and comparison group differ on motivation measures?</head><p>T-tests to compare the diagnostic groups on the motivational measures are shown in <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>.</p><p>Contrary to expectation, diagnostic groups did not differ on ambition (WASSUP) levels. Controlling for age and mania severity (YMRS) did not substantively change this finding.</p><p>To examine diagnostic group differences on the effort discounting task, we used the regression estimates calculated for each participant. The BD and comparison groups did not differ significantly in sensitivity to the degree of effort required (see <ref type="table">Table 2</ref> for results of the t-test).</p><p>Rather, the comparison group showed significantly more variability in their sensitivity to reward magnitude than did the BD group on the Levene's test, and the effect of reward magnitude was significantly higher for those in the comparison group. Taken together, these results indicate the BD group was as willing to choose the hard task when high effort was required as the comparison group was, but they were significantly less influenced by the amount of money that could be earned for a given trial in making their decisions about effort.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>The current study provides a test of the role of motivation in relation to creativity. We extended previous work to consider how specific dimensions of motivation relate to both tasks and real-world expressions of creativity across those with and without diagnoses of BD. The strengths of the study included the use of structured interviews to ascertain diagnostic status, and the inclusion of 25% of participants in both groups who were engaged in creative occupations. Our groups were well-matched on gender, employment, education, SES, executive control, and alcohol or substance use diagnoses, and we also tested carefully for age, symptoms, and medication as potential confounds of findings. We used a multi-modal approach to assessing creativity and motivation using self-report and laboratory measures of both. Our approach of measuring multiple facets of creativity is of import given that previous work and current findings highlight the quite modest correlations among different forms of creativity.</p><p>The current study provided the opportunity to examine how two different approaches to measuring motivation were related. That is, we examined how a self-rated measure of ambition that has been well-validated in BD (the WASSUP) related to laboratory measures of motivation. In one study in a BD sample, WASSUP scores were related to effort discounting on the EffRT task <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Johnson et al., 2017)</ref>. The current work extends this by disentangling sensitivity to effort vs. sensitivity to reward as separable parameters and by considering effects beyond bipolar disorder.</p><p>Across diagnostic groups, ambition scores (WASSUP) were correlated with less sensitivity to effort required. These findings make intuitive sense given that highly ambitious goals are generally more difficult to achieve. Those who are less focused on the difficulty of tasks may be more willing to set these high goals for their life. Bivariate analyses also extend previous findings linking WASSUP scores to lifetime creative accomplishment <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Johnson, Murray et al., 2015)</ref> by demonstrating this effect across diagnostic groups. In multivariate models, WASSUP scores did not predict additional variance above and beyond the effort discounting scores, which is perhaps not surprising given correlations among these measures of motivation.</p><p>Turning to the major goal of our paper, we expected that motivation would be more relevant for our two creativity outcomes that require more persistence: the CRAT that was designed to require perseverance in the face of increasingly difficult problems, and the CAQ that indexes major creative accomplishments that typically take sustained effort to reach. Consistent with our hypotheses, we observed significant effects of motivation variables on both of these creativity indices across bivariate and multivariate models. This extends previous work that had shown links of these two creativity measures with the self-rated WASSUP scale <ref type="bibr">(Ruiter &amp; Johnson, 2015)</ref>. In the present study, lifetime creative accomplishment (CAQ) was related to less sensitivity to the effort required on the effort discounting task. Persistence in a creativity task (CRAT) related to significantly less sensitivity to reward magnitude on the effort discounting task.</p><p>Although we had no a priori reason to predict differential effects of sensitivity to reward vs. sensitivity to effort, the diminished sensitivity to effort fits with the idea that lifetime accomplishments in creativity require extensive effort. Although we did not directly measure intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation, the effects of diminished sensitivity to reward with persistence on the creativity task fits with previous theory and empirical work on the import of intrinsic, as compared to extrinsic, motivation for creativity <ref type="bibr">(Amabile, 1995)</ref>. For example, in research using standardized creativity puzzles, researchers have shown that people who endorse completing tasks for enjoyment or mastery generally attain better performance than those who were asked to focus on extrinsic rewards <ref type="bibr">(Amabile, 1985)</ref>. Scales designed to capture trait-like levels of intrinsic motivation (in general and for creative tasks) are generally stronger correlates of lifetime creativity than are scales designed to assess levels of extrinsic motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Taylor &amp; Kaufman, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hennessey 2019)</ref>.</p><p>We expected less influence of motivational variables on the UUT, a measure of divergent thinking that is not designed to capture perseverance and has not been found to relate to selfrated ambition (WASSUP) or to BD <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Johnson, Tharp, et al., 2015)</ref>. Unexpectedly, divergent thinking scores (UUT) were related to less sensitivity to the effort required on the effort discounting task, but the effect was no longer significant within the multivariate models. Taken together, our behavioral measures of reward appear particularly relevant to perseverance on a creativity task and to lifetime creative accomplishment. Our findings extend previous research that two facets of creativity which require substantial effort, one laboratory and one life course measure, are tied to effort-based decision-making.</p><p>Our findings are also relevant to understanding the nature of motivation within BD.</p><p>Contrary to our expectations, the BD and comparison groups did not differ in their self-rated ambitions (WASSUP). Rather the BD group showed significantly less sensitivity to reward magnitude than the comparison group did. Stated differently, those with BD were generally as willing to choose to exert high effort for reward but were more indifferent to the amount of money that could be earned for a given trial in making those decisions about effort than were those without BD. Using different tasks, insensitivity to the magnitude of reward has been observed in neuro-imaging research on BD <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Johnson et al., 2019)</ref>. There is also behavioral evidence to support the possibility that participants with BD show less sensitivity to value differences in the context of probabilistic reward tasks when making choices to maximize reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Yechiam et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Roiser et al., 2009)</ref>. One possibility is that those with BD are highly responsive to small levels of reward, without regard to magnitude of reward <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Johnson et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>There are several limitations in the current work that are important to acknowledge. First, the lack of longitudinal data also limits our conclusions about creativity and motivation. Although it is possible that motivational variables foster creative outcomes, it is possible that people with greater life success, by virtue of innate creativity or other qualities, sustain more motivation in the face of less reward. We do not have the ability to verify the direction of effects. Second, we are reliant on previous work describing the bipolar creative advantage, because our over-sampling of those in creative occupations interferes with testing group differences in creativity. Third, our sample size was small, we were particularly underpowered to examine interactions of diagnostic group with motivational variables. Fourth, although findings fit with the idea that those who are less dependent on extrinsic rewards are more likely to persist in a creativity task, the effects of extrinsic rewards on creativity may depend on the framing of the task, the types of extrinsic reward, and may interact with intrinsic motivation levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hennessey, 2019)</ref>. Although our findings are intriguing to contemplate in the context of this broader literature on facets of motivation, the current study was not designed to disentangle these processes. Future research would do well to consider sensitivity to a broader array of extrinsic rewards, with attention to key interactions with intrinsic rewards.</p><p>Notwithstanding the limitations, current findings shed light on the validity of the WASSUP scale, provide novel multimodal evidence regarding the role of motivation and creativity, and extend previous work on insensitivity to the degree of reward in BD. These findings highlight specific motivational processes that may be adaptive in the pursuit of artistic careers and in solving difficult creative puzzles.    </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Probability of choosing the hard task on the Effort Discounting Task by Reward Magnitude and Effort required (Collapsed across diagnostic groups)</figDesc></figure>
