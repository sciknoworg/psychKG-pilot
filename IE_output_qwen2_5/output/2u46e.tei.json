    "topic_or_construct": "Aversive Processing and Inhibitory Responding",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral Inhibition Tasks",
    "justification": "The article mentions serotonin's role in anticipation of threat and inhibition of behavior, linking these functions to aversive processing and inhibitory responding, which are typically measured using behavioral inhibition tasks."

    "topic_or_construct": "Patience and Reward Anticipation",
    "measured_by": "Waiting Tasks",
    "justification": "The text discusses the role of serotonin in patience and active waiting for rewards, which are usually assessed using tasks that require waiting for delayed rewards or rewards under conditions of uncertainty."

    "topic_or_construct": "Resource Cost and Reward Signalling",
    "measured_by": "Effort Exertion and Reward Choice Tasks",
    "justification": "Studies in the paper highlight serotonin's influence on the decision to allocate resources, such as time or physical effort, which is often measured in experimental paradigms designed to assess effort exertion and choice behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "Long-Range Average Value Representation",
    "measured_by": "fMRI and Voltammetry",
    "justification": "The article notes that serotonin's role in tracking average environmental richness and long-term value is evidenced through fMRI studies in humans and voltammetry measurements that correlate DRN serotonin activity with offer value."

    "topic_or_construct": "Meta-Decisions and Cost-Benefit Integration",
    "measured_by": "Decision-Making Tasks",
    "justification": "The proposed integrative theory of serotonin in meta-decision making is supported by studies that manipulate serotonin levels and observe changes in complex decision-making tasks that require evaluating costs and benefits."

    "measured_by": "Learned Helplessness Paradigms",
    "justification": "The role of serotonin in signaling environmental controllability and mediating persistence is partly inferred from paradigms like learned helplessness, which are influenced by chronic SSRI administration."
