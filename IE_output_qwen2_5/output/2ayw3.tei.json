    "measured_by": "Retrospective Candidate Reporting",
    "justification": "The study used a retrospective method to report food choices participants considered, which reflects their cached value. This was supported by participants generating options with high general, context-free values, showing reliance on cached values for candidate generation."

    "measured_by": "Rating Scales for Situation-Specific Values",
    "justification": "Participants rated food options based on how suitable they were in the situational context, such as being appropriate for a friend with food restrictions. The strong influence on the final choice demonstrated context-specific values guiding final decision-making."

    "topic_or_construct": "Historical Choice Frequency",
    "measured_by": "Frequency Rating Scales",
    "justification": "Participants rated how often they ate the foods they considered, providing a measure of historical choice frequency, which was shown to have a smaller effect compared to cached value on candidate generation."

    "measured_by": "Consideration Set Reporting",
    "justification": "Participants reported the list of food options that came to mind before making their final choice. The consideration set's composition showed its reliance on cached values and sometimes included irrelevant high-cached-value options in 'think of worst' conditions, highlighting the process of candidate generation."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Relative Extremity Considerations",
    "measured_by": "Quadratic Regression of Value Ratings",
    "justification": "Using quadratic regression, the study incorporated the influence of relative extremity, where candidates with either high or low value extremes were more likely to be recalled in the consideration set, especially noticeable with very poor Stage I values."
