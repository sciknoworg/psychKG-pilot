    "measured_by": "Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART)",
    "justification": "The BART is a computerized task designed to measure clinically relevant risky behavior, and performance on it has been shown to predict real-world risk-taking behaviors, such as substance use and risky sexual behavior."

    "topic_or_construct": "loss aversion",
    "measured_by": "Exponential-Weight Mean-Variance (EWMV) model",
    "justification": "The EWMV model provided parameters that indexed loss aversion, and in the present study, it captured the vulnerability of BD+ individuals for risk-taking by showing they had lower loss aversion compared to BD- and HC."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "behavioral consistency",
    "measured_by": "Exponential-Weight Mean-Variance (EWMV) model",
    "justification": "The EWMV model yielded parameters reflecting behavioral consistency, which demonstrated that individuals with BD displayed more inconsistent decisions during risk-taking on the BART compared to healthy controls."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "risk preference",
    "measured_by": "Exponential-Weight Mean-Variance (EWMV) model",
    "justification": "The EWMV model includes parameters related to risk preference, though the study did not find credible differences in risk preference estimates across the groups."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "prior beliefs",
    "measured_by": "Exponential-Weight Mean-Variance (EWMV) model",
    "justification": "The EWMV model captured prior beliefs about risk scenarios. BD+ exhibited more pessimistic prior beliefs about the balloon bursting in the BART compared to BD- and HC."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "learning rate",
    "measured_by": "Exponential-Weight Mean-Variance (EWMV) model",
    "justification": "The EWMV model estimated learning rates and found that BD+ had higher learning rates compared to HC, indicating a greater propensity to update their beliefs based on recent experiences during the task."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "sensation seeking",
    "measured_by": "Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS)",
    "justification": "Higher scores on the boredom susceptibility subscale of the SSS were associated with altered risk-related parameters, such as increased pessimism and more erratic decision-making in the BART task."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "motivational processes",
    "measured_by": "Behavioral Inhibition System/Behavioral Activation System (BIS/BAS) Scale",
    "justification": "The BIS/BAS scale was used to measure motivational aspects like aversion to negative events and reward sensitivity, and these scores were related to the risk preference and loss aversion parameters from the EWMV model."
