    "topic_or_construct": "social cognition",
    "measured_by": "Dyadic Interaction Platform (DIP)",
    "justification": "The DIP is designed to study social cognition by allowing two individuals to interact face-to-face while their behaviors, physiological responses, and neural activity are recorded. This setup enables the examination of social information processing in bidirectional, dynamic social interactions (Introduction, Social cognition section)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "dynamic social interactions",
    "measured_by": "transparent economic games",
    "justification": "The article describes transparent economic games implemented on the DIP as a tool to study value-based interactions in competitive and cooperative contexts, allowing participants to observe each other's actions in real-time, which is crucial for studying naturalistic decision-making processes (Transparent economic games section)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "perceptual decision-making in dyadic contexts",
    "measured_by": "Continuous Perceptual Report (CPR) paradigm",
    "justification": "The CPR paradigm is used in combination with the DIP to study how social information affects perceptual decision-making. This approach continuously tracks participants' judgments and associated confidence levels, offering insights into how seeing a partner's performance impacts individual decisions (Perceptual decision-making in dyadic contexts section)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "attention and social learning",
    "measured_by": "eyetrackers and mobile EEG systems",
    "justification": "Eyetrackers and mobile EEG systems integrated into the DIP are used to monitor children's attention allocation between social partners and objects in shared visual environments. This allows researchers to examine how continuous social cues influence children's selective attention and learning processes (Attention and social learning section)."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "continuous strategic interactions",
    "measured_by": "real-time dyadic foraging tasks",
    "justification": "The DIP implements real-time dyadic foraging tasks to investigate strategic interactions within a dynamic and evolving action space, where participants can continuously observe their partner's choices and actions, enabling a nuanced understanding of coordination and decision-making dynamics (Continuous strategic interactions section)."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "facial expressions and vocalizations",
    "measured_by": "cameras and microphones",
    "justification": "The DIP incorporates cameras and microphones to capture and analyze nonverbal social signals, such as facial expressions and vocalizations, during interactions. This data contributes to an understanding of how these cues influence social behavior and interaction outcomes (Data acquisition components section)."
