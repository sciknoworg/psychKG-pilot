    "justification": "The BIS/BAS scale, a questionnaire measuring motivational systems including the behavioral inhibition system, was used to assess BIS scores in the study. Women had significantly higher BIS scores than men."

    "measured_by": "BIS/BAS scale",
    "justification": "The BIS/BAS scale, including its subscale BAS Drive which measures the motivation to pursue desired goals, showed that women had significantly higher BAS Drive scores than men."

    "justification": "Visual analogue scales were used to assess subjective exertion, where women reported more exertion for smaller rewards compared to men."
