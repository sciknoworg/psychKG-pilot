    "measured_by": "Direction Integration Task",
    "justification": "The direction integration task, where dot directions were sampled from a Gaussian distribution with varying standard deviations, was used to assess participants' ability to integrate motion information, revealing enhanced performance in autistic children compared to typically developing children in previous studies."

    "measured_by": "Motion Coherence Task",
    "justification": "The motion coherence task measured participants' ability to identify the overall direction of motion amidst moving dots with varying levels of coherence, and EEG data from this task were analyzed for neural responses related to motion perception."

    "measured_by": "Response-Locked EEG Components through RCA",
    "justification": "The most reliable component from RCA, resembling stimulus-locked centro-parietal positivity, was used to analyze decision-related activity, showing that autistic children had lower amplitudes compared to typically developing children in the direction integration task."
