    "measured_by": "Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS)",
    "justification": "The paper describes using the German version of the IUS (Freeston et al., 1994) to measure IU, which includes 18 statements rated on a Likert scale. This scale has shown excellent internal consistency and is explicitly referenced as the instrument to assess IU in Study 1."

    "topic_or_construct": "Indecisiveness",
    "measured_by": "Indecisiveness Scale (Frost & Shows, 1993)",
    "justification": "The Indecisiveness Scale, consisting of 11 items such as 'I often worry about making the wrong decision,' is used to measure the construct of indecisiveness. Participants rated items on a scale from 1 ('strongly disagree') to 5 ('strongly agree'), with the scale showing good internal consistency as cited in the paper."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Safety Behavior",
    "measured_by": "Custom Safety Behavior Rating Items",
    "justification": "To measure safety behaviors, researchers developed custom items reflecting features of safety behaviors identified in the literature on anxiety disorders. These items were rated by participants on a Likert scale, assessing the extent to which their chosen behavior fulfilled the definition of a safety behavior. This assessment is explicitly described in the methodology sections of Studies 1 through 3."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Importance",
    "measured_by": "Decision Importance Items",
    "justification": "Participants rated five items reflecting decision importance (e.g., 'The decision has important consequences') on a 5-point Likert scale. Internal consistency was reported, indicating that this instrument was constructed specifically for this research to measure the importance of decisions across different experimental conditions."
