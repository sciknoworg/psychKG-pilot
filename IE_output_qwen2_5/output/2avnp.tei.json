    "justification": "The study uses the Intentional Binding (IB) task as an implicit measure to investigate SoA, where variations in time perception related to action effects are recorded to assess participants' sense of agency over self-generated actions. The justification for this measurement is that IB effects indicate the perception of a shorter time interval between voluntary actions and their sensory consequences, reflecting a higher sense of agency."
