    "measured_by": "Flanker Task",
    "justification": "The article discusses cognitive control in the context of the flanker task, where cognitive control fluctuates during tasks and upregulates attention in the presence of competing information. The focus on how the brain mobilizes cognitive control dynamically aligns with the task's requirement to maintain attention on relevant stimuli."

    "topic_or_construct": "Attention Modulation",
    "measured_by": "Shrinking Spotlight Model (SSM)",
    "justification": "The models developed in the paper include mechanisms for attention modulation driven by cognitive control or time. Specifically, attentional spotlight changes are calculated based on cognitive control signals within a trial, implicating SSM as a tool for measuring attention modulation."

    "topic_or_construct": "Evidence Accumulation",
    "measured_by": "Feedforward Inhibition (FFI) Model & Leaky-Competing Accumulator (LCA) Model",
    "justification": "The paper compares different mechanisms of evidence accumulation, such as the FFI and LCA models. These models represent differing hypotheses about how the brain processes and accumulates evidence for decision-making, indicating their role in measuring how evidence is computed for cognitive tasks."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Decision Dynamics",
    "measured_by": "Electroencephalography (EEG) Data",
    "justification": "In Experiment 3, EEG data was collected to determine how model-generated attention modulation signals, such as those from LCA control models, correlate with within-trial neural signals. This showcases EEG as a method for measuring the neural underpinnings of decision processes."
