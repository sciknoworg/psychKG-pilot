    "justification": "The study developed a 30-item instrument specifically to assess a base discounting level and the five intertemporal choice anomalies. The justification is provided in the text: 'All data were collected independent of any other study or source, with a 30-item instrument developed specifically for assessing a base discounting level and then the five anomalies.'"

    "topic_or_construct": "absolute magnitude",
    "measured_by": "30-item instrument",
    "justification": "Absolute magnitude was one of the anomalies assessed through the 30-item instrument developed for the study. It measures an increased preference for delayed gains as values increase substantially. The paper references: 'Absolute magnitude: Increased preference for delayed gains when values become substantially larger, even when relative differences are constant.'"

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "gain-loss asymmetry",
    "measured_by": "30-item instrument",
    "justification": "Gain-loss asymmetry, another anomaly, was assessed using the same 30-item instrument. It measures the differing preference levels for gains versus losses over time. The instrument covered this scenario as part of broader intertemporal choice anomalies described in the text."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "delay-speedup asymmetry",
    "measured_by": "30-item instrument",
    "justification": "The 30-item instrument was used to assess delay-speedup asymmetry, which examines preferences when delays are framed differently. The text indicates this anomaly was included in the broader study, validated by the same method."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "present bias",
    "measured_by": "30-item instrument",
    "justification": "Present bias was also one of the anomalies evaluated using the 30-item instrument. It specifically assesses how discounting rates change based on the timing of the start of an interval. The comprehensive method described derives these insights."
  },
  {
    "topic_or_construct": "subadditivity",
    "measured_by": "30-item instrument",
    "justification": "Subadditivity was the fifth anomaly assessed with the 30-item instrument. This effect allows assessment of discounting over different time intervals and was validated as part of the broader study\u2019s methods."
