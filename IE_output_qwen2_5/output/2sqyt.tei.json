    "measured_by": "Relative presentation duration",
    "justification": "The study manipulated the relative presentation duration of items to measure attention's influence, with longer durations reflecting more attention. This is supported by the text stating: 'Specifically, we controlled the order and duration that each item was displayed on the screen' and 'participants were more likely to choose items that were presented longer.'"

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Value Confidence",
    "measured_by": "Confidence ratings",
    "justification": "Participants provided confidence ratings for their value assessments of items. The text supports this by saying, 'Participants rated their confidence in the value ratings on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very) by pressing the corresponding number key on a keyboard.' This was used as a measure of value confidence in Study 2."

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Choice Probability",
    "measured_by": "Choice behavior in experiments",
    "justification": "The probability of choosing an item was measured directly through participants' choice behavior in the experiments. The text states: 'We analyzed the probability of choosing the first item using generalized mixed effects models with a binomial link function.'"

  {
    "topic_or_construct": "Overall Value",
    "measured_by": "Average value ratings",
    "justification": "The overall value of the options was measured by averaging the value ratings of the participants. This is supported by: 'the overall value of the options is based on participants' prior single item ratings that serve as estimates of the true values of the options.'"

    "topic_or_construct": "Prior Expectations",
    "measured_by": "Gaussian distribution fit to actual empirical distribution of values",
    "justification": "The prior expectations about the distribution of values were captured by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the empirical distribution of the participants' value ratings. As stated: 'we assume that the prior takes the form of a Gaussian distribution fit to the actual empirical distribution of values.'"
