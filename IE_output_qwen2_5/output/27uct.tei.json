    "justification": "The TLCG was utilized to investigate the effects of incidental emotions, specifically anger, gratitude, and happiness, on dishonest decision-making behavior (lying) for monetary reward.

    "justification": "The study correlated the rate of egoistic lies with personality traits using the MPS to measure Machiavellianism (amorality and distrust for others) and the BIDR-SV to measure social desirability components like impression management. These instruments revealed that higher rates of egoistic lying were associated with higher amorality and lower impression management scores."
