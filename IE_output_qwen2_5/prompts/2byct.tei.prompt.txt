Introduction
Globally 65-72% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are driven by household consumption with food, shelter, and mobility making the largest contributions 
(1,
2)
. For this reason, demand-side mitigation targeting individual behavior change is increasingly seen as an essential course of action 
(3)

(9)
. In North America, the average annual carbon emissions are 
13.4
 tCO 2e per capita 
(7)
 and both U.S. and Canadian governments have called for a 50% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030. Some of the most impactful actions include minimizing air travel, living car-free, driving electric or high-efficiency vehicles, shifting to renewable energy, and eating vegetarian/vegan diets, each of which is estimated at reducing personal emissions by at least 500kg of CO 2e per year

.
Despite the urgency to mitigate climate change 
(12)
, most people lack the knowledge of GHG emissions associated with daily behaviors and have difficulties in determining which behavior changes are effective at reducing emissions 
(13,
14)
. For example, people underestimate the impact of air travel, meat consumption, and high-energy appliances, while overestimating the impact of littering, recycling, and switching to canvas shopping bags 
(15)

(17)
(18)
(19)
(20)
, possibly because of disproportionate education and government communication on these actions and conflation of pro-environmental and pro-climate behaviors 
(20)
. Consumers are relatively unaware of what changes will reduce food emissions, with buying local and organic often incorrectly suggested as more impactful than reducing animal-product consumption 
(21,
22)
. Despite these knowledge gaps, perceived effectiveness of mitigation measures for mitigating climate change is positively correlated with willingness to adopt climate actions 
(19,

.
To the extent that governments continue to rely on people's voluntary reduction, it is essential to enable individual behavior change to reduce emissions by making carbon footprint more transparent. To this end, personal carbon footprint calculators inform people about the GHG emissions based on their consumption and lifestyle choices. In a sense these calculators have been used as a public education tool to raise people's awareness of their personal carbon footprint. Existing versions-available for use on the internet and within smart phone applications-have extensive variability in the domains covered, level of detail included, constant factors assumed, and additional features provided. Despite their common use and the growing literature about ways to improve the calculators (e.g., 
[24]
[25]
[26]
, there is a dearth of research investigating behavioral outcomes associated with the calculators.


Previous research on carbon calculators
By the mid 2000s, carbon calculators were becoming prevalent, along with substantial criticism regarding transparency, consistency, and data quality (27). As climate mitigation has become increasingly urgent, there are few large-scale attempts to quantify the impact of these calculators. A recent review identified only seven papers that measured the effect of calculators on mitigation behaviors and intentions and found support for the use of calculators to increase knowledge and awareness about carbon emissions but not to change behavior (28). For example, one randomized control trial examined the effect of face-to-face carbon calculator interviews on people's attitudes, electricity consumption, vehicle mileage, and flights over a two-year period (29). The study found that climate awareness and concern increased in the calculator condition relative to the control condition, but there were no significant differences on any of the behavioral measures. However, this study may have suffered from a self-selection bias where participants have already adopted most of the lifestyle adjustments prior to the study. Another study compared the use of a carbon calculator to a personal carbon footprint management system and found that the footprint management led to a significant reduction in emissions over time, but there was no control condition in the study and the convenience sample of 66 undergraduate students were not randomly assigned to the two conditions (30). Other experiments tested carbon calculators by giving participants bogus, randomly assigned feedback, showing that "worse than peers" or "negative" feedback produced greater pro-environmental intentions driven by social comparisons and mediated by eco-guilt (31-34). Other studies used within-subject longitudinal designs but without a control condition, and found improved knowledge and awareness on emissions, increased reduction intentions, and lower emissions below the baseline (35-38).
Limitations in the existing studies on calculators include small sample sizes, convenience sampling of undergraduate students and people with pre-existing interests in climate change, absence of control conditions and randomization, lack of consideration for which features of the calculator are most effective, and limited effect on behavioral outcomes. These limitations preclude drawing causal conclusions on the impact of carbon calculator on intended behavior change.
Despite these limitations, there are more serious reservations on using personal carbon calculators as a tool to mitigate climate change. The reasoning is that calculators put too much emphasis on individual behavior change and reduce people's support for broader system change (39). This reasoning is supported by past studies that demonstrated backfiring effects of a green nudge that increased individual pro-environmental behaviors but simultaneously reduced support for climate policy. For example, one study showed that nudging people to choose renewable energy by using defaults reduced their support for a carbon tax policy (40). However, a recent meta-analysis found positive spillovers for most pro-environmental behaviors where engaging in the first pro-environmental behavior actually increased the likelihood to engage in a second behavior, but there was a small negative spillover if the second behavior was policy support (41).
This said, no study in the past has examined the impact of carbon calculators on civic climate action (e.g., policy support, voting). Thus far, there is no empirical evidence to support the hesitations to use personal carbon calculators as a tool to mitigate climate change.


The current study
The current pre-registered study aims to examine the causal impact of personalized feedback on emissions from a carbon calculator on intended climate action. This study addresses the limitations in the previous literature by using a randomized controlled trial with participants from the general public that targets a specific feature of the calculator (i.e., personalized feedback) and measures change in intended individual climate action as well as civic climate action on system change. We hypothesize that people who receive personalized feedback from a carbon calculator (including their past carbon footprint, a breakdown of emissions by consumption domain, a personal reduction target, and tailored recommendations) will have a greater reduction in intended emissions in the future, compared to those who do not receive this feedback. In addition to measuring private behavioral intentions following calculator use, we will also examine potential spillover effects to pro-climate civic intentions and carbon offsetting. This study thus will provide first evidence on the spillover effect of carbon calculators on civic climate action. Using a validated eco-guilt measure (42), we will also examine whether footprint information increases eco-guilt and how eco-guilt is related to climate action. This is building upon past work that showed eco-guilt is associated with pro-environmental intentions and actions (42-45) and may be a strong predictor for climate mitigation behavior and policy support (46).
Finally, we want to see if the personalized feedback would change perceived climate mitigation responsibilities for consumers, businesses, and governments. In particular, highlighting personal carbon footprint may increase perceived mitigation responsibilities for consumers.


Methods
The current study was pre-registered on Open Science Framework (OSF) and is available at: https://osf.io/udw34. The study was approved by the University of British Columbia's Behavioral Research Ethics Board (ID Number: H20-03875) and all participants provided written, informed consent prior to beginning the study. All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.1.1. The dataset and the R code are available on OSF:
https://osf.io/p5xvc/?view_only=5601a73fae4349fe958b491b44b5f8bf.


Participants
Data collection occurred between January 26 th and February 2 nd , 2022, after the economy began to open post-COVID-19 and prior to inflation setting in. A total of 972 participants completed the study without failing any attention checks. Based on our pre-registered exclusion criteria (see SI.3), a final sample of 790 participants were included in the analysis. This exceeded the minimum sample of 676 required to detect an effect size of d=0.25 with alpha=0.05 and power=0.9 based on an a priori power analysis conducted in G*Power for a two-tailed independent-samples t-test. We recruited participants in the U.S. or Canada on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online platform where participants get paid for completing various online surveys. MTurk is a widely used platform for distributing online experiments to large samples (47,48), is decently representative of the general U.S. or Canadian populations (49,50), and a large number of psychology experiments have been replicated on MTurk (51-54). In our study, we required an MTurk approval rate greater than or equal to 95% as this is a recommended cut-off to improve data quality and avoid inattentive responses (55,56).
Participants were on average middle aged (M=39.33 years old, SD=12.21), white (78.10%), and politically left leaning (48.61% liberal, 35.06% conservative). The sample was a slight majority female (51.77%). Participants were highly educated with 71.52% having completed at least a bachelor's degree and the median household income was $50,000-60,000 USD. Most people (74.68%) identified as either concerned or alarmed about climate change on Swim and Geiger's (2017) single-item self-assessment of climate concern and 49.37% felt quite or very worried about climate change. There were no significant differences between conditions on any of these demographic measures (p's>.05, see SI.4).


Materials and procedure
We used a randomized between-subjects experimental design with two conditions (feedback vs. control) to measure the effect of personalized carbon emissions information on subsequent climate-relevant behavioral intentions. Participants were randomly assigned to either the feedback condition or the control condition. In both conditions, participants first reported their past consumption behaviors in 2019 in domains of food, transportation, housing, and material purchases by using a personal carbon calculator (see SI.1). In the feedback condition, participants then received information on their total carbon emissions in 2019 (in CO 2e ), a visualization of the emission breakdown by consumption domain, a 50% emissions reduction target, and two personalized recommendations for emissions reduction based on the participant's top two domains with the largest emissions in 2019 out of four (food, driving, flying, and clothing). The emission calculation was based on geographically appropriate data sources given the participant's location (see SI.2). Participants in the control condition did not receive any information. Afterward, participants in both conditions indicated their future consumption intentions in 2023 using the same carbon calculator. At the end of the study, participants in both conditions answered a question on purchasing carbon offsets, and completed a questionnaire on eco-guilt, civic intentions, perceived climate mitigation responsibility, and demographics (see SI.1).


Measures


Change in carbon footprint (ΔCO2e)
. This is the primary pre-registered measure which is the change in total CO2e between 2019 and 2023, calculated as 2023 intended carbon footprint minus 2019 reported carbon footprint. The questions in the carbon calculator consisted of domains on home (house type and number of residents), transportation (driving and flying), food (weekly servings consumed of high emission food categories), and material purchases (clothing and technology items, see SI.1). The calculations used geographically relevant data for the prices of gasoline and diesel, the carbon intensity of the electricity grid, and the average energy use of different types of homes (see SI.2). The emissions for all the domains were summed up to form a single measure in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e ) both for the 2019 actions and the 2023 intentions. The rest of the measures below are all exploratory.


Carbon offset allocation.
Participants were informed that one participant from the study would be selected at random to earn a $100 bonus, and they indicated how much of $100 they would like to allocate to carbon offsets if they were selected to win the bonus (see SI.1 part 4).
This was a real behavioral measure of climate action as in past studies participants say they will donate more in a hypothetical scenario than they actually do when presented with bonus money (58). There are increasingly calls to use more real behavioral measures in environmental research as opposed to hypothetical choices (59,60). We randomly selected one participant and provided them with money at MTurk and spent the rest on buying carbon offsets from the Gold Standard Project (a wind power project in India) according to the participant's allocation.
Eco-guilt. Eco-guilt was assessed on a 5-item measure originally developed by Mallett (2012) and adapted by Moore and Yang (2020) (42,44). The items measured participants' guilt associated with actions (Cronbach's alpha=0.91, see SI.1 part 5).


Civic intentions.
We measured intention to engage in seven pro-climate civic actions in the next year: donate to an environmental non-profit; email or write a letter to one of their elected officials about their support for climate change policy; sign a petition to stop subsidizing the oil and gas industry; avoid purchasing products from companies that are environmentally irresponsible; attend a virtual or in-person climate rally; volunteer with an environmental group; and vote (if applicable) for candidates or political parties based on the strength of their climate action plans. These measures aimed to capture spillover effects to civic climate actions beyond individual actions (Cronbach's alpha=0.90, see SI.1 part 6).


Perceived mitigation responsibility.
We measured perceived mitigation responsibilities for various groups of people and organizations (see SI.1 part 7).


Demographic covariates.
We collected demographic information including age, gender, political orientation, household income, and climate attitudes (see SI.1 part 8).


Results


Pre-registered analyses
Our pre-registered hypothesis is that participants in the feedback condition will have a larger decrease in emissions from 2019 to 2023 than those in the control condition. The preregistered analysis was to compare the change in emissions (ΔCO2e = total CO2e in 2023 -total CO2e in 2019) between the two conditions. 
Figure 1
 presents total emissions by condition and consumption domain in 2019 and 2023. In the feedback condition, the average emissions change was -1.42 tCO2e (12.60%) per capita (SD=5.34 tCO2e) from 11.27 tCO2e in 2019 to 9.85 tCO2e in tCO2e (0.045%) per capita (SD=4.92 tCO2e) from 11.18 tCO2e in 2019. The difference between the two conditions was significant t(788)=4.03, p<.001, d=0.29, 95% CI [0.15, 0.43]. Because assumptions of normality were violated in our data (Shapiro-Wilk: W=0.83, p<.001), we also conducted a Mann-Whitney U test as per pre-registration. The median emissions change was -0.99 tCO2e in the feedback condition and -0.06 tCO2e in the control condition and the difference was also significant (W=96244, p<.001, rrb=.236). These results suggest that participants in the feedback condition showed a larger intended reduction in emissions than those in the control condition, thus supporting the hypothesis. The largest reductions were found in domains of driving and food. More analyses on domain comparisons are shown in SI.5 and SI.6. To examine the robustness of this effect, we conducted 12 sensitivity analyses (see SI.7)
that examined percent change, participants above or below the median footprint, liberals, conservatives, and with additional inclusions and exclusions on the sample (e.g., including those in the top or bottom 5%, excluding those with footprint changes greater than 10 tCO2e). All analyses showed that the two conditions were statistically significant based on both parametric and non-parametric tests with similar effect sizes, demonstrating robust reduction effects from the feedback.


Exploratory analyses
Given the significant difference in emissions change, we further investigated which domains might be responsible for this difference. There were significant differences in ΔCO2e in the domains of food, transportation, clothing, and technology where the feedback condition had a larger decrease in emissions than the control condition, but housing had no difference (see SI.6).
On average flying emissions did not differ either (SI.5). We also examined whether reductions occurred in the domains where participants received the personalized recommendations.
Participants who received the recommendation showed significant reductions in emissions for the driving and food domains, but not for the flying or clothing domains (see SI.8). These results reveal the boundary conditions of the effect where housing and flying decisions were less malleable with feedback.
Regarding purchasing carbon offsets, the mean offset was $34.01 (SD=$32.50) in the feedback condition and $37.44 (SD=$34.31) in the control condition, which were not significantly different t(788)=1.44, p=.15; d=0.10, 95% CI [-0.04, 0.24] ( 
Figure 2
). This suggests that the feedback on carbon emissions did not influence carbon offsetting decisions. However, higher carbon offsets were associated with higher levels of eco-guilt (r≥.37. p<.001), intentions to engage in more civic actions (r≥.53, p<.001), and higher climate concern (r≥.20, p<.001) for both conditions (see SI.9 correlation matrices). This also provides validation for this new offset measure in relation to existing measures of climate concern and conceptually relevant intentions and emotions. The average intention to engage in the seven civic climate actions in the feedback condition was 3.09 (SD=1.03) out of 5 and 3.22 in the control condition (SD=1.03). The difference was not significant t(788)=1.72, padj.=.69; d=0. 
12
 Also, more eco-guilt was correlated with a greater reduction in emissions from 2019 to 2023 in the feedback condition (see SI.9). For perceived climate mitigation responsibility, there was no significant difference between conditions (p's>.3) on perceived responsibilities for consumers, companies, or governments (see SI.13). Finally, we did qualitative coding of participant reactions to the carbon emissions information and recommendations in the feedback condition.
Most participants thought the carbon footprint information was accurate and useful, and the recommendations were feasible, but a minority of participants expressed that the 50% carbon reduction goal would be difficult if not impossible to achieve (see SI.14).


General discussion
The current study examined the impact of personalized feedback on emissions from a carbon calculator on intended climate action. We found that participants who received the feedback showed a larger reduction (-12.60%) in intended GHG emissions than those in the control condition (+0.045%) from 2019 to 2023. This is the first evidence that demonstrates the efficacy of personalized feedback on emissions in influencing behavioral intentions in a randomized controlled trial. The 12.60% reduction was sizeable given that it was from a single intervention involving only feedback, whereas a recent model estimated that 90 household behavior changes would collectively reduce GHG emissions by 25% in the European Union based on plausible levels of uptake and upstream influences on the supply chain 
(8)
. Although the reduction in the current study was based on behavioral intentions, it may predict meaningful actual behavior change over the long term (61).
The additional sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of this effect. Of particular interest, the feedback intervention was effective for people with above average and below average carbon emissions, and for both liberals and conservatives, indicating this intervention is effective for a wide range of groups.
The personalized feedback reduced emissions in domains of transportation, food, and material purchases, but not housing. Largest reductions were found in domains of driving and food, with modest reductions in material purchases (clothing and technology). There was virtually no change in flying emissions. This suggests that decisions on driving, food, clothing and technology purchases were more malleable to change based on feedback, but housing decisions (e.g., where to live, the type of homes) and flying were more difficult to change with feedback. The reason for a lack of change in housing emissions is that we did not offer recommendations on housing, so people were not informed about how to change their housing choices. Another reason is that housing decisions are too complicated and consequential for the feedback intervention. The reason for a lack of change in flying emissions could be due to the rebound effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, where people may feel more motivated to fly in 2023 after the travel restrictions in the pandemic.
Participants in the feedback condition received two tailored recommendations based on their top two highest-emission domains in 2019. When they received recommendations on driving and food choices, their intended emissions decreased in 2023 compared to those who did not receive these recommendations. However, emissions did not change when participants received recommendations on flying or clothing choices. This could be due to the greater motivation to fly in 2023, especially for medium and long flights (see SI.5), or the need to buy new clothes for more in-person meetings in 2023. Since the recommendations were not randomized, this is not causal evidence for tailored recommendations.
Since personalized feedback contained many components (total emissions in 2019, a breakdown by domain, a 50% emissions reduction target, and tailored recommendations), at this point we do not know which component had the largest impact on emissions reductions. Future studies are needed to tease out which component is more effective at reducing future emissions.
An important finding in the current study is that the feedback did not have a negative spillover effect on civic climate action (e.g., signing petitions, contacting politicians, voting, joining a climate rally). This provides the first empirical evidence to challenge the view that information from the carbon calculator places too much emphasis on individual behavior change and reduces people's support for broader system change. Instead, the study shows that feedback from the carbon calculator reduces future intended emissions without impacting system-changing behaviors. This suggests that carbon calculators with personalized feedback can be an effective tool to reduce emissions to mitigate climate change.
For civic climate action, factors such as eco-guilt, climate concern, climate worry, and education level seemed to be relevant. These correlations provide useful insights for developing interventions to increase system-changing actions that target specific emotions and concerns about climate change. It is also encouraging to see that people with larger footprints are more likely to engage in civic climate action. This suggests that interventions can be targeted to these high-emitters to increase system-changing actions. Climate concern was more predictive of intentions to engage in civic actions than in individual private actions. This aligns with longitudinal research indicating that belief in climate change predicts support for government policies but not individual-level pro-environmental behavior (62).
The feedback did not influence eco-guilt, suggesting the behavioral change was not driven by an emotional response. This finding was not consistent with previous studies where negative feedback in a carbon calculator induced guilt (31-33). This may be due to the fact that we did not tell participants how they ranked compared to others as in previous studies. We did find that higher levels of eco-guilt were associated with greater civic intentions, which replicates prior research on the association between guilt and support for environmental groups (33).


Future directions
In addition to the future studies suggested above, we propose a few more directions for future investigation. Since some participants indicated that the 50% emissions reduction goal was impossible or too difficult, we suggest that recommendations should be tailored to the circumstances of the individual (e.g., depending on their financial status). Co-benefits of proclimate actions (e.g., health, finances, stress, see 63) can be emphasized within the recommendations to increase the appeal. Future studies should track objective behavioral outcomes over a longer time scale (59,64) since immediate pro-climate responses to footprint information may dissipate over time 
(32,
38)
. Other populations beyond MTurk should be considered, especially the younger groups who are unlikely to be locked into lifestyle constraints like vehicles and home ownership, are actively developing their world views and habits, and will carry much of the climate burden in the future 
(23)
. Carbon calculators can be tested in conjunction with different hypothetical policy changes to gauge how people react if infrastructure and urban planning become better designed to facilitate low-carbon lives.


Conclusions
Personalized feedback on carbon emissions has the potential to greatly reduce GHG emissions without impacting intentions to engage in system-changing actions on climate change.
The findings provide useful implications for designing strategies to help people shift toward more sustainable lifestyles and encourage climate action. Including carbon calculators with personalized feedback in high school science lessons about climate change would be an effective next step to help address the shortcomings in current curricula where high-impact actions are often ignored 
(9)
. Governments could also use this tool as part of a national climate plan to inform citizens about personal mitigation actions while simultaneously soliciting input about the necessary infrastructure and policies to support these changes (65). Although carbon calculators do not present a panacea for climate change, they could empower individuals in the immediate future to reduce their personal emissions and help reach sustainability goals. Concurrently, broader systemic transformations remain essential as the behavior change intentions fall well short of the 50% emission reduction required in North America over the next eight years.

SI.2: Carbon calculator data sources
These are the data sources and calculations used in determining the 2019 and 2023 carbon footprints. Each external source includes a link to the webpage or database. First, there are some caveats and assumptions to note within each of the domains. Also note that the footprint is a consumption footprint, not a total per capita footprint. For example, we have not included any measures to reflect use of public services (e.g., education and healthcare) which in countries with a strong public sector is a sizeable amount if distributed per capita.
Household energy use. This estimate assumes that all home energy (heating, cooling, hot water, etc.) is provided by electricity (which ignores propane, natural gas, etc.) at the average carbon intensity of the state. We do not account for behaviors (e.g., thermostat settings, short showers, etc.), energy efficiency of appliances, home refurbishments (e.g., insulation, heat pumps, etc.), or personal renewable power (e.g., solar panels).
Air travel. There is a wide range of estimates for flight emissions in existing databases such that some sources provide estimates four times larger than others. Also, for each flight length category we have based our estimate on a single flight within that category as an approximation but depending on the type of plane and the exact route, these numbers could vary extensively.
Car travel. The annual car travel emissions are based only on gasoline and diesel consumption and do not factor in any of the "make phase" of automobiles. Additionally, participants with electric vehicles have a footprint of 0 in this domain which ignores the production emissions and electricity usage of such vehicles.
Food. The estimates for each individual food group vary immensely across sources and by using mean values for each category from a meta-analysis we do not capture this. We have also ignored some categories (e.g., fruit, vegetables, grains, legumes, etc.) because they are low emissions but this does mean we are underestimating food footprints.
Technology. For technology purchases we have only included 1 year of use phase emissions and also divided the make phase emissions by the expected life span. We did not provide a footprint with the entire make phase as this can mislead consumers into keeping old technology even when newer upgrades may compensate for make phase emissions by having substantially improved efficiency and thus lower use phase emissions.
Missing categories. There are also domains that this calculator does not include such as low-frequency high-emission purchases (e.g., furniture, appliances, etc.) as well as lifestyle activities outside the home (hotels, restaurants, etc.) Many online carbon calculators add a constant to each person's footprint to account for these and we did not. We chose only to portray to participants the footprints from what we calculated and not use any scaling functions.
Valid response range. We set validation criteria within Qualtrics to ensure that numeric responses were within a reasonable range. We only accepted responses within the following ranges: 1-10 people in a home, $0-1000 USD on gasoline per month, $0-1000 USD on diesel per month, 0-20 annual flights within each length category (short, medium, long, very long), 0-70 portions of each food category per week (e.g., servings of red meat, cups of coffee), 0-30 items of clothing purchased annually per category (e.g., tops, bottoms), and 0-5 items of technology purchased annually per category (e.g., smartphone, laptop). Participants who input numbers outside this range received an error message indicating what the accepted range was and had to adjust their response before proceeding.  Calculations Convert dollars spent on gas/diesel to gas/diesel volume using regional gas prices.
Convert volume to emissions. 


SI.3: Recruitment and inclusion/exclusion criteria
Recruitment on MTurk occurred between January 26th and February 2nd, 2022. The survey was expected to take 15 minutes and participants received $1.00 USD in compensation for their participation. This payment was conditional upon participants providing an accurate response on all attention checks within the survey and they were made aware of this stipulation prior to consenting. Our target minimum sample size of 676 participants was based on an a priori power analysis conducted in G*Power for a two-tailed independent t-test assuming a minimum effect size of d = 0.25, alpha error = 0.05 and power = 0.9. We chose d = 0.25 as a relatively small effect that is in line with some preliminary findings from Büchs et al. (2018) on the effect size of a carbon calculator interview on electricity use (d = 0.13) and flights (d = 0.21), though these findings were not significant at alpha = .05.
The study was vaguely described as a "survey regarding your lifestyle in the past years and some of the activities you plan to do in the future" to minimize demand characteristics and avoid recruiting a biased sample. Participants were explicitly told they had to pass all attentions checks to receive payment. Participants were ensured that all data would be stripped of any identifying information before it was uploaded to online forums to ensure confidentiality and anonymity. After reading the advertisement for the study on MTurk, participants clicked on a link that directed them to the survey, where they read the online consent form.
The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the preregistration for this study. These criteria were determined in advance to provide explicit rationale for a) selecting participants to join the study and b) removing participants from the analyses.
Inclusion: To participate in the study participants needed to be 18 year of age or older, fluent in in English, and residing in Canada or the United States.
Exclusion: Participants were excluded if they had participated in pilot testing of the carbon calculator used in this study (i.e., MTurk accounts that participated in the testing were not be able to join the current study). We also excluded anyone who failed to complete the entire survey or incorrectly answered any of the four attention check questions. Two of these attention checks were multiple choice questions asking a basic comprehension question about the instructions and the other two were items within a question matrix that explicitly told participants to select a given response. Participants were excluded if the survey had already been completed by the same IP address to avoid duplicate responses when one person holds multiple Mturk accounts. Participants were excluded if they re-started the survey (i.e., any duplicated subject number resulted in all attempts for that subject being discarded) because people who learn about their footprint or subsequent tasks in the survey will no longer be naive when restarting the survey. Participants were excluded if they completed the survey in less than 5 minutes or more than 45 minutes. In less than five minutes we did not believe participants could have read and comprehended the material presented and in over 45 minutes the participants were likely distracted and extraneous factors (e.g., looking up more information) that we could not control for became a greater possibility. Lastly, participants were excluded if their carbon footprint in 2019 was either below the 5th percentile or above the 95th percentile of their condition (i.e., the top and bottom 5% in the control group and in the feedback group were excluded) to minimize the influence of outliers on the analyses. Any outliers that met the above criteria were still included in the main the analysis but were removed in subsequent sensitivity analyses.


SI.4: Demographics
Most participants answered all of the demographic questions. The only questions with missing data were age (one participant did not answer and one input 252 which was recoded as NA) and education (one participant did not answer). Age was measured as a continuous, openresponse variable in years. Gender options were selected from a multiple-choice list and for statistical analyses, "man" was coded as 0 and all other responses ("woman", "non-binary", "transgender", "two spirited", "other", "prefer not to say") were coded as 1. Political orientation was measured on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly liberal, 7 = strongly conservative). Household income was measured in $10,000 increments up to $100,000 with one higher category of "more than $100,000". We used a single item developed by Swim and Geiger (2017) to assess climate concern. Participants self-categorized into the six segments (1 = dismissive, 2 = doubtful, 3 = disengaged, 4 = cautious, 5 = concerned, 6 = alarmed). As many participants fall in the upper categories of this scale (i.e., concerned and alarmed), we additionally measured climate worry on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all worried, 2 = a little worried, 3 = somewhat worried, 4 = quite worried, 5 = very worried) as this was a more sensitive measure in pilot studies. The difference in age is very small and statistically not significant (difference = -0.01 years, 95% CI [-1.70, 1.72], t(786) = 0.02, p = .987; d = 1.18e-03, 95% CI [-0.14, 0.14]). Based on a gender binary of "male-identifying" vs. "not male-identifying", 49.74% of control group participants identified as men and 43.41% of feedback group participants identified as men but this was not a significant difference between groups, X 2 (1) = 2.9, p = .088. The groups did not differ in ethnicity, X 2 (1) = 0.41, p = .522, with participants identifying as white making up 79.21% of the control group and 77.07% of the feedback group. Both groups were left leaning politically with 49.21% in the control group and 48.05% in the feedback group identifying as liberal. The very small difference in ratings on the 7-point scale was not significant, t(788) = -0.43, p = .666; d = -0.03, 95% CI 
[-0.17, 0.11]
. The median household income in both groups was $50,000-60,000 USD and a Mann-Whitney U test indicated there were no significant differences (W = 75558, p = .462, rrb = -.030). Both groups were highly educated with 72.63% in the control group and 70.49% in the feedback group having completed at least a bachelor's degree, and the difference between groups was not significant, X 2 (1) = 0.42, p = .517. The independent sample t-test for climate concern (measured on a 6 point scale) suggested that the difference between groups was very small and not significant, t(788) = 1.12, p = .263; d = 0.08, 95% CI 
[-0.06, 0.22]
. Similarly, the independent sample t-test for climate worry showed no significant group differences, t(788) = 0.66, p = .509; d = 0.05, 95% CI [-0.09, 0.19]. These balance checks demonstrate that the two groups were comparable in every demographic dimension measured.
The mean completion time for the entire study was 13.35 minutes (SD = 7.08). There were significant group differences in this time given that the feedback condition involved reading and responding to content about their carbon footprint, t(788) = -5.49, p < .001. The average completion time in the control group (M = 11.94, SD = 6.41) was almost 3 minutes shorter than the feedback group (M = 14.66, SD = 7.42). Significant differences between control and feedback groups: **p<.01; ***p<.001 (independent-sample ttests for means and Mann-Whitney U tests for medians). The parametric and non-parametric p values were corrected with Bonferroni correction.

SI.7: Sensitivity analyses
We conducted multiple sensitivity analyses to ensure our main pre-registered analysis was robust. These analyses included four variations with the same participants: (i) analyzing percentage change in carbon footprint instead of absolute change, (ii) comparing participants with large and small footprints separately (above vs. below the median), (iii) comparing the effect in liberals vs. conservatives, and (iv) excluding the housing domain as we did not provide feedback targeting choices about home type or number of people in the home. There was one added analysis with a larger sample (and more outliers) than the main analysis where we included participants who were initially removed for having footprints in the top/bottom 5%. There were also five additional analyses with added exclusion criteria: (i) excluding all participants with a total footprint change greater than +/-10t; (ii) excluding all participants with extreme changes in CO2e within any consumption domain (more than 3 standard deviations from the mean in any domain); (iii) excluding participants with any suspicious activity detected by Qualtrics (e.g., bots and fraudulent responding); (iv) excluding all participants with a 2019 CO2e above 25 tons; (v) excluding all participants using a stricter time cut-off 59 seconds shorter (this was based on how completion time was calculated, see below). The following table includes the parametric and non-parametric tests for each sensitivity analysis with effect sizes greater than or equal to the original analysis bolded. 


Calculating time cut-off
One of our pre-registered exclusion criteria was a minimum completion time of 5 minutes. However, we did not have precise data for the total seconds participants spent on the carbon calculator portion of the survey and had to make a rounding estimate. For the main analysis we used a more lenient assumption and in a sensitivity analysis we applied a more stringent version (59 seconds shorter). The main analysis includes participants and the sensitivity analysis with the shorter cut-off included 735 participants.
We had the exact duration (in seconds) that participants spent on the Qualtrics portion of the survey but for the first webpage of the survey (that hosted the carbon calculator) we only had the time they began the calculator (to the nearest second) and the later time they began the Qualtrics portion (the minute they began with no data on seconds). We used the following calculation:
Completion time = duration (sec) on Qualtrics + estimated duration (sec) on calculator Estimated duration on calculator = (Qualtrics start time + 59 seconds) -Calculator start time For example, if a participant was recorded as starting the calculator at 3:30:15 and the Qualtrics survey at 3:33:00, the true start time of the Qualtrics could be anywhere between 3:33:00 to 3:33:59. Thus the participant's time on the calculator portion could range from 2min 45s to 3min 44s. In the main analysis we considered their time 3min 44s and in the sensitivity analysis this would be considered 2min 45s. This estimated calculator completion time was then added to the exact duration in seconds spent on the Qualtrics survey and this was used for the 5minute and 45-minute screening criteria.


SI.8: Recommendation specific changes
We examined whether emissions changes occurred in the domain where participants received recommendations. Participants in the feedback condition received of 4 recommendations (food, driving, flying, clothing) based on their highest-emission domains in 2019. We conducted oneway ANOVAs and also Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare three groups: the control group, people in the feedback group who received a specific recommendation, and people in the feedback who did not receive the recommendation. There are two important caveats in this analysis. First, the three groups are not equal in size. Second, this is not a truly "experimental" comparison because the recommendations were not randomized but instead provided based on what changes would be most meaningful for the given individual. Therefore, people who had high initial scores in a given domain received the recommendation and the measured differences could be partially explained by regression to the mean.
Driving recommendation. Participants who received the driving recommendation had an intended decrease in their driving footprint by 1.85 tCO2e (SD = 4.60 tCO2e, n = 343) compared to an increase of 0.46 tCO2e (SD = 2.05 tCO2e, n = 67) for those who did not receive the recommendation, and a decrease of 0.17 tCO2e (SD = 4.03 tCO2e, n = 380) in the control group. The one way ANOVA was significant (F(2, 787) = 18.02, p < .001; η 2 = 0.04) and Tukey HSD showed that the recommendation group was different from the control and the not-recommended groups (p < .001), but that the control and not-recommended were not different. A Kruskal-Wallis test indicated significant differences (H(2) = 103, p < .001, ε² = 0.13) and pairwise Mann-Whitney comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment found all three groups were significantly different (p < .001).
Food recommendation. Participants who received the food recommendation had the largest intended decrease in food footprint (M = -0.24 tCO2e, SD = 0.89 tCO2e, n = 315) compared to a decrease of 0.0031 tCO2e (SD = 0.65 tCO2e, n = 95) for the not-recommended group and an increase of 0.070 tCO2e (SD = 1.01 tCO2e, n = 380) in the control group. The one way ANOVA was significant (F(2, 787) = 9.99, p < .001; η 2 = 0.02) and Tukey HSD showed that only the recommendation group and control group were significantly different (p<.001). A Kruskal-Wallis test indicated significant differences (H(2) = 66, p<.001, ε² = 0.08) and pairwise Mann-Whitney comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment found all three groups were significantly different (p<.05).
Flying recommendation. Those receiving the flying recommendation intended to decrease their flying footprint slightly (M = -0.0042 tCO2e, SD = 2.44 tCO2e, n = 123) while participants without the recommendation increased by 0.17 tCO2e (SD = 0.77 tCO2e, n = 287) and those in the control group increased by 0.17 tCO2e (SD = 1.66 tCO2e, n = 380). The ANOVA was not significant (F(2, 787) = 0.62, p = .538; η 2 = 0.0016).
Clothing recommendation. The largest magnitude intended decrease was in the recommendation group (M = -0.12 tCO2e, SD = 0.18 tCO2e, n = 39). The no-recommendation group also intended to decrease (M = -0.040 tCO2e, SD = 0.18 tCO2e, n = 371) while the control group intended to increase (M = 0.027 tCO2e, SD = 0.19 tCO2e, n = 380). There were significant


SI.9: Correlation matrices
For interpreting the correlations, the following coding was used. Higher politics score indicates more conservative. Higher education score is more educated. Higher climate concern score is more concerned about climate change. Larger intended footprint change indicates a larger intended increase in emissions from 2019 to 2023 (or a smaller intended decrease if only looking at participants with intentions to decrease). The "COVID-index" score is a proxy for the level of covid lockdown in the state where the participant lives and higher scores indicate lower levels of lockdown. This is measured using EIA data on 2020 gasoline consumption divided by 2019 gasoline consumption (higher scores indicate gasoline consumption remained closer to pre-COVID levels during the pandemic).
In the control group many of the measures that we expected to be related are in fact related (including carbon offset allocation, civic intentions, eco-guilt, and climate concern). Carbon footprint in 2019 (and in 2023) is correlated with civic intentions and offsets such that people with larger footprints are also more interested in allocating money to offsets and doing civic actions. Those with larger footprints also experience higher eco-guilt. Intended footprint change is not correlated with anything except the COVID index. Thus, changing personal behavior in a climate friendly direction is not associated with other "climate friendly" actions like civic behaviors and carbon offsetting. Education is correlated with other variables as expected (more educated people have larger footprints, higher income, more civic intentions, etc.) and political correlations are also as anticipated (more conservative people have lower civic intentions, eco-guilt, and climate concern). Within the feedback group, the same trends in education and politics are observed, and eco-guilt, civic intentions and offsets are again correlated. Carbon footprint in 2019 is correlated with civic intentions and offsets such that people with larger footprints are also those more interested in allocating money to offsets and doing civic actions. People with larger 2023 footprints are also allocating more to carbon offsets. Intended footprint change is correlated with eco-guilt, civic intentions, climate concern and climate worry. People who experienced more guilt, intend to do more civic actions, and are more concerned/worried about climate change have a "smaller" intended footprint change (which means a larger decrease in emissions from 2019 to 2023). 


SI.10: Civic intention by item
To further investigate the impact of feedback on civic intentions, we examined the group differences on each of the seven items that were included in the civic intentions. The seven items were participants' likelihood to engage in the following actions in the next year: donate to an environmental non-profit; email or write a letter to one of their elected officials about their support for climate change policy; sign a petition to stop subsidizing the oil and gas industry; avoid purchasing products from companies that are environmentally irresponsible; attend a virtual or in-person climate rally; volunteer with an environmental group; and vote (if applicable) for candidates or political parties based on the strength of their climate action plans. After applying Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, none of the tests was significant.  


SI.11: Regressions
We conducted two regressions: for emissions change and civic intentions. Both had the same predictors (demographic covariates, 2019 footprint, and eco-guilt). Civic intentions had the emissions change as a predictor. The feedback condition is a significant predictor for emissions change, such that those in the feedback condition have an intended footprint change 1.42 tonnes lower (trending towards a decrease in emissions) than the control. Climate concern is significant in both models. Scoring 1 point higher on the 6-point climate concern scale is associated with a 0.39 tCO2e decrease in intended emission change and also with increased intentions to perform civic actions. Education is only a significant predictor for civic intentions, such that people with higher levels of education have greater civic intentions. A one tCO2e increase in 2019 carbon footprint predicts a 0.23 tCO2e decrease in emissions and slightly higher civic intentions. Eco-guilt only significantly predicts civic intentions with a score 1 higher on eco-guilt corresponding to a score 0.33 higher on civic intentions. Lastly, the COVID-index predicts emissions change, such that less lockdown corresponds to an increase in intended footprint change.


Notes on the COVID-index
We were curious whether the level of COVID shutdown would influence intended shifts in emissions from pre-to post-pandemic. The correlation and regression results using the COVID-proxy indicate there is a relationship, though it is small. People living in states that had less of a COVID-shutdown of the economy have higher emissions intentions.
In the control condition the correlation between covid-index and intended footprint change is positive, statistically significant, and small (r = 0.12, 95% CI [0.02, 0.22], t(378) = 2.36, p < .05). This suggests that people living in states that had high covid scores (i.e., less covid shutdown) also trend towards larger increases in footprint (i.e., more emissions). In the full correlation matrix for the control condition, the only other correlation is between the covid index and climate concern (r=0.12, p<.05) indicating less shut down is related to higher climate concern. In the feedback condition, the correlation between the covid-index and intended footprint change is positive, statistically not significant, and tiny (r = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.05, 0.14], t(408) = 0.86, p = .391). There is also a negative correlation (r = -.1, p<.05) between the covid index and eco-guilt suggesting that people who experienced less lock down have lower ecoguilt. In the linear regression for intended footprint change, the covid predictor is significant (p=.0103). The slope estimate is .0427 meaning that each additional percentage point in the covid index corresponds to an intended increase of .0427 tCO2e.
One possible interpretation of these results is that people who were more impacted by the pandemic (on a state-wide scale) have perhaps changed their lifestyles and, realizing that reduced travel and consumption are feasible, are willing to keep some of these changes. This contrasts another distinct (and counter vailing) possibility we expected of a rebound effect in which people who were more restricted during the pandemic would strive for more travel post-pandemic. It also remains possible that both effects are present heterogeneously throughout the sample and that this is reducing the strength of the correlation (i.e., there are likely people reacting in both directions to the level of COVID restrictions.)


SI.12: Eco-guilt by footprint size
It was possible that there was no overall effect of condition on eco-guilt because people with small or large footprints in 2019 may have different guilt responses to receiving feedback about their footprint. If so, we would expect an interaction between footprint size in 2019 and condition. However, we did not find evidence of this interaction when running a 2x2 ANOVA (condition x footprint size). Footprint size was coded as a binary of above vs. below the median footprint in 2019. Footprint size was associated with eco-guilt such that those with higher footprints feel more guilt (F(1, 786) = 6.18, p = .013; ηp 2 = 0.008) but there was no main effect of condition (F(1, 786) = 0.24, p = .626) or interaction between condition and footprint size (F(1, 786) = 2.96, p = .086). 


SI.13: Climate mitigation responsibility
In a hypothetical scenario in which laptops were produced in China and purchased in the United States, participants rated the responsibility of 5 different groups to reduce the GHG emissions associated with the laptops. There were no group differences between control vs. feedback in attributing responsibility for emissions (p's>.3 with parametric t-tests and nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests) to any of the 5 actors. In general, across the full sample, the highest responsibility was placed on Chinese companies (M = 3.70, SD = 1.02) and the lowest on American customers (M = 3.13, SD = 1.23). This suggests that participants who received carbon footprint information were no more likely to consider individuals responsible for their consumption emissions than participants who did not receive this information. In a more general question, participants were asked to what extent different people or groups should be attempting to change their actions to help limit climate change (1 = should not change at all, 5 = should make every effort to change). The results parallel the previous question with no significant differences between the control and feedback group for any of the possible actors. This means that people who saw their footprint information did not feel that they should be making changes any more than the control group, nor do they put any different amount of responsibility on the other actors. Across the full sample, the highest responsibility was placed on companies (M = 4.11, SD = 0.10) and governments (M = 4.14, SD = 1.00) followed by wealthy Americans (M = 3.90, SD = 1.08). 


SI.14: Qualitative coding of participant reactions to footprint information and recommendations
Participants in the carbon calculator feedback condition (n = 410) were asked a number of brief questions as they received information about their footprint. When asked whether they believed their total footprint number accurately reflected their behavior in 2019, 61.0% thought it was accurate, 30.7% larger than expected, and 8.3% smaller than expected. Regarding whether the carbon footprint information was useful, the responses were: 24.4% definitely yes, 36.6% maybe yes, 22.7% unsure, 8.3% maybe no, 8.0% definitely no. Most people thought their footprint was about average for an American (47.3%) with many also thinking they were below average (29.0%), some above average (11.7%) and others admitting they had no idea (12.0%). After reviewing information about the Paris Agreement and the American pledge to reduce by 50% participants were asked if they considered their own 2019 footprint acceptable. Most people thought it was acceptable (20.5% definitely yes, 31.5% maybe yes), 26.1% were unsure, and a minority claimed their footprint was not acceptable (14.6% maybe no, 7.3% definitely no). Participants were then asked whether they thought their own personal target (i.e., 50% reduction from current level) would be attainable within the next 5-10 years. Most believed it would be possible (26.1% definitely yes, 38.5% maybe yes), 15.6% were unsure, and a sizeable minority thought it would not be possible (9.8% maybe no, 10.0% definitely no).
After each reduction recommendation, participants were asked whether it seemed feasible. Note the different sample sizes for the food recommendations occurred because some people received the food recommendation but did not consume red meat, so they did not receive the second part of the recommendation about switching to other types of meat. Also note that the total number of responses for the driving feasibility (n = 338) is 5 fewer than the total who received this recommendation due to missing data. Participants in the feedback group were also asked for their "immediate thoughts that come to mind" after viewing the breakdown of their own 2019 footprint, the text about governments pledging to reduce emissions, and their own annual personal carbon target (but before getting any specific recommendations about how to reduce). At this point the information these participants had received was the same, though the numbers differed based on the participants' 2019 behaviors. We thematically coded each open response as up to four different themes (though often only one category was identified in brief responses). There was no ranking of themes for a participant (i.e., all were considered of equal importance). All categories with fewer than three comments were coded as "other" when recoding a second time. The coding criteria and exemplar quotations are found in the following tables. There was a wide range of participant reactions to the footprint information. The most frequent response was to suggest that a 50% reduction was unrealistic and extremely challenging. However, the next three most common themes were setting a personal reduction goal, noting that GHG reduction and climate targets are important, and stating a personal reduction action (i.e., something specific they can change). Some participants indicated having no familiarity with this concept and others inquired about learning more to help them meet the goal. Brook (2011) proposed that non-environmentalist participants may have unproductive reactions to negative footprint feedback information-feeling overwhelmed that goals are unattainable, justifying actions, blaming others, trivializing their own impact, and questioning the accuracy of the footprint feedback-all of which we documented in participants' open responses but none of which were present in the majority of responses. The most common theme that emerged (18.29%) was the notion that reducing emissions and hitting a 50% reduction target was either unrealistic or incredibly challenging. Participants felt that the goal was "nearly impossible to achieve", "a bit too ambitious", "ridiculous and unreasonable", and "a wonderful fantasy but it will not be achievable." Participants explained that they could not "just drastically change [their] life" and that if they cut back on their largest domains they "would have to go without [their] most important basic necessities for day to day life." Many participants also noted how challenging the goal would be given their current lifestyle and efforts they had already taken to reduce. For example, participants wrote, "I already don't eat meat", "I don't buy new clothes" and "I have already been working for years to keep my energy consumption low."
The next three most common themes were all positive reactions to footprints: personal reduction goals including any personal commitment or intention to reduce (17.80%), comments about the importance of GHG reduction (12.93%), and personal reduction actions such as identifying specific behaviors or domains that can be reduced (8.05%). The reduction goals consisted of people stating they "could try a little harder", "need to reduce [their] footprints", "will try to change consumption patterns", "should contribute to saving the environment" and "need to be more aware of [their] actions". One participant noted that "I like the proposal and would like to reduce my carbon footprint." Regarding the importance of reducing emissions, one participant wrote, "I think everyone should try hard to make the environment better and make some changes, get serious about it before it's too late." Within this same theme, others emphasized their support for national pledges, for example writing "I am glad America is taking an initiative to help climate change." As for reduction actions, participants highlighted several areas where they plan to change such as, "drive less", "eliminate all meats and dairy from my diet", "reduce my travel", "[buy] a hybrid for my next vehicle", "purchase less clothing", and "ask my friends to follow [in reducing]". One participant explicitly based their action plan on the information provided, writing, "I'll need to reduce home energy emissions, since it was over 65% of my carbon footprint. I've been considering solar panels across my entire roof and will do some more research on this now." Another participant was encouraged by the information and wrote, "I think that I have the ability to reduce my GHG by driving less, and that gives me hope." Some participants thought the reduction target was feasible (6.34%) noting that with "changes of personal behaviors as well as technology becoming more environmental friendly, 50% is an attainable goal." Others explained that they would need more advice (5.85%), for example stating, "I would need to know some tangible things I could do to achieve this goal. I would also want to know what I could do to sequester more carbon, for example planting more trees. Finally, I would want to understand if buying carbon credits would help reduce my numbers." Other participants wanted more specific advice, for example, "I am wondering what is going to make the biggest dent in my consumption if I take it out, auto or air travel." Encouragingly, numerous participants claimed to learn something from the intervention (4.88%). For some, this was a novel topic, with participants writing "I find this information to be interesting and this is the first I have heard of it" and "That's pretty neat to find out I never really thought about my carbon footprint and how much energy or gas or anything really of that nature and it's nice to know now." Some people were most interested in what they had learnt about "what effects the number" and "how much I can reduce my emissions."
There were of course also participants who had no intention to change based on this information (4.39%) because "it's not something I'm concerned with", "[it] doesn't seem relevant to me", "I don't really care", "I'm not really motivated to change", and "this information is not useful to me at all." One participant even wrote they "would not under any circumstance cut back on any of [their] consumption." Some participants felt strongly that "instead of putting this burden on individuals, companies that are the primary polluters ought to be the ones reducing their carbon footprints". Participants blamed corporations and were angry that carbon footprints implied individuals were responsible: "I am almost offended that my personal carbon footprint should be calculated and considered in this discussion. I feel enraged in the same way when airlines remind me of my carbon emissions when selecting flights." People clearly emphasized that individuals should not be targeted, for example, "I can't help but think guilting the normal 'little guy' into worrying about their carbon footprint is another sick twisted result of our corporate run system. Of course I'd love to reduce my drop in the bucket to half a drop. But I don't think it's on me to make a real difference" and "It's not about sacrifices I make but changes to the overall way we do things in infrastructure and large business." In addition to highlighting corporations' role, participants also drew attention to other countries noting that "none of this is relevant as China and India are the biggest polluters". Lastly, a few participants wrote about their affective response to this information including experiencing "guilt for contributing to global warming" and noting that after viewing their results they "feel ashamed."
The qualitative responses participants provided underscore the fact that any carbon calculator intervention will have heterogenous effects (and acceptance) with participants both appreciating and despising the information we provided.

95% CI [-0.02, 0.26] (after correcting for multiple comparisons). None of the seven civic climate intentions was significantly different between conditions (see SI.10). Instead, civic intentions were strongly associated with eco-guilt (r≥.57, p<.001), climate concern (r≥.50, p<.001), and climate worry
(r≥.51, p<.001) for both conditions (see SI.9). Regression analyses also showed that education
level and 2019 emissions predicted civic intentions, such that people with higher education or
larger emissions in 2019 had a greater intention to engage in civic actions (see SI.11).
Levels of eco-guilt in the control condition (M=3.80, SD=1.26) and feedback condition
(M=3.75, SD=1.31) were not significantly different t(788)=0.49, p=.63; d=0.03, 95% CI [-0.11,
0.17]. This suggests that the feedback did not influence eco-guilt. This said, participants with
higher emissions in 2019 felt more eco-guilt F(1, 786)=6.18, p=.013; ηp 2 =0.008 (see SI.12).

This question is about your air travel behavior. Please enter the number of flights you took within each length category. (If you had no flights in a category, you can put 0. For a roundtrip flight, you can put 2) o Short flight one-way (under 3 hours, for example San Francisco to Seattle): o Medium flight one-way (3 to 6 hours, for example Las Vegas to New York City): o Long flight one-way (6 to 10 hours, for example Orlando, Florida to London, England): o Very long flight one-way (over 10 hours, for example Los Angeles, California to Sydney, Australia): • This question is about your food consumption. If you didn't eat some of the food categories, you can put 0. o Red meat including beef and lamb (1 serving = 110g, for example 4oz burger or half a sirloin steak): _______ o Other meat including poultry, pork, and fish (1 serving = 110g, for example a small chicken breast or a pork chop the size of your palm): _______ o Cheese (1 serving = 30g, for example 3 tablespoons of grated cheddar or 1 cheese string): _______ o Dairy milk (1 serving = 1 cup): _______ o Chocolate (1 serving = 100g bar): _______ o Coffee (1 serving = 1 cup): ______ • This question is about your clothing purchases. (If you did not buy a clothing item, you can put 0. If you purchased clothing from a thrift store or any other second hand purchases, where the clothing had a previous owner, do not count these items.) o Pairs of shoes: _____ o Tops (e.g., shirts, sweaters, jackets): _____ o Jeans: _____ o Other bottoms (e.g., shorts, sweatpants, and leggings): _____ o Dresses and suits: ____ • This question is about your technology purchases.Thank you for reflecting and providing these responses about your lifestyle. When you're ready, please continue to the next section.Based on the information you have provided, we have calculated your personal carbon footprint. This number reflects the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with your actions in 2019. Your footprint is expressed in "tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent" and includes all the main gases that contribute to climate change. Next to your total footprint you can see a breakdown by type of consumption (e.g., transportation, food, home energy, etc.) and how much each of these contributed to your total footprint.[image inserted showing a personalized pie chart of emissions from each domain. When participants hover their mouse over a section of the figure it shows the percentage and the absolute tonnes from that domain.] Your personal carbon footprint in 2019: [X] tonnes When you're ready, please continue to the next section.

Some of these choices might be easy and others might seem challenging. Hopefully they give you a better sense of some of the highest impact changes you can make. In general, animal-based foods (like meat, dairy and eggs) have higher emissions than plant-based foods and red meat has the highest emissions. Based on your diet in 2019, replacing half of your servings of meat and dairy with protein options like nuts, beans and tofu would save X metric tons per year. Alternatively, choosing to eat poultry, pork or fish instead of red meat would save X metric tons per year.• Does reducing your consumption of meat and dairy seem feasible? o 5=definitely yes, 4=maybe yes, 3=unsure, 2=maybe no, 1=definitely no • Does switching from red meats to other meats seem feasible? o 5=definitely yes, 4=maybe yes, 3=unsure, 2=maybe no, 1=definitely no Air travel is a very high emission activity. Spending holidays closer to home and teleconferencing for work whenever possible can have a big impact. Flying half as much you did in 2019 would save X metric tons per year. Taking just two fewer one-way flights across the country would save 0.54 metric tons per year.•Does reducing the number of flights you take seem feasible? o 5=definitely yes, 4=maybe yes, 3=unsure, 2=maybe no, 1=definitely no Does reducing the amount you drive seem feasible? o 5=definitely yes, 4=maybe yes, 3=unsure, 2=maybe no, 1=definitely no [4: shopping recommendation] "Fashion is a high-emission industry.

When you're ready, please continue to the next section. In this section, think ahead to the year 2023 and consider how you realistically envision your lifestyle post-COVID-19. For the purpose of this survey, you can assume that life is "normal" without any restrictions on travel or gatherings. Again, please answer the following questions to the best of your ability about your own individual behavioral intentions (not your family's behavior). Try to answer as realistically as you can about what you genuinely plan to do in 2023. How many people will live in your household (including yourself)? • What kind of house will you live in for 2023? [Single detached, single attached (row/terrace, duplex/townhouse/semi-detached), apartment in a building with 2-4 units, apartment in a building with 5+ units, mobile home] • How much money do you plan to spend on gasoline or diesel on average per month?

If you plan to drive an electric vehicle and will not purchase gasoline/diesel, you can also put 0.) o Dollars on gasoline: _____, Dollars on diesel:_____ • How many one-way flights will you take in 2023? Please enter the number of flights you will take within each length category. (If you don't plan on taking any flights in a category, you can put 0. For a roundtrip flight, you can put 2). o Short flights (under 3 hours, for example San Francisco to Seattle): Very long flights (over 10 hours, for example Los Angeles, California to Sydney, Australia): • How many servings of these foods do you plan to eat per week? If you won't eat some of the food categories, you can put 0. o Red meat including beef and lamb (1 serving = 110g, for example 4oz burger or half a sirloin steak) o Other meat including poultry, pork, and fish (1 serving = 110g, for example a small chicken breast or a pork chop the size of your palm) You also have the option to allocate some of the bonus towards carbon offsets. Carbon offsets are investments in environmental projects and are used to compensate for the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with one's lifestyle or actions. These payments go towards projects including clean energy and infrastructure upgrades that help lower GHG emissions. Spending $100USD on these projects can offset over 8 tonnes of emissions. Any money you allocate to carbon offsets will be spent on Gold Standard certified projects to reduce emissions globally and foster sustainable development opportunities. If you want to learn more, visit the Gold Standard website where you can see a range of available offset options.

[3: driving recommendation] Finding alternatives to driving can make a big difference. Carpooling and public transit are good options for longer distances and walking and biking are ideal for shorter trips. Driving half as much as you currently do would save X metric tons per year. Even just driving 62 miles (100km) less each month would save 0.275 metric tons per year.•• When answering the next questions what have we asked you to think about?

User Inputs Number of each food item/food group consumed per week User Inputs Number of smartphones, laptops, and TVs purchased Data Sources Life cycle emissions for phone and laptop based on numbers from Apple. Smartphone based on iPhone 11 and laptop based on 13-inch MacBook Pro. The years of use assumptions come from Apple. The TV is based on two resources: the annual use emissions are based on the electricity consumption of the average 50-inch TV accordingto EcoCost Savings and the remainder of the LCA (not use phase) is based on Apple's 32-inch Pro Display XDR. Average time before replacing the TV is assumed to be 7 Tops, dresses and suits, and bottoms from Carbon footprints in the textile industry; this paper compiled a literature review of LCA's of various textiles and garments and reported the footprints of the garments in CO2e. Data in the literature review for these items is from: A Carbon Footprint for UK Clothing and Opportunities for Savings. The tops are an average of 6.5kg for "tops and 13.3kg for "jackets". The bottoms are rounded from 8.7 for "bottoms". The dresses and suits are an average of 14.8kg for
