You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Introduction
Deception, including the act of lying, is a prevalent component of everyday social interactions. Despite the evident negative impacts of such behaviour on social trust within financial, political, legal, and daily-life contexts, dishonesty continues to be widespread 
(Millar & Tesser, 1988;
Nyberg, 1994
). An increasing body of studies has explored the dispositional and contextual factors that influence deception at behavioural 
(De Mazar et al., 2008;
McLeod & Genereux, 2008;
Mead et al., 2009;
Panasiti et al., 2011)
, bodily 
(Panasiti et al., 2016)
, and neural 
(Dupont et al, 2023;
Panasiti et al., 2014)
 levels. Despite these advances, our understanding of the interplay between emotions and moral decision-making, particularly in the context of dishonesty, remains an underexplored area in the literature.
The influence of emotional experience on decision-making can be investigated on two main levels. On one level, the act of making decisions can evoke emotions, known as integral emotions, which in turn shape the decision-making process. For instance, recent findings suggest that feeling anxious about a decision's potential outcomes can lead to individuals to prefer less risky options, suggesting that integral emotions can serve as a strong guides for personal and social decisions 
(Greene & Haidt, 2002)
. On another level, emotions elicited by unrelated events, called incidental emotions, may carry over to the subsequent decision-making event, modulating it in different ways according to the experienced emotion's features 
(Lerner et al., 2015)
. The impact of incidental emotions has been extensively studied in the context of moral judgments, particularly through the use of moral dilemmas 
(Gawronski et al., 2018;
Szekely & Miu, 2015)
. However, their role in the domain of dishonest behaviour remains under-examined. The present study aims to examine how some of these incidental emotions specifically influence dishonest decision-making behaviours, with a particular focus on lying.
Several models of emotion-cognition interaction have begun to shed light on the mechanisms by which incidental emotions affect decision-making 
(Lerner et al., 2015)
. Initial models primarily focused on the negative or positive nature of emotions, known as valence-based approaches. The Affect Infusion Model by 
Forgas (1995)
 theorizes that emotions influence decision-making and judgment through a mechanism of affect-congruent bias. For instance, individuals in a positive emotional state are more likely to access positive information and thus behave in a more optimistic and confident manner. Conversely, those in a negative emotional state are predisposed to recall and consider negative information, leading to more pessimistic, careful, and socially-constrained decision-making 
(Forgas, 1995)
.
However, valence-based approaches cannot explain evidence regarding the differential effects that emotions of the same valence have on decision-making 
(Lerner et al., 2015)
. To address this limitation, Lerner and colleagues 
(Lerner et al., 2015;
Lerner & Keltner, 2000
, 2001
 developed the appraisaltendency framework (ATF), which proposes that each emotion activates specific cognitive predispositions to evaluate future events, known as an appraisal tendency. In short, appraisal tendencies are goaldirected, meaning that they aim to resolve the problem or situation that initially elicited the emotion.
These tendencies continue to influence judgement and choices until the problem or situation that triggered the emotion is resolved. The ATF predicts that emotions of the same valence can have opposite effects on decision-making and vice versa for emotions of opposite valence, which has been supported by multiple studies (see 
Lerner et al., 2015
 for a review of evidence).
Based on the cognitive appraisal theory of emotion 
(Smith & Ellsworth, 1985)
, which underpins the ATF, 
Yip and Lee (2022)
 recently proposed the 'Emotions and Ethics' (EE) framework for understanding the effects of emotional experiences on unethical behaviour. This account posits that an emotion, when activated, may predispose and sensitize the individual to appraise future events in terms of consequences, i.e., benefit or harm, for themselves or others. That is, emotions may bias individuals to become self-focused, and thus elicit self-serving deception; or they may bias individuals to become other-focused, which instead will be associated with truth-telling or prosocial lies 
(Yip & Lee, 2022)
.
Specifically, based on the EE framework, distinct emotions may elicit various degrees of focus on self vs others, which might be more associated with one of four types of deceptive choices: egoistic lies, prosocial lies, pareto lies (where dishonesty is thought to be mutually beneficial for the liar and the other person/s), or spiteful lies (when someone lies to hurt others and no benefits for oneself are present). For instance, anger, which would be associated with focus on the self in terms of beneficial consequence and with a focus on others in terms of harmful consequences, should elicit higher rates of egoistic lies than gratitude, characterized by the opposite pattern of cognitive appraisal 
(Yip & Lee, 2022)
. To date, the interplay between incidental emotional experiences and deceptive behaviour has not been systematically investigated, and this study is designed to address this research gap.
Risk perception is another dimension influenced by the intersection of emotions and cognitive appraisal, initially examined under the ATF by 
Lerner and Keltner (2001)
. They found that anger, which is linked to cognitive appraisals of certainty and personal control, led to more reckless and risky behaviour, while fear, associated with appraisals of uncertainty and situational control, led to more cautious and riskaversive decisions. Notably, happiness, which is also characterized by appraisals of certainty and personal control, had a similar impact on choices as anger did, supporting the idea that cognitive appraisal factors, rather than valence, might better explain the effects of incidental emotions on decision-making.
The experimental design of this study incorporates the risk associated with being caught in deception to assess its impact on the dynamics between incidental emotions and dishonest decisions.
The present study utilizes the Temptation to Lie Card Game (TLCG) 
(Panasiti et al., 2011)
 to investigate the effects of three incidental emotions, namely anger, gratitude, and happiness, on dishonest decisionmaking. The TLCG is an experimental paradigm developed by our research group 
(Panasiti et al., 2011)
, which, compared to classic deception paradigms, includes all three essential components needed to mimic real-life deception (Delgado-Herrera et al., 2021), i.e., the opportunity to lie out of own volition, a monetary reward for lying, and social context (see 
Azevedo et al., 2018;
Dupont et al., 2023;
Panasiti et al., 2011
Panasiti et al., , 2014
Panasiti et al., , 2016
Schepisi et al., 2020;
Vabba et al., 2022)
. Crucially, when deciding whether to lie in social situations, people may be confronted with threats to their moral reputation, an essential aspect of individuals' moral integrity 
(Vonasch et al., 2018)
. On this, studies using the TLCG found that people's tendency to tell egoistic lies decreased when they were told their opponent would be informed about their deceptive choices, in other words, when their reputation was at risk 
(Azevedo et al., 2018;
Dupont et al., 2023;
Panasiti et al., 2011
Panasiti et al., , 2014
Panasiti et al., , 2016
Schepisi et al., 2020;
Vabba et al., 2022)
.
In fact, two key findings have been repeatedly found in studies implementing the TLCG, namely that people tend to lie more for self-gain than for other-gain and that people decrease their self-gain lying behaviour when there is a risk of getting caught 
(Azevedo et al., 2018;
Dupont et al., 2023;
Panasiti et al., 2011
Panasiti et al., , 2014
Panasiti et al., , 2016
Schepisi et al., 2020;
Vabba et al., 2022)
. Additionally, participants' deceptive behaviour in reputation risk conditions during the TLCG was found to be associated with personality traits of Machiavellianism and social desirability 
(Panasiti et al., 2011;
Dupont et al., 2023)
.
This research aims to build on existing literature by exploring how incidental emotions influence the likelihood of lying, particularly when an individual's moral reputation is at stake. It will also investigate how variations in personality traits may modulate these deception-related decisions. Based on the theoretical background summarized above, we expect that the effects of incidental emotions on lying behaviour will follow the predictions made by the EE 
(Yip & Lee, 2022)
 and ATF 
(Lerner et al., 2015)
 appraisal tendency frameworks. Specifically, we predict that incidental anger and happiness, promoting focus on the self in terms of benefits, will be associated with a higher rate of egoistic lies than gratitude -as assessed by the TLCG. Moreover, incidental anger and happiness, linked to appraisals of certainty and personal control, should be associated with a higher rate of egoistic lies during high reputation risk conditions than gratitude. As concerns the association between lying behaviour and target personality traits, we expect that a higher rate of egoistic lies will be correlated with a higher tendency to disregard moral standards and benefit oneself at the expense of others (Machiavellian amorality) and with a lower bias towards pleasing others (impression management). Moreover, we will explore the links between these personality traits and lying behaviour after the induction of specific emotions.


Materials and methods
Participants. Participants included 124 adults (18+; 62 females, mean age = 28.34 years, SD = 7.1, range = 20-54 years). They were recruited through the online participant recruitment platform Prolific and were paid £5 (£7.5 per hour) for their participation. Participants were informed they could receive an extra monetary reward based on their task performance, although all were ultimately compensated equally (£5). This was done to incentivize their spontaneous behaviour during the experiment (i.e., lying to gain extra reward when they felt to do so). At the end of the experiment, participants were debriefed about this procedure.
The sample size was chosen on account of a simulation-based power calculation utilizing simr 
(Green & MacLeod, 2016)
 in RStudio. The parameters of interests on which to build the simulation (e.g., fixed effects) were taken from results included in a previous study implementing the TLCG -interaction effect between outcome (favourable/unfavourable) and reputation (high risk/low risk) in a generalized linear mixed model with rate of lies as dependent variable 
(Dupont et al., 2023)
. The simulation (1000 iterations) revealed that, with an alpha value of 0.05, 40 participants would be sufficient to detect the effect of interest with 80% power. This sample size was multiplied by the three emotion conditions, thus giving a total sample of 120 participants. After data collection, we ended up with 124 participants (4 people completed the online task before we could terminate the data collection, so we included them in the final analyses), divided in three groups according to the emotion condition: 42 for anger, 41 for gratitude, and 41 for happiness.
The experimental protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS and followed the ethical standards of the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave their informed consent to take part in the study and were naïve to the purposes of the research.


Tasks
Autobiographical emotional memory task for emotion induction. The main aim of this study was to test the effects of incidental emotions on lying behaviour. To elicit incidental emotions, we implemented a procedure that is considered highly reliable for this purpose 
(Mills & D'Mello, 2014)
: participants were asked to recall, and then briefly write down, an autobiographical emotional experience belonging to one of three emotion categories, that is anger, gratitude, and happiness. -The choice of having two positive emotions (happiness and gratitude) and one negative emotion (anger) is dictated by the aim of comparing a multi-dimensional approach to the effects of incidental emotions on decision-making with a valence-based approach. If valence is sufficient to account for the influences of emotion on lying behaviour, then emotions of the same valence should have similar effects on deception. Alternatively, we suggest that cognitive appraisals of focus on the self vs focus on others and of personal control and certainty vs situational control and uncertainty (associated with risk perception) can better explain emotion-deception interactions 
(Lerner et al., 2015;
Yip & Lee, 2022)
. If this is the case, emotions of the same valence might have opposite effects on lying behaviour -as per our hypotheses.
The Temptation to Lie Card Game is an experimental paradigm that investigates intentional deceiving related to monetary reward. It was developed by 
Panasiti and colleagues (2011)
 and it has since been used to test the effect of multiple dispositional and contextual factors on lying behaviour 
(Azevedo et al., 2018;
Dupont et al., 2022;
Panasiti et al., 2011
Panasiti et al., , 2014
Panasiti et al., , 2016
Schepisi et al., 2020;
Vabba et al., 2022)
. The decision of whether to deceive usually involves a motivational conflict between the temptation to achieve some benefit (e. g., money) through dishonest means and the desire to act in a socially appropriate manner 
(Mead et al., 2009;
Panasiti et al., 2011)
. The TLCG can induce this motivational conflict and further consider two essential features that contribute to the lying/truth balance, that is intentionality and sociality 
(Panasiti et al., 2011)
. In fact, in the TLCG, the study subject plays against another person and can freely choose whether to deceive (or not) the opponent for monetary reward.
Specifically, the TLCG is an economic game between two players wherein the participant's opponent always starts the game by selecting one out of two covered cards. The basic rule of the game is: the ace of hearts is associated with a win (hence, a monetary reward), whereas the ace of spades is associated with a loss (no reward). Following the opponent's pick, the remaining card goes to the participant.
However, the opponent does not immediately know which card they picked. Indeed, the card selected by the opponent is first shown to the participant, who must communicate the outcome to them. In doing so, the participant knows that they can tell the truth, i.e., accepting the outcome of the game, or lie and change it. Specifically, if the opponent picked the ace of hearts and won (unfavourable outcome for the participant), the participant can lie to reverse the result to their own advantage (egoistic lie). If the opponent picked the ace of spades (favourable outcome for the participant), the participant can lie to reverse the result to the opponent's advantage (prosocial lie) ( 
Fig. 1
).
During the initial instructions phase, participants were told that they would be matched and play the online TLCG with another player. However, this opponent did not exist, and the participants played against an algorithm that won half of the times. We took precautions to make participants believe they were playing against a real opponent, such as having a fake "pairing player" phase and jittering in time the opponent's choices (i.e., the algorithm's choices).
Participants played at the TLCG twice: one time before the emotion induction phase (see previous section) and one time after it. In both sessions, they completed four blocks of twelve trials each. In two of these blocks, participants were informed that there would be a high probability that their opponent would find out about their decisions, i.e., whether they were lied or told the truth (high reputation risk condition). In the remainder two blocks, participants were told that there would be a low probability that their opponent would find out about their decisions (low reputation risk condition). The high reputation risk and low reputation risk blocks were further signalled by a pair of open eyes and closed eyes, respectively, appearing in the upper left corner of the screen. The order of blocks and the order of trials within each block were randomized across participants. A practice block was included to make sure participants correctly understood the instructions. General procedure. The study was conducted online utilizing three platforms: Prolific (for participant recruitment), Qualtrics (for study info, informed consent, and surveys), and Pavlovia (to host the main experimental task). The experiment was designed offline using PsychoPy. Three groups of participants were assigned to three different incidental emotion conditions -anger, gratitude, and happiness. This was done to avoid any carry-over effect associated with within-subjects design 
(Charness et al., 2012)
.
Participants started the experiment by reading the study information and signing the informed consent.
Following, they completed three questionnaires tapping into relevant individual dispositions, i.e., the Balance Inventory of Desirable Responding -Short Version (BIDR-SV) 
(Bobbio & Manganelli, 2011)
, which measures self-deception and impression management, both related to social desirability; the Machiavellian Personality Scale (MPS) 
(Dahling et al., 2009)
, which measures people's propensity to distrust others, engage in amoral manipulation, seek control over others, and seek status for oneself.
After this first phase, participants completed the main experimental task, which consisted of playing the TLCG before and after an emotion induction phase (see previous sections). Lastly, participants completed a questionnaire measuring their involvement in the game and their perception of one's own and the opponents' game strategies (see 
Supplementary materials)
.
Data pre-processing and analysis. The data from the TLCG were handled and pre-processed in Python. The pre-processing steps included the extraction of individual data files from an online database (Pavlovia) and the creation of subject-wise data matrices and a final aggregated data matrix for analysis.
From this final data matrix, we removed TLCG trials in which participants took less than 0.15 seconds to make a lie/truth decision, as we deemed their response in this case unreliable.
Data analysis was carried out in RStudio (R Core Team, 2021). As our dependent variable (participants' decision in the TLCG) was dichotomous (Lie = 1, Truth = 0), we linearly modelled it via a generalized linear mixed model utilizing the glmer function (lme4 package) 
(Bates, 2016)
 and assuming it followed a binomial distribution. In doing so, we also efficiently dealt with dependency in the data (within-subjects factors). Our models included three fixed effects -Outcome of the game (favourable/unfavourable) and Reputation (probability of getting caught lying; high risk/low risk) as within-subject factors and induced Emotion (anger, gratitude, happiness) as between-subject factor -and their interactions as well as by-subject intercepts (random effect). To determine the statistical significance of our fixed effects predictors, we conducted a Type III Wald Anova using the car package 
(Fox & Weisberg, 2019)
.
We evaluated the performance of the model fit via the r2() function from the performance package 
(Lüdecke et al., 2021)
 in RStudio, which computes the conditional r-squared values for mixed effects models with random effects structures.
To test whether the effects of induced emotion on lying behaviour would be more in line with a valencebased account or with Yip and Lee's EE framework 
(Yip & Lee, 2022)
, we performed contrast analysis by setting the "happiness" level of the Emotion factor as the reference to which compare the remaining two levels (anger and gratitude). In this way, we could compare a positive emotion supposed to promote focus on the self, and thus egoistic lies (happiness, according to 
Yip & Lee, 2022)
, with anger, a negative emotion also associated with focus on the self and egoistic lies, and gratitude, a positive emotion linked instead to focus on the others and altruistic lies.

Results
Descriptive hedonometrics analysis. The emotion induction procedure we utilized produced text data concerning the emotional experiences the participants recollected. We decided to analyse these data via sentiment analysis 
(Nandwani & Verma, 2021)
. 
Figure 2
 shows the cumulative sum of total words in sentences by emotion group (anger: 3963; gratitude: 3719; happiness: 3261) ( 
Fig. 2A, top panel)
 and the by-group average polarity score (sum of all polarity scores for that group divided by the number of sentences written) ( 
Fig. 2A, bottom panel)
. As it is apparent from the figure, anger recollections were characterized by negative polarity scores while gratitude and happiness by positive polarity scores. A between-subjects ANOVA revealed a main effect of induced emotion on polarity scores (F(2) = 27.85, p < 0.001), with anger significantly differing from happiness (est. = 0.28, t = 7.04, p < 0.001) and gratitude (est. = -0.22, t = -5.68, p < 0.001). A series of Pearson's correlations between the rate of egoistic lies and by-subject polarity scores revealed no significant results in any of the three emotion groups. 
Figure 2B
 shows by-emotion word clouds, where the most used words for the induction of anger, gratitude, and happiness were respectively "angry", "grateful" (excluding the word "life"), and "happy". 


Effects of emotion induction on lying behaviour.
To test the differential effects of the induction of anger, gratitude, and happiness on lying behaviour, we ran a statistical model with the data stemming from the post-emotion induction TLCG. This model included Outcome, Reputation, and Emotion as explanatory variables and the by-subject rate of lies at the pre-emotion induction TLCG as covariate -we ran a socalled covariate model 
(Weiss, 2005)
. This model had goodness-of-fit of R 2 cond = 0.79. We found main effects of game Outcome (χ 2
(1) = 134.62, p < 0.001) and Reputation risk (χ 2 (1) = 8.09, p = 0.004) and an interaction between the two factors (χ 2
(1) = 4.03, p = 0.04). Participants lied more when the outcome of the game was unfavourable to them (z = -11.60, p < 0.001) and when there was, overall, a lower chance of getting caught lying (z = -2.84, p = 0.004). In line with previous work using the TLCG, a high risk of getting caught lying, compared with low reputation risk, reduced participants' lying rate only in the unfavourable condition (z = 2.01, p = 0.04) 
(Fig. 3A)
.
Importantly, we found an Outcome * Emotion interaction (χ 2
(2) = 11.67, p = 0.003). Planned contrasts revealed that the effect of an increase in the probability (log-odds) of lying during unfavourable, compared with favourable, conditions (main effect of Outcome) was stronger after the induction of anger compared with happiness (z = -3.33, p < 0.001; average lie proportion change: anger = 0.17 vs. happiness = 0.11). In turn, the same effect was stronger after the induction of happiness compared with gratitude (z = -2.09, p = 0.03; average lie proportion change: happiness = 0.11 vs. gratitude = 0.10) 
(Fig.   3B
). Lastly, we found a Reputation * Emotion interaction (χ 2
(2) = 6.53, p = 0.03). However, this effect collapsed together the rate of lies for both favourable (very low proportion of lies, ~ 0) and unfavourable conditions, but we found no effect of high vs. low reputation risk on favourable ones (that is, altruistic lies).
Thus, we decided to run a model with the rate of egoistic lies as outcome variable (again, with the rate of lies at the pre-emotion induction TLCG as covariate), as we were interested in the interaction between emotional state and the risk of getting caught for this type of deceptive behaviour. This model had goodness-of-fit of R 2 cond = 0.89. We found a main effect of Reputation risk (χ 2 (1) = 10.9, p < 0.001) and
an interaction of this with the Emotion factor (χ 2 (2) = 10.69, p = 0.004). Replicating the above results, participants reduced the number of egoistic lies when there was a high risk of getting caught (z = -3.30, p < 0.001). Planned contrasts revealed that the effect of a reduction in the probability (log-odds) of egoistic lies during high risk, compared with low risk, conditions (main effect of Reputation) was stronger after the induction of anger compared with happiness (z = -2.51, p = 0.01; average egoistic lie proportion change: anger = 0.26 vs. happiness = 0.05). In turn, the same effect was stronger after the induction of gratitude compared with happiness (z = -2.92, p = 0.003; average egoistic lie proportion change: gratitude = 0.12 vs. happiness = 0.05) 
(Fig. 3C)
.
Associations between lying behaviour and target personality traits. First, we were interested in reporting possible associations between the rate of egoistic lies and specific personality traits. We correlated the rate of egoistic lies for both high reputation and low reputation risk conditions (at the post-emotion induction TLCG and for all the emotions combined) with the personality traits of interest, utilizing Spearman's rank correlation. Where no a priori hypotheses were present, false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing (with a significance threshold of p < 0.05) was used.
A higher rate of egoistic lies during both reputation conditions was associated with higher scores at the Amorality subscale of the MPS (low reputation risk: ρ = 0.37, p < 0.001; high reputation risk: ρ = 0.30, p = 0.001), which measures a tendency to disregard moral standards and value behaviours that benefit oneself at the expense of others (amoral manipulation) 
(Dahling et al., 2009)
. Moreover, the rate of egoistic lies during both reputation conditions was negatively correlated with the scores at the Impression Management subscale of the BIDR (low reputation risk: ρ = -0.40, p < 0.001; high reputation risk: ρ = -0.38, p < 0.001), which measures a bias towards pleasing others 
(Hart et al., 2015)
. See Supplementary materials for further insights on the associations between egoistic lies in high and low reputation risk conditions and personality traits.
To examine whether these personality traits would also be differentially associated with egoistic lies when participants were in a specific emotional state, we ran exploratory correlation analyses for the three induced emotions separately. We found, after multiple comparisons correction, that the rate of egoistic lies (at the post-emotion induction TLCG) when participants were induced with happiness (ρ = 0.41, p = 0.02) but not anger (ρ = 0.33, p = 0.06) and gratitude (ρ = 0.33, p = 0.11) were significantly correlated with the Amorality subscale of the MPS. A higher egoistic lies rate was also associated with higher distrust for others when participants were in angry (ρ = 0.41, p = 0.02) but not happy (ρ = 0.35, p = 0.10) and grateful (ρ = -0.04, p = 0.81) states. Finally, the rate of egoistic lies after anger (ρ = -0.45, p = 0.04) and happiness (happiness: ρ = -0.52, p = 0.02) but not gratitude induction (ρ = -0.25, p = 0.34) was negatively correlated with the scores at the Impression management subscale (see 
Fig. 4
). 


Discussion
This study was designed to investigate the influence of various incidental emotions on dishonest decision-making, particularly in situations where personal reputation was at stake. Our research drew upon the Emotions and Ethics (EE) framework proposed by 
Yip and Lee (2022)
, positing that the cognitive appraisals mechanisms triggered by different incidental emotions could sway the likelihood of engaging in unethical behaviour. Previous work has shown that anger facilitates egocentrism 
(Yip & Schweitzer, 2019)
, decreases empathy 
(Yip & Schweitzer, 2016)
, and is generally associated with a cognitive appraisal of other-person control 
(Smith & Ellsworth, 1985)
. To our knowledge, only one other study investigated the effect of incidental anger on intentional deceiving when interacting with another person: 
Yip and Schweitzer (2016)
 demonstrated that participants who felt incidental anger were more likely to deceive another person during a Deception Game 
(Gneezy, 2005)
 than those who felt a neutral emotion. Similar to anger, happiness has been linked to cognitive appraisals of certainty about the environment and optimistic evaluation of situations 
(Smith & Ellsworth, 1985)
, which in turn might promote egocentrism 
(Converse et al., 2008)
. Beyond our work, there are currently no other studies investigating the effect of happiness on intentional deceiving in a social setting 
(Yip & Lee, 2022)
. Following 
Yip and Lee (2022)
, a prediction could be made that people in a happy state are less considerate of others and more prone to deceive, compared to people that are in an emotional state that sensitize them to focus on benefit for others rather than benefit for the self, such as gratitude. Gratitude is another emotion characterized by cognitive appraisals of other-person control 
(Smith & Ellsworth, 1985)
 but, contrary to anger, it promotes evaluation of benefit for others, feelings of being "in debt", and prosocial behaviour. This would be associated, according to 
Yip and Lee (2022)
's model, to more truth-telling and even prosocial lies 
(Yip & Lee, 2022)
.
In line with the EE model's predictions, our findings indicate that the relationship between incidental emotions and deception are based more on cognitive appraisal mechanisms: participants that previously experienced emotions of anger and happiness commit more egoistic lies under conditions of loss in the card game, as opposed to those that experienced gratitude. These findings lend credence to the EE framework's utility in understanding the multifaceted nature of incidental emotions' effects on moral decision-making, and challenges the valence-based approach 
(Forgas, 1995;
Keltner & Lerner, 2010;
Lerner et al., 2015)
.
Another aim of this study was to test the effects of incidental emotions on deceptive behaviour when participants could be caught lying, i.e., during high vs. low reputation risk conditions. Previous work has shown that one's risk perception is shaped by the relationship between incidental emotions and cognitive appraisal of future events 
(Lerner et al., 2015)
. For instance, 
Lerner and Keltner (2001)
 demonstrated that anger, linked to cognitive appraisals of personal control, led individuals to engage in more risky and careless actions; on the other hand, fear, associated with appraisals situational control, led to more pessimistic and risk-aversive decisions. In the same study, happiness, also characterized by appraisals of personal control, had a similar impact on choices than anger did, thus confirming that cognitive appraisal factors more than valence better explain the effects of incidental emotion on decision-making. Based on these premises, we hypothesized that incidental anger and incidental happiness, linked to appraisals of personal control and risk-taking 
(Lerner et al., 2015)
, would be associated with a similar rate of egoistic lies during high reputation risk conditions, a rate that would appear higher than that of induced incidental gratitude, which is associated instead with appraisals of situational control 
(Ding et al., 2014)
 and risk aversion in decision-making 
(Zhang et al., 2020)
. Here, we report results that are coherent with this set of hypotheses: while the rate of egoistic lies after anger induction was much higher than after happiness induction during low-risk conditions, a high probability of getting caught lying stabilized this rate to a similar level for both emotions -note though, that this rate was still slightly higher after anger induction; on the other hand, the rate of egoistic lies after the induction of gratitude was higher during low-risk conditions and lower during high-risk ones than that following the induction of happiness -reflecting an increase in risk aversion during intentional deceiving following the induction of gratitude.
Previous studies have shown that lying behaviour during the TLCG, and specifically egoistic lies, are tightly linked to personality traits of Machiavellianism and social desirability 
(Dupont et al., 2023;
Panasiti et al., 2011)
. Here, we observed the same type of associations. Participants higher in amorality control and distrust for others MPS traits produced more egoistic lies during both reputation conditions. These two MPS subscales measure a tendency to disregard moral standards and value behaviours that benefit oneself at the expense of others (amoral manipulation) and a tendency to look others' behaviours and motivations in terms of negative implications for the self (distrust for others) 
(Dahling et al., 2009)
. Furthermore, participants lower in impression managements BIDR traits, which are linked to a bias towards pleasing others 
(Hart et al., 2015)
, produced more self-gain lies in both reputation conditions.
Concerning these associations between the tendency to lie in one's own favour and Machiavellianism and social desirability, we report differential modulations linked to the emotion induction. Only after anger and happiness induction, participants with higher 'distrust for others' traits produced more selfserving lies, which is interestingly in line with studies suggesting a link between these two emotions and an increase in egocentrism and a concern for others in terms of negative outcomes 
(Converse et al., 2008;
Yip & Schweitzer, 2019;
Yip & Lee, 2022)
. Similarly, participants with lower impression management BIDR traits produced more self-serving lies, but only after the induction of anger and happiness. These findings provide additional insight by revealing how specific emotions modulate the influence of personality traits on deceptive actions.
In conclusion, our investigation highlights the nuanced roles that emotions play in ethical decisionmaking, particularly in the context of deception. The study not only corroborates the EE framework 
(Yip & Lee, 2022)
 but also demonstrates the significance of incorporating personality traits and perceived risk into our understanding of deceptive behaviour. The findings underscore the need for a multidimensional approach to studying the ethical implications of emotions, opening avenues for future research to further elucidate these complex dynamics.


Final considerations and limitations
Online experimentation present a few setbacks 
(Lefever et al., 2007)
. However, we believe that, for our study, its advantages outweighed its disadvantages 
(Gosling & Mason, 2015)
. We were able to recruit a large number of participants and assign them to three different emotion manipulation groups, so that we could maintain the foreseen level of statistical power. We tested (also) non-student participants, who, especially in the psychology field, usually take part in research in exchange for course credits, which could be associated with less engagement on their side. Related to this, people take part in online experiments for monetary reward, and this allowed us to maximize the potential of our deception paradigm by telling them they would receive extra reward based on their performance at this task. This likely contributed to them behaving in a more spontaneous way (e.g., lying for monetary gain when they felt to do so). Lastly, concerning the overall validity of our study, we note that we were able to obtain in large part the expected results, including a replication of previous findings of studies utilizing the TLCG 
(Azevedo et al., 2018;
Dupont et al., 2023;
Panasiti et al., 2011
Panasiti et al., , 2014
Panasiti et al., , 2016
Schepisi et al., 2020;
Vabba et al., 2022)
.
Second, as said, we divided the participants in three groups, one for each emotion. This resulted in a mixed design with the Emotion variable as a between-subject factor. While it is known that withinsubjects designs are statistically more powerful and less affected by individual differences 
(Charness et al., 2012)
, the use of this in the current study would have meant having three different experimental sessions (one for each emotion), practically not feasible -as it would have also not been feasible including all emotion manipulation conditions within a single session, for both time management and carry-over effects reasons.
Lastly, we note that, while the emotion induction procedure we utilized is considered highly reliable for this purpose 
(Mills & D'Mello, 2014)
, we were not able, with our paradigm, to assess the emotional state of our participants throughout the experiment after the emotion induction procedure -as a consequence, variability in how long the emotional state lasted between participants might have affected our results. We suggest next studies take this factor into consideration by implementing an online evaluation of participants' emotional state during the decision-making task -which will, however, inevitably increase the duration of the experiment.


Conclusions
Using a validated experimental paradigm, the TLCG, we investigated the modulatory effects of three incidental emotions, i.e., anger, gratitude, and happiness, on deceptive behaviour, specifically lying for monetary reward. Our results were consistent with cognitive appraisal accounts, and in particular the Emotions and Ethics framework 
(Yip & Lee, 2022)
, which posits that the effects of incidental emotions on deception are linked to cognitive appraisals of benefit or harm for self or others that each emotion might activate. Our results pave the way for further theory-based investigations of the effects of incidental emotions on decision-making in general, and deceptive decision-making in particular.
