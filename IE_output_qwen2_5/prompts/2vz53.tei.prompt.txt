You are an expert in psychology and computational knowledge representation. Your task is to extract key scientific information from psychology research articles to build a structured knowledge graph.

The knowledge graph aims to represent the relationships between psychological **topics or constructs** and their associated **measurement instruments or scales**. Specifically, for each article, extract information in the form of triples that capture:

1) The psychological topic or construct being studied
2) The measurement instrument or scale used to assess it
3) A brief justification (1–3 sentences) from the article text supporting this measurement link

Guidelines:
- Extract meaningful **phrases** (not full sentences or vague descriptions) for both `topic_or_construct` and `measured_by`, suitable for inclusion in a knowledge graph.
- Include a short justification for each extraction that clearly supports the connection.
- If the article does not discuss psychological constructs and how they are measured (e.g., no mention of constructs, instruments, or scales), return an empty list `[]`.

Authors' Introduction
An influential program of psychological research suggests that people's judgements and decisions depend on the way in which information is presented, or 'framed'. In a central choice paradigm, decision-makers seem to adopt different preferences, and different attitudes to risk, depending on whether the options specify the number of people who will be saved or the corresponding number who will die. It is standardly assumed that such responses violate a foundational tenet of rational decision-making, known as the principle of description invariance. However, recent theoretical and empirical research has begun to challenge the dominant 'irrationalist' narrative. The alternative approaches being developed typically pay close attention to how decisionmakers represent decision problems (including their interpretation of numerical quantifiers or predicate choice). They also highlight the need for a more robust characterization of the description invariance principle itself.
5. What might be some other philosophical implications of the research on framing effects? How could these be explored in future work?


Seminar/Project Ideas:
Write a proposal for an experiment that would pit at least two competing accounts of framing processes against each other and that would be informative no matter how the results turn out. Clearly define the hypotheses to be tested, the independent variable or variables to be manipulated and the dependent variable or variables to be measured.
Divide the class into two debating teams (or sets of teams, if the class is large) that either argue for or against the proposition, "The findings of the original disease problem by 
Tversky and Kahneman (1981)
 demonstrate irrationality in human decision-making."

Focus Questions








Should an account of risky-choice framing effects consider how decision-makers represent choice problems? What do alternative accounts (e.g. prospect theory, fuzzy trace theory, and the lowerbounding account) say about the issue of representation, and the connection between representation and choice?












How strong is the empirical evidence for the prospect theory account of risky-choice framing effects? Should it be defended, modified, or abandoned in favor of an alternative approach?












What are the points of connection/ difference between Tombu and Mandel's explicated valence account, Levin et al.'s associationist account, and Sher & McKenzie's information leakage account? 4. What is the most plausible way of characterizing the description invariance principle? Does it apply in all decision-making contexts?
